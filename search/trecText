The pizza was okay. Not the best I've had. I prefer Biaggio's on Flamingo / Fort Apache. The chef there can make a MUCH better NY style pizza. The pizzeria @ Cosmo was over priced for the quality and lack of personality in the food. Biaggio's is a much better pick if youre going for italian - family owned, home made recipes, people that actually CARE if you like their food. You dont get that at a pizzeria in a casino. I dont care what you say...

Back in 2005-2007 this place was my FAVORITE thai place EVER. I'd go here ALLLLL the time. I never had any complaints. Once they started to get more known and got busy, their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half. I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a "Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money. I havent been back in over a year because I refuse to pay $10-15 for dinner and still be hungry after. Sorry PinKaow, you are not what you used to be!!

This place sucks. The customer service is horrible. They dont serve food unless you order a pizza from a neighboring restaurant. Who does that? They dont control their crowd. Many times I've gone I've seen fights. The bartenders suck - I've almost got in a fight with one because she was a complete bitch. Refused to serve me a drink because she was "busy" celebrating her friends birthday BEHIND THE BAR. This place is ridiculous. I will NEVER go there again.. EVER.

If you like Thai food, you have to try the original thai bbq. Their pad se ew is to DIE for. Their thai egg rolls are delicious. Basil beef will not let you down (its not on the menu anymore, you have to ask for it!) 

Yes, the building is not as fancy as some other places. Yes, i've batted a fly off my plate more than once. Yes, I do NOT go to the bathroom their because I dont even WANT to know what it looks like... 

BUT.. the thai food is the best in town. The service rocks. And you can get a $25 gift cert. on Restaurant.com for $2. Can you beat that? I think NOT.

This is the only place my husband and I go for anniversarys, date nights, birthdays.. anything!! I recommend it to everyone I know. If you KNOW good thai food, go here.

AMAZING!!!

 I was referred here by a friend and at first thought "Korean and Mexican?? WEIRD... i dont know"... but my husband and I were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place. We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.

THe service was great. The server was so nice and attentive- you could tell she was the owner. 

The only thing I'd change is their chips they serve. They were burnt, too thick and kind of bland but their salsa is great. And lets face it, i'm fat so I we ate two baskets anyway so they cant be that bad. lol

All in all, food was delicious, A LOT of food for cheap, great prices, great service great flavor. Hell even my burps taste delicious. Bahaha!

Ribs = amazing
2 hour wait time= not so amazing, but understandable. 

This place would get 5 stars if they expanded their BBQ restaurant. Their ribs are AMAZING. You get SO much food for the price and it tastes sooo good. Plus, the two hour wait isnt always a bad thing because it gives you an excuse to drink and gamble while you wait!

Food is pretty good, not gonna lie. BUT you have to make sacrifices if you choose to eat there. It literally takes an hour to an hour and a half to deliver food. Seriously. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Doesnt matter if we order at 8am, 10am or 1pm. Never fails, they take F-O-R-E-V-E-R. If you dont get what you ordered or you are upset by them delivering your breakfast around LUNCH time, be ready to have the owner talk down to you and be a total bitch to you for i dont know, just wanting what you pay for?! 

Its over priced. But its decently tasteful food. Takes forever. Owners a witch. And i'm pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off. 

End Rant. 

PS- I've never gone in there to eat because i frankly, i'd rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area. 

PPS- My hot chocolate today was cold. They should call it Cold Chocolate. Or start caring if their hot chocolate is hot. One of the two would be great!

The score should be negative. Its HORRIBLE. The have like 6-7 items in their buffet. No naans or salad. The items were either bland or stale. My friend had a potato curry which was completely stale without salt. The biriyani was okayish but bland. Would never recommend to anyone.

Sansotei serves some top notch ramen. They take no reservations, so my company of five had to wait outside for about half an hour. I guess it's normal for Saturday night. Unlike my favorite ramen place in NYC you can only order what's on a menu. No deviations or improvisations whatsoever. Our waitress didn't speak much English, and even after writing everything down still managed to make a mistake or two. But, my spicy sesame ramen called Tan Tan was exceptional. I can tell you that. Just the right thickness of broth, and taste - omg.

Fresh tortilla chip & salsa ready and waiting at the table when we sat down. Food was incredible! I ordered the combo with a beef tamale with red sauce & chicken enchilada. Both were full of meat from beginning to end & had so much flavor! Highly recommend this place

Food was alright, the service was HORRIBLE! Both of our orders came out incorrect after waiting extremely long because they don't write anything down when they take the orders. I asked for greens at the end she confirmed did you say grits? I said no greens please.. still ended up with grits. Boyfriends whole order came out wrong and when they brought him back the right order pretty sure they brought out my grits they took back 5 min before from my wrong order and gave them to him. Waitress came back and just set the plate down and walked off. No sorry about that, does it look right now, do you need anything else.. just straight nothing. Never came by our whole meal to check on us.

If I could leave zero stars I would. This rude B at the door with the fake lashes and colored lens was super rude. We had entered the club earlier and upon leaving the guy at the door told us we could come back later for the show. But when we came back, one man let us through up to the door, but the B there said there was no re-entry. She then proceeded to tell us that we could talk to "the guy by the exit". Okay. Well FYI, if you've never been to a venue, you don't know exactly where everything is. We walked away and looked around and weren't sure where she was referring to so we went back and asked where the exit was. She rudely responded, "I SAID. Go see the guy by the exit OVER THERE."  Felicia. 

Basically everyone was rude. Not coming back.

I have to write a review on the Fractured Prune. First off I love doughnuts second I used to work in a bakery. So I know a little about the almighty doughnut. I was there this past Thursday night at Westgate where I was having a nice dinner at Opah Life. I wanted a little desert so I went to this doughnut shop it seemed clean enough so I made my selections and took them home. Mistake should have eaten one there I would have ask for my money back. I took a bite out of each on to confirm what I thought they were the worst doughnuts I have ever had. Horrible not sure if the oils was rancid or not hot enough either way eat at your own risk.

I wish i could tell you all about the food but there was problem. My friend and went there for dinner we were seated quickly unfortunately it was in middle of the empty dinning room so we asked to be moved to the side which we were. Upon sitting down we were told we could only have one of the very small table tops there were two together so the hostess told us the manager said we couldn't use two table tops in the empty restaurant. So we got up and left. With the manager chasing us blaming the hostess for the the ridiculous action. Needles to say we will never return.

After gown shopping in Los Angeles and Orange County for 3 months and not having the "this is the one moment" I made an appointment at Destiny's Bride.  My mom, my sisters and I were having a girls weekend in Scottsdale and wanted to gown shop for fun.  Residing in southern CA, we weren't planning on purchasing a dress out of state.  The boutique absolutely blew us away and the service was even better! Lisa, the owner, was amazing and it was by far the best customer service and experience out of all the high end shops I visited in CA. 
Lisa is extremely knowledgeable and was able to quickly pick out gowns for my body shape and taste.  She was honest with her opinion and took her time with me.  Photos of me in the gowns were allowed which I loved because this was not an option in Los Angeles.  
I found "the one" with Lisa and because we paid that day in full, she offered us a 10% discount!

The shop, selection and customer service were all A+ and I can't wait to return the shop for my fitting and to see Lisa!

I was in Phoenix on business last week. My PHX based co-workers are frequent visitors and knowing I like BBQ, they took me to here. One word describes the food - amazing. I've had BBQ from a lot of places all over the country and the food here ranked at the top of the list for me. I had the two meat plate - brisket and pulled pork. Both were awesome. If you are in PHX and like BBQ, you have to come here. The line may be long, but it's truly worth the wait.

Easy access to the store with ample parking. If you want to be offered services you don't need, and given incorrect promo info, with no assistance on purchas products, this is THE place.

Came here with my son to pick up an online order and to have him look at phones. I got my phone and that was that, no offer to help set it up or tell me about cool features, I had to ask. I could sense the reluctance but my phone was set up, then strong push for Direct TV and a home alarm.

No acknowledgement of my son who was looking at phones, whom I asked (in front of the agent) if he found something (he did). Still no acknowledgement, so we left. Will probably get it online or find a store more willing to help. 

I miss the store inside PV mall. They were a 6 out of 5. Sad they closed.

Prefer the Harkins Theatres over AMC. Camelview for loungers, Tempe Marketplace to people and movie watch, Scottsdale for larger screens, and Shea when I'm feeling nostalgic.

It's very clean, someone is always cleaning or just finished cleaning the rest rooms. No popcorn droppings in the lobby, on the counters or condiment station. Always friendly, smiling faces ready to clean the auditorium after the movie.

The auditoriums don't have stadium seating but there's  and incline and easy to see the screen, chairs are comfortable but not as large as the newer chairs. There's a LOT of leg room. This is where we go when we want to watch a movie and 'travel' back in time to visit a movie theater very similar to the one we went to growing up.

Overall rating: 2.5 for a 4:30 weekday visit (no one at the bar and 4 tables, including us - mostly parties of 2, like us).

I've decided to count, from entering an establishment to the time our party is spotted to the time we are acknowledged or helped (no, I don't  speed count). This visit, it was 5 before we were spotted and 82 before a hostess came to seat us.

Place was clean, server prompt, nice. Salmon was dry, overcooked. Walnut and tempura shrimp were good but warm/cool, not hot. Liked the tofu and veggies. Fried prawns were tasty. Crab legs? Crab legs, nothing spectacular. The fried rice? Hardened, couldn't pay me to eat it. All the meat dishes, with the exception of almost well done prime rib (not happy that there was no one at the carving station to cut or anyone to call and ask) had an after taste of cough medicine - so did the tapioca, but cake was ok.

Also almost got run over by the hostess while on my way to get food, she was rushing toward the empty side of the restaurant. My response? Smile, and an 'oh, sorry excuse me.' Hers a raised eyebrow that became a frown and a parting huff. Wanna pay over $20 for that plus tax and tip? Go for it lol, I'll pass.

4 because there's this one cashier who, each time rang our purchases up (different weeks) always looked like a mix of anger and unhappiness for customers im general.

Store is clean, but I gotta say...having clothes for sale...somehow... I no longer wanna call it 'fancy frys' it now seems more like...'wannabe walmart.' 

Almost down to a 3 thanks to that, BUT the pharmacy staff....AweSOME! Super courteous and helpful, really great empathy toward each customer. Not an easy task but they are shining stars in my book.

2.5 stars. We've come here several times over the past few years and management is always different. This review is for   current management, supposedly 'original' management. 

I like that we no longer have to order and pay at the counter. We usually order calamari or calamari salad, katsu don.  This time the calamari was crispy but bland, the dipping sauce - no, thank you: tasted like mix of wasabi, tartar, and soap. Soy sauce saved the calamari.

Katsu don was super delicious and fresh. I was starving, finished mine and then went into a food coma. 

Staff was pleasant but the lower score is because: the place wasn't super busy (3 other tables, small parties 2-3 per table), and yet when we got there, our table was dirty - wiped away grease streak, 2 pcs of food laying on the table.

This place is closer to me than Tokyo Express...so I guess we'll come back.

Meh. 6 skinny mozzarella sticks for $7. It's an appetizer for and 1 adult and 1 toddler. Wish we just went to Costco to get a whole bag, but my teens were h-anger-y ;) 

Wednesday wings, glad they still have it. Stick with the original. I wouldn't recommend their wing sauce; their garlic parm is nothing compared to Long Wongs or Buffalo Wild Wings.

Fries were bland. The staff...they seemed "nice" but...off... 2-3x our server and this dude walked by said "how's everything going/tasting" and they kept walking without stopping or even really lookong at our table because each time that happened, one person in our party had an empty drink. They were just going through the smiles and verbal motions without actually...serving.

Would I go back to Hooters? Yes. This one? Neeeevvvaaahhhhhhh, go DOWNTOWN, not here.

Happy to be seated promptly on a Friday evening.  5 stars to Deb our waitress who was so pleasant, never let our drinks get low, and so quick to answer our questions.

My princess enjoyed her mac n cheese, the fettuccine was creamy, trio was huge, calamari = tasty. Spaghetti, meatballs and pomodoro were divine.

So why not a perfect rating? While we lucked out with Deb, I'm just not sure how others fared with the people helping them. Usually when we walk into or out of a restaurant, staff smile and say hi, say, "welcome to..." or acknowledge patrons in some way shape or form. Yesterday, all 4 of us were greeted with blank stares (again, except Deb).

Deeeeeeeeeeellllliiiissssshhhhhh!  More than a pleasant surprise, it's a super tasty delight. I expected yummy food and well, this was.....*sigh*.... ahhhhhhhhhhhh.

Regular fries were seasoned so well, burgers juicy, each item we tried had it's own flavor but blended really well together. Fresno chicken tacos....zing creeps up on you, paired with the sweetness of the carnival corn....more aaaahhhhhhs.

And the french toast fries.....OMG so good! Stop reading this and go there already (bring your friends and order different things so you can try it all).

Been coming here for years, always delicious food, served super fast, no matter how busy.

Service is excellent! Looking for real asian food? Head out to what my family calls, "Super D."

Pan fried noodles, salt and pepper pork chop are our faves.

More reasonably priced items here. Decent quality products. Good sales. Coupons are a bit confusing. Quite a few of them, but be sure to read the fine print otherwise you may be disappointed when you get to the store. My issue is that I called with the coupon on hand with a question thrying to clarify the exclusions but even the staff could not explain it to me. I do expect more from those who work there.

Regular starbucks, nothing special. No one exceptionally friendly or anything. Staff seemed more in a hurry to get back to chatting with one another, not really building rapport with customer. I guess I get it though, almost closing time. Quiet in here this evening.

Never been inside. Always a drive through experience. The place could use retouching of paint, etc. By place I mean what little I can see from the drive thru window ;)

Food? 4.  Super tasty. Picky eater son loves their chicken tacos.  Try the patron burrito. I have half for breakfast and half for linner (lunch/dinner). It's THAT big.

If only it wasn't in a casino, I'd give it a 5 and come back more often. Thankfully, no smell of smoke inside. 

We were seated promptly at a booth and had a good time. Came here expecting over priced, bland food. Apparently I was in for a surprise.

Our server was prompt and nice. Hubby gave him 8 out of 10 rating (we ran too low on drinks once). The foooooood.....best calamari ever! Crispy, soft, and TASTY without the deep fried oily feeling. Don't usually like tartar sauce but loved this one.

Linguini was delicious-nice, subtle zing and scrumptious prawn.  Steak was succulent and delectable. We didn't have room for dessert because the portions were huge.

Reasonably priced for great food and large portions.

Have not actually been inside so this will be a review of multiple drive thru experiences, not a 5 because I haven't been inside but I'll do that next time and update my review.

We usually go for chicken tacos, quesadillas (chicken and cheese), patron, AZ, or carne asada burritos. Food is always hot, order always correct.  Food tastes good, not overly salty and definitely bland. It isn't a gourmet meal, but it hits the spot. Prices have gone up a bit but at least they didn't shrink the portions. 

This place stands out for me because no matter how big or 'customized' our order is (e.g. no pico or easy in lettuce, etc.), they've ALWAYS been super patient when taking the order and then super nice when we pick up our food.

Busy holiday weekend, but all the staff from the ticket counter, concessions, and rest room attendants we really nice. Smiling without a hint of annoyance due to working on a holiday weekend with heavy traffic. 

It would have been a 3 due to smelly restroom but before I left, they were already on it. Service counts a lot.

Seats were comfortable with good leg room.

Comfortable seats, happy they are not separated in clusters/groups like other theaters with recliners (works well with an odd numbered group).

Love the different seating options available while waiting for the movie.

$14 after 6pm movies is a bit steep, suggest at least a senior or student discount.

Best place for dim sum in the valley.  Prefer this one to the one at Mekong Plaza in Mesa.  Pork siomai is the family favorite. Calamari is the bomb, when the cook isn't in (he gets in about 10-11am on weekends), we get the Salt and Pepper squid from the a la carte menu. Shrimp egg rolls, mmmmmmm.

Laser maze is a blast for the kids, check Groupon for deals so you don't break the bank.

Love the sitting area outside, great for waiting parents when the weather is cool and breezy.

Bummer that you can't even bring water for a birthday party, it's $0.99 per additional 8oz bottle, but it beats the $1.25 pouch of Carpi Sun.  My kids love ice cream but we couldn't bring an ice cream cake either.  Loosen up, allow us to bring water (this is AZ) and our own cakes for the parties.

Food taste: 2 
Time to receive food: 3
Customer Service: - 5 (yes, that's a negative)
Cleanliness: 3
Accuracy of order: 0

Liked that the screen is easier to read. Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. I'll take credit for signing and paying albeit confused, my mistake. Apparently lady assumed I only purchased a Groupon for (2 burgers and 2 sides). I pointed that out, she (lady 1) needed help and the lady (lady 2) who helped only asked the cash registrar for an explanation, not me. No sorry no nothing. Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.

Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'

As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.

Last week I told my sisters to eat here. Just sent a message on group chat telling them not to waste their time. Few weeks ago told my coworkers to stop by here when they're in the neighborhood, I'll tell them about this visit on Monday.

My advice to management: Tell staff to read, slow down, listen and understand how important customer service is.

Advice to Yelpers: Smash Burger or In N Out. Taste hasn't changed, service much better. If in Vegas, Wahlburgers.

Great prices when there's a $10 off coupon. Lots of fun screen printed shirts for teens/tweens. (hint: Star Wars) 

Do the math before buying one at regular price and getting the next for a penny. Just sayin' use the arithmetic from elementary school.

They do have a better selection online. Love that when a size was not in stock at tje store, they ordered it for me online for store pick up and applied the store coupon and I didn't even have to ask.

Are all the staff that nice? No, BUT they are waaaay more helpful than that other dept store that rhymes with 'acy's.'

This was a real fun time. Lots of laughs and entertainment. Love that the cast interactions with all guests in a semi intimate setting. Each course is delivered between scenes and you're given time to eat so you don't miss the show. 

Food was pretty decent as well. Like the salad dressing and love the sauce on the chicken. Bring cash for the bar and especially for the tip. Cast/staff work hard and deserve it :)

4 stars since I'm bummed there were no mojitos.

First time here started off with no line, by the time we left, drive through and inside lines were full.

Burger was ok, veggies were fresh, loved the sauce and fries. I drive by here a lot, would stop for the fries. Also, wish I had known the corn is seasonal.  

Why the 3? Service. It was our first time and it was obvious, felt more like the lady ready to take our order just wanted to get it over with and us out of the way.

Like I said no line when we got there, not inside and 1 car at the drive thru.

The 4-5 will depend on service next time.

First and last time at this location. We've been moving since 6am after a long work week. Pit stop at Starbucks for frappucinos (for some of our friends who helped) and then at Dunkin for coolatas (for the other half).

Excuse my husband for being tired, human and saying the wrong drink name, 'frappe' instead of coolata being that he was exhausted and needed a pick me up. Apparently that is a personal offense to the Dunkin team. Instead of saying they serve 'coolatas' they server and his shift leader told my husband to go to Starbucks. I hope the franchise owner reads this so they know customers are being told to go across the street.  And btw, 'shift leader,' 'frappes' are at McDonalds.

Want to be shamed for saying the wrong menu item? Head on down.

We came starving and left stuffed.  Always loved and still adore their calamari. Add the breadsticks and chicken/gnocchi soup...couldn't even finish my main course.  What we 'took' for dinner will probably be for brunch tomorrow.  

Jerry our server was amazing! He was the only one in our section so I can't say service was speedy, but he was always smiling and gracious with each party even though I could see 1 party getting anxious.  The fact that he kept his composure, professionalism, and remained gracious - I commend that kind of service. Kudos, Jerry! 

OG management, perhaps improve scheduling during the lunch rush?

Wow! Sponge cakes that almost melt in you mouth. So light! Watch yourself though, food is so light you may end up eating more than you should especially if you are trying to watch your waistline:)

He felt each coffee cake piece (to put in the bag) and didn't sell me one that felt soggy to the touch.  Asked for pork buns and he went to get the ones in the back that were fresh and cooling down.  Heated up the one piece I was going to eat in the car. (pork bun was so tasty!) All that without me having to ask. 

My fave are the mini sponge cakes with whipped topping and fruit on top, it's a little piece of heaven.  Having a party? Perfect dessert bite your guests will adore!

Horrible. The smart ones have closed their account. Tellers don't know how to read a day drop envelope that clearly reads MORTGAGE PAYMENT in front and back with the full loan number on it. Money was sitting in the account and in the meantime my mortgage was late. This has happened 4 times. 4 TIMES. 

Manager doesn't take accountability for the lack of attention to detail of his staff or their errors.  Tried to blame me because they didnt believe I put anything on the envelope. Account numbers and account holder names sitting all over Christopher the teller's desk. People wonder why your accounts are compromised? Manager saw it and did nothing. 

Be smart take you money out and run.

I did find the katsu sliced too thin it was no longer tender when fried. Sushi was ok, so was the calamari.

Scared to post a review because people might find it and crowds will come lol.

Pros: stadium seating, comfortable, large chairs, super ample leg room, clean theater. Manager is nice, he works concessions. Super decent pricing.

Cons: 3x since it opened, we've visited and either there was no picture or audio was messed up. They fixed it within 10 mins but we've not experienced that anywhere else but in a foreign country. Bathroom needs updating: tiles are looking pretty worn.

Kids love the baskets and also the burgers, cheese curds and concrete mixers are their faves. I like the rueben, but it's so hearty, I can't finish it all at once. The dinners are a great value too, pot roast with salad and a roll, yuuuuummmmm!

Place is always packed for weekend dinners, harder to get in if there's more than a party for two.

Giant portions, love that there's enough to share or to munch on the followinh day.  

Cheese crisp and p'zookie are our motivation to come here, wish tables were not too close together, but I get it's part of their charm, plus that would mean less tables and then there  would be a longer wait ;)

Where to begin? 1st timer at AMC Desert Ridge. Excited because of the recliner seats. Overwhelmed when we stepped inside. The Marketplace was...well, we thought it was like a hospital cafeteria with a lot less staff and a giant mess. Popcorn all over the floors and counters, condiments spilled, condiment droppings on the counter. Saw 2 girls with brooms - not cleaning but chatting it up with the cashier.

Gotta line up 3 times, one to order, another to pay, and another to pick up your order. Pure confusion for a 1st timer. So you go back, front, and back. Liked the soda machine cause you pick and mix. The 'bar?' It looks like  and afterthought with I think 5 stools.

The bathroom. GROSS. 4 stalls not completely flushed and 1 with wet droppings on the floor. 2 sinks without soap and the used papertowels were overflowing. The automatic machine was rolling the new ones into the used ones. Did I mention there was red/brown debris on the stainless steel? 

Ok recliners but I doubt anyone actually measured the distance from the screen to the seats because we were on 2nd to last row and it still felt too close. We got a headache.

We just had my son's 6th birthday party here today! The party was a combination of laser tag and arcade games.  We were greeted with a warm welcome upon arriving, and staff was very attentive to us throughout the party. Collin was AMAZING with keeping the party flowing and helping out with everything from the set up, serving of the food, to the clean up at the end. The price was right, and I would highly recommend King Putt on Stephanie in Henderson if you are looking into booking a party here.

I would have to say my husband and I are very disappointed about the professional photos Jon took for me, which I had planned to use for my upcoming job application. We searched Yelp and found him with all good reviews which made us decide to go to him for these very important pictures. The results are very disappointing! 

Jon seems to be a friendly person, except that in the beginning he tried to deny a Yelp deal that we purchased, as he claimed the deal is for family photos only, which was NOT said in the deal description when we purchased. Anyhow he accepted the deal we bought eventually. However, it turned out to be a terrible experience.  

First of all, his studio is in his house, or maybe more specifically, in his garage. Certainly it is not fun to take a one-hour-photo-shoot at such a place when the temperature is over 100 outside and there is limited air-conditioning in the garage. He had to use a fan trying to make it cooler. But most importantly, his technique is not very impressive at all.  My green dress turned out to be blue in my photos! The skin tone of my face in the pictures turned out to be uneven, despite the fact I was put on make-up by professional beauty artist. Also, his so-called touch-ups of the pictures are awful, that he didn't even try to take the shines on my face away! --- As a matter of fact, I don't think those pictures we purchased have been touched up at all!  

I am not sure if he is good at taking family pictures as other claimed in the reviews, but if you go for professional head-shots, I won't recommend him at all. It will be a total waste of your money and time!

Probably the worst experience at a hotel in Vegas I've ever had.  All of the construction was completely annoying, but one of the dealers in particular was pretty much a racist, and decided to get in a racially-motivated political debate with me.  Completely inappropriate.  She also wouldn't stop complaining about how she's made minimum wage there for like 10 years, which says something about their judgement to employ someone like that for 10 years without firing them.  She also made me feel really guilty for dropping a few hundred dollars at the blackjack table instead of tipping her that money.  I wish I had someone to report her to, but they don't really seem to care.  I will never be staying at this hotel EVER again, and would never suggest that anyone else does either, especially with all of the competition on the strip.  You can do MUCH better.

I didn't come here for the food but rather the bourbon list as I was told it was amazing....the bourbon list was if fact amazing....problem was they actually didnt carry any of the bourbon on the list....after being told up front ALL of the pappy van Winkle was out of stock, they list like 6 of them on their menu, I was shot down on my next 5 attempts to order a bourbon....all put of stock.  Really?  The bartender kept apologizing profusely but it was apparently all ongoing issue.  don't waste you time here...for the bourbon any way

I REALLY wanted to like this place. A lot of my friends have mentioned this restaurant and stated how much they enjoyed the food so my boyfriend and I decided to stop by last weekend. First off, they have an amazing staff. Very nice and accommodating. The hostess was great and our server was on top of everything. We really appreciated him informing us that he was going on break and to let the other server know if we needed anything, to just ask. However, we never saw anyone for the last 20 minutes that we were there. They were very busy so we decided not to stay any longer and just walked up to someone at the bar and asked for assistance.

The food..... what can I say... the chicken satay was amazing and I loved the peanut sauce. I ordered the panang curry and my bf ordered the yellow curry (I think).... we love the flavor, but I was disappointed at the amount of chicken they put (which was barely any at all) in the generous bowl of curry they served it with. It was mainly vegetables and I had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken hoping there was more at the bottom. I hate to do this, but I have to stress how VERY little meat there was in there :(  A few minutes later our pad Thai arrived. The noodles were completely white and the entire dish basically tasted like noodles with lime juice & veggies. Where's the rest of the sauce?!?! The only reason I gave three stars is because I liked the staff and the atmosphere. I don't think I'll be coming back unless one of my friends who love this place really wants to go.

STAY AWAY!!! Because I moved this was the closest to my new home. I had my oil and filter changed here about a month ago and after a week my "oil change" light came on. My bf mentioned maybe the guy just forgot to reset it so he reset it for me.... Last week it came on again and turned off after a few hours... the next day it was on all day... my bf decided to change the oil and filter himself and showed me that someone wrote on the filter to make sure we know it was changed and the date said JULY 2016!!!!! (see picture posted) This place hasn't changed my filter the both times I've come to them after telling them I need an oil and filter change. Both times I was also told it will take about 40min.... but only took 10.... did they even check anything else?  And I love how both times They asked if I was paying cash and when I told them cash, both times they're machine/computer was "down" so they were unable to print me a receipt...what're you guys doing in there???

I've been to a few ramen places in town and came here with my friend (who's a big ramen fan). We love how tender the meat was and the broth was perfect. Not too salty and greasy like other places we've been too. Most of all, amazing service as well. New ramen spot for us

I had an amazing time here. They were very busy but service was GREAT. ALL EMPLOYEES were making a team effort to acknowledge every guest, and were very engaging. We ate at the bar which I feel gave us a better experience as first timers. We ordered about 7 items and I absolutely loved every single one of them. The fish (entree) and oyster rockefellers were my favorite. The food came out one after the other and on time. I love when I don't have to wait too long for my food on a busy night and still have it come out presentable and taste amazing. I didn't get a chance to try their sushi BUT I'm coming back here with my girlfriends after they saw my post! See you again, soon!

I've been coming here for a while and I love how the food tastes the same every time. Delicious! I always either get the panang, pad thai, fried rice, larb, and/or chicken satay. Service is always great. I don't think I ever remember have bad or mediocre service here, and the food always comes out just in time. I'm giving it 4 stars because the food to price ratio doesn't match to me. I always end up either ordering more or stopping by somewhere later because I'm still hungry. I think they should either lower the price or add more food. Just my opinion.

2 of my girlfriends recommended this place so all 3 of us went.... I made sure to have an appetite when I got here..... sushi was mediocre.... what made it TERRIBLE was the service..... we were there for 2 and a half hours because our orders took about 30 min to come out whether it was appetizers or sushi.... our server's excuse was because the bar was full....? So you're telling me your main dining area (which was actually also pretty full ) should SUFFER just because the bar was full????? 

**someone replied to this comment saying to come on a Monday when it's not busy... umm so I have to come a different day to get even mediocre service? No thanks...

Vickie makes me feel so comfortable every time I go to her. She never rushes anything and she's very thorough and gentle. I've tried 3 different types of wax and hers is by far the best one. She explains every "after care products" she uses on me and I love that. If a product doesn't sit well with me, she immediately tells me not to use it and doesn't push me to use it. She even suggests other products that she doesn't carry just so we find something that works well with my skin. She definitely has my best interest at heart. Thank you Vickie!

The halo-halo was good! I got the mango toast and was a bit disappointed... the taste was very plain and didn't have a lot going on to it, but the presentation was cute. I think it was a little over priced. I could get halo-halo just as good for cheaper.

I've been here a few times with my family and there's really nothing for me to "complain" about.... their service is on point, if not, gets better every time we eat here, the taste of the food is always consistent, and the serving you get for the price is great. I've read plenty of comments about the service..... maybe you guys should make sure your staff is consistent with the service? I'd really hate to come here one day and end up with a server who doesn't take care of us.

The spicy wonton was my favorite. We ordered another round of it and the potstickers. I had the Shang beef noodle soup which was good, but would've been better if it wasn't too salty. I also had a taste of my friend's order of the Peking Zha Jiang noodles which was okay.

It might be a bit unfair to review Globe so early into their existence, but I don't feel too badly about it. Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.

Globe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.

I suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.

The main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.

The dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.

Despite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.

Truth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe.

I have been itching to get to Origin for months now after a friend of mine had gone and raved about the food. I dug the concept: tapas with a twist. This is definitely not your traditional, Spanish tapas. At Origin, you'll sample small plates with Asian, Italian and Latin influences. I didn't find the menu overwhelming, but our server was more than happy to help steer the meal so that similar and complimentary flavours were eaten together.

It was tough to narrow it down, as we would have been happy with just about anything on the menu. We started with the tostones: smashed, flattened and deep-fried plantains with guacamole on the side. The plantains were very well seasoned, with generous use of kosher salt and a light dusting of curry powder.

Next up were the deviled eggs with smoked bacon and gremolata and the smoked cod croquettes with saffron aioli. Both were a big hit at the table, disappearing in a flash. I preferred the croquettes of the two, but I didn't exactly NOT eat my share of the deviled eggs either.

Those scrumptious bites devoured, we ordered another bottle of wine (three cheers for Monday night dinners with lots of wine!) and anticipated the arrival of more delectable plates. While we waited, we marveled at the strangeness of the cutlery provided. The only way to balance your knife was blade up. That seemed...dangerous. Especially after the third glass of cabernet sauvignon.

Our next dish appeared and we dove right back in (carefully, so as not to cut ourselves on our upturned knives). A gorgeously-presented order from the Mozzarella Bar: bufala mozzarella with pear, rosemary oil, pine nuts that was drizzled with honey and placed on a crunchy, toasted slice of calabrese bread.

Next up was the Bangkok beef salad with peanuts, mint, mango, fried shallots and a sweet and sour dressing. There was a moment of hesitation while we all tried to dance around the fact that splitting this thing among the three of us might get violent. In the end however, we shared well (our kindergarten teachers would be so proud!). This wasn't an exceptionally complicated dish, but it was done to perfection: the beef was tender and pink; the mangoes were ripe and slippery; the shallots and peanuts added the crunch the dish needed; and the cilantro added the wonderful, bright note at the end. It should be noted that my friend said it was the third time she'd had this particular dish, and it was exactly the same every time. THAT is a sign of a great restaurant.

Our final round of food was to arrive, and we were practically giddy with excitement. We had decided on the Chinois duck with pickled cucumber, hoisin and sriracha sauce on a chive pancake, the curried shrimp with naan and the miso-glazed black cod with soba noodles and a ginger vinaigrette. We knew each dish would be good, but didn't know HOW good. We had spent the first half of the meal happily eating away and we were by no means disappointed with our choices. But these last three dishes absolutely blew them all out of the water. The duck was crispy and, I must say, substantial. The kitchen does not scrimp on the portions at all with this dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was a great compliment to the duck and the heat of the sriracha. A definite must-order at Origin.

Next up, we attacked the curried shrimp, which was intensely flavoured and perfectly spicy. The soft, aromatic naan bread sopped up the spicy broth that was left after devouring the plump, juicy shrimp. Another dish that hit its mark!

Finally (and kind of sadly), we came to our last dish: the black cod. Black cod is one my favourite fish and I have it a fair bit. When I was out in Vancouver earlier this year, I had it almost once a day. but this black cod might be the best I've had...ever. It was flaky, tender and moist. The miso glaze was pleasantly salty and the skin, most importantly, was nice and crispy. The soba noodles were served with the ginger vinaigrette and by the time we were done, there was literally nothing left on the plate. In all likelihood, the best dish of the night though the three of us never could decide on a clear winner in that category.

All in all, I would definitely recommend Origin to anyone who has some reasonably adventurous taste buds and who is willing to share. There is one composed plate that makes a meal - a burger combo with Spanish fries and a float. I have no doubt it's delicious, but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this. Go with friends, go on a date, go with family. It's not a cheap night out, but it is most definitely money well spent.

Alright, alright, so as it turns out I sometimes judge a book by its cover. Or, in this case, a bar by its' signage. Let's face it, I'm a sucker for good signage. And Souz Dal has it. The rusty globe hangs outside like a relic, the name of the bar cut into the side. Lit, and glowingfrom within, it reminds me of one of those tin punch-out crafts made from a (insert random legume) canat summer camp. But much cooler of course. It was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion, beckoning me in when I had somewhere else to be. Finally, one night a couple of weeks ago, I gave in to its sirens call. I was a little bit disappointed.

It was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender. I say lonely, butjudging by his charm (see: none) he probably liked it better thatway. Granted though, it was early - Souz Dal only has a drink menu - and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore on.

The stars I gave are attributed solelyto the bar's ambience. Dimly lit, and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy orMoorish feel to it. Worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls, while candles flicker on every table, casting shadows. The back patio has a similar vibe happening, cloistered in by high walls, andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottles.

Now I rarely turn down a good patio, but in this case I chose aseat inside, which says a lot.Reclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window, we watched College Street come alive as we perused the drink menu. I was in a cocktail mood, and my friend had read somewhere that Souz Dal claimed to have the "best" mojitos in the city, so that was the first order I placed. 

Now I've been to Cuba. I did a little backpacking, starting in Havanaand makingmy way to the South coast. I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur of the mojito because of this, but I diddrink my fair share, and like to think I know a thing or two about a good one. And this wasn't one of them. There wasn't nearly enough mint or sugar, so it was overwhelmingly bitter. I don't like my mojitos to taste like Kool-Aid, but I do like a little sweetness to curb the edge. 

Unlikely to order another of the same, but unwilling to give up on the bar, we tried a few other beverages. Nothing wowed us. The Moscow Mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn, but it also wasn't a repeat offender. The fortune cookie garnish on the lychee-infused Soho martini was fun, but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been. 

Although funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare Iwon't be returning to Souz Dal. If however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over. And if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on Mondays.

Away from the hubbub of the Annex and Little Korea, sushi joints become fewer and further between. On a relatively quiet stretch of Bloor West, between Dovercourt and Dufferin, sits Mazz Sushi.

An unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years, Mazz Sushi has been one of the few sushi options for Bloorcourt and Bloordale residents. Each time I visit, I am amazed by how bustling a place it is with the constant turning of tables and the rapid fire filling of take-out bags.

On a recent weeknight excursion, the small dining room was full, with a great mix of students, parents with young children and older couples; a typical audience for Mazz. Soon the servers were trying to accommodate extra guests and pointing out that it would be a '10 to 15 minute wait' for a table.

Seated, with menus in hand, the server soon appeared with the tea that was barely just ordered. Mazz's tea is very earthy in flavour with a hint of barley. Moving on quickly to another table, he left us to continue to ponder the menus, not returning for quite some time.

Upon his return, we quickly placed our order for various maki and sashimi hoping that the busyness of the place wouldn't slow the normally lightning-quick service.

After a moment, he returned with a bowl of congee and an amuse-bouche of marinated tofu. Don't be alarmed, these are Mazz's welcome dishes. I find the tofu pleasant enough, but the congee seems a little too heavy and porridge-like to start a meal.

Before these two were done, he was back again with the ubiquitous Miso soup and house salad. The soup was seasoned and flavourful with lots of nori and tofu. The salad was a small mixture of iceberg lettuce with some vegetable shavings and slices: by the book, but not out of this world.

Just as we were finishing our appetizers, the first of our rolls arrived. We ordered a Spicy Tuna maki: tuna mixed with crumbled tempura and hot sauce. My guest, not a fan of spicy food, likes Mazz's version, as she doesn't normally find it too spicy. Unfortunately this time they were a little too spicy for her. Good for me, but bad for her. A minor thing, but consistency means repeat business.

Next, the rest of our food arrived: a sashimi dinner and Dynamite roll. The sashimi dinner is always a joy at Mazz, and this time was no different. The plate usually contains a nice selection of tuna, white tuna, salmon and possibly mackerel, and always has more pieces then advertised. This time was no different, and the fish was very fresh. The only complaint, and I've found this happens quite regularly in Toronto, is that the white tuna was served too cold. The Dynamite roll was large, but a little tasteless; seemingly prepared in too much of a hurry, a couple of pieces unraveled and fell apart on the plate.

Overall, Mazz Sushi let us down a little on this visit. The staff seemed rushed and unable to provide the consistency that we have come to expect. Not once during our meal were we offered more tea, a slight unheard-of in a sushi restaurant. The food, although served quickly, wasn't up to their usual standards, and the wait to order was long. And although it remains quite inexpensive, the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system.

If you've ever driven by High Park on Bloor street, seen the street-level sign that advertises 3 dollar breakfast, and considered stopping in to check it out, you're probably lucky you didn't. Sure, I know the breakfast is only 3 dollars, so I probably shouldn't be hard on it; but regardless of price, I'd still like my meal to be served hot and be put together with some level of care and attention.

This is a pretty mediocre breakfast here: a slice of warm ham, a strip of old bacon, browned toast, over/undercooked eggs, leftover potatoes, breakfast served here is less-than-spectacular, and the service staff doesn't seem to care if you complain about it; I'm sure they've heard it all countless times before.

All of this, of course, is served in one Toronto's prized possessions, High Park. If it wasn't for the location, I certainly would have given them 1 star. In fact, it wasn't for the location, I probably wouldn't have eaten there at all. And in some strange way, I almost wish I didn't eat there. That way, the ad on Bloor street could have remained some mystical promise of a tasty, hot, and friendly-served breakfast somewhere in the heart of High Park.

Uncle Betty's is a family foodie heaven: the sole Toronto provider of New York's famous Dreesen's doughnuts, a colourful ice cream and dessert bar, warm and fuzzy comfort food, and a small selection of beer and wine for the grown-ups in the crowd, all make this a popular place for parents and kids alike. Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.

Offering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the "best ever," however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. 

For dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.

The service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the "gourmet" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. 

Most appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. 

Betty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.  We will definitely be back to Uncle Betty's to try some of the other great entrees on the menu, and  of course to dig into their ice cream bar.

I am the first to admit that I don't know Roncesvalles Village well. A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.

One such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the décor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.
My friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.

We submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a "Christmas burger" the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. 

Also sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. 

If you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. 
No matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!

By the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed.

Can I get a Whopper? Not anymore...

A former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.

Inside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...

This restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.

With that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.

Well to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.

A variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a soufflé of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.

One benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.

Quite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.

Food, like fashion, has a lot to do with trends. Every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere. Someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.

A number of years ago, it was the burrito, soon the poutine became chic.
Lately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best Southern-style barbeque.

On a recent Saturday night, I had the opportunity to eat at Lou Dawg's; Southern Sandwiches at King and Portland in the Entertainment District. Nestled in the basement, Lou Dawg's seems to be punching above its weight. It has a fairly small front of house, and on this night, a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up. And once they did, it was loud! Not only that, it wasn't even music. The sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall. Despite that, the place was buzzing. Pretty much all the tables were full and the young-ish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough, with tables full of plates and pints.

With our large order placed at the bar, we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table. No sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive. It was super quick, and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. My guests and I ordered the gamut of the menu: pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad, coleslaw and a 'Loutine' (poutine with pulled pork). Everything looked great...

The pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist, but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note; there wasn't that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque. The pulled chicken was very dry. This is a dish most people have difficulty doing well, and I don't think Lou Dawg's is any different. It seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile... waiting for someone to order it... The beef brisket was popping with flavour. It was succulent, with just the right amount of fattiness. If you're there, I highly recommend it.

Side dishes is where Lou Dawg's really shines. Their coleslaw is creamy, sweet and crisp, with dried cranberries and raisins. And the potato salad? Truly made with love. It burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed, and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture.

The small poutine was quite a large portion. The fries were as they should be: crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting. If the cheese was curds, you couldn't tell. They had lost all of their consistency from over heating. The chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled pork.

Overall, Lou Dawg's didn't live up to the hype. I've had better Southern barbeque at places that don't specialize in it, and way better at places that do. Coupled with that, the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself. Is it trying to be a restaurant? a sports bar? or a neighbourhood performance space? or just a hangout for friends of the staff? This indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place. So while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else.

The High Park neighbourhood is near-void of good places to grab a pint. Well, it was until The Mugshot Tavern opened anyways... The Mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void, and then some. Truly nice owners, delicious food, and a killer environment, this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what it's expected to be.

If the Mugshot doesn't have the best draft selection in a 10 km radius, it certainly has the most well-thought-out one. These guys obviously love beer, and more obviously is that they've put a ton of thought into what is being pulled from the taps. It's all craft beer, and some interesting stuff at that. Chances are they have a few you've never even heard of, like the King Pilsner and Warthog Ale. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that they're probably one of only a handful of places in the city with either on tap. Don't expect to find Canadian or Blue here; what they offer is much more creative than any of that stuff.

The food, and the entire menu for that matter, is equally well-thought out. It's a killer mix of Southern-soul and comfort food, and they do a dam fine job of pulling it off. You can expect to find Southern favorites, like fried chicken with fritters, and some not so expected ones, like in-house-made corn dogs with chutney. The presentation is pretty decent too and again, goes beyond the typical bar stuff. It's pretty obvious that the people manning the kitchen know what the hell they're doing back there. Rarely do I go to a restaurant and have difficulty deciding what to order; at The Mugshot I was torn between a few items.

They've done a dam good job of ridding the place of all remnants of the defunct McKenzies that used to take up the place. They've clearly spent a lot of time, thought, and energy turning it into something completely new. The environment, painted in bright red and tactfully covered in old-school, famous mugshot photos, is easily the kind of space you could hang out for a long, long time. It's comfortable and welcoming, the way a neighbourhood local should be. Despite not being an overly large place, it still accommodates nicely, and any excess people can spill onto their cozy rooftop patio.

And the staff at Mugshot? They couldn't be any friendlier. Having only been open about a week or so, you'd never know it by their attitudes. Likely working long hours, round-the-clock, getting the place ready and established, they're still sociable, out-going, and friendly. I sure-as-hell didn't feel like a stranger in this joint, and I don't think anyone with even the teeniest bit of personality would either. Even coming in by yourself is sure to get you some conversation.

It's clear that, after just opening, they're still trying to establish their crowd. It's still sorta random as to the people that might be in there. While one day the bar could be full of seniors, that evening it could be packed with a younger crowd. It seems to be dependent on the time of day, but it's also, unfortunately, the way the neighbourhood seems to work. Customers are sorta like family; you can't really pick 'em.

The Mugshot isn't just the kind of place you sit, drink, and hide from the world, although it provides that pretty well; it's also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space. In a neighbourhood like High Park, The Mugshot Tavern is unrivaled in every respect.

Located at the top of the restaurant strip on Roncesvalles, The Westerly is a cozy neighbourhood spot that is sure to please.  The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.

We spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.

After a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.

When the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.

Between the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.

Amazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.

I would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!

5 Doors North is my neighbourhood spot. I have visited it on several occasions, and each time I leave, I debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush. My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.

A spur of the moment, "Thursday night out" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.

The wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.

The appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese & roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli & lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.

For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.

The braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.

The prices are right, entrées run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will.

Bamburger is the latest entry into the inexpensive "gourmet burger" trend taking over Yonge Street, including Gourmet Burger Co., South Street Burger Co., Burger Shoppe and Gourmet Burger.

While Bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at Yonge and Davisville. Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed "diner" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.

Starting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.

The menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is "Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50)," and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!

We went with the "Bambamburger ($11.50)," which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the "Bambamburger," and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.

Bamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.

If you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.

One of the worst bar experiences I've ever had. The servers don't care if you're there, and they probably wouldn't care if you showed up at all. They're far too busy chatting with each other about how beautiful and amazing and important they are to care about customers. Avoid...

I know some people are going to completely disagree with my 1 star rating here, and to be honest, 10 years ago I would have thought the same; but considering how much the culture of Greek food on the Danforth has evolved in the past 10 years, Mr Greek seems to have been left far, far behind.

Mr Greek has slid to becoming nothing more than a glorified cafeteria. That might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though, because I've been to some cafeterias that aren't absolutely horrible.

I remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki, but what you're presented with now is nothing close to decent. The souvlaki is tough and tasteless, the rice is lukewarm and overcooked, the vegetables were likely previously frozen; bottom line is, this is in no way an accurate representation of what Greek food is in Toronto. Add in the sweaty, pushy serving staff, and you have an all around poor dining experience.

I actually complained via email last time I went, and I promptly received an email back from the owner full of profuse apologies and promises of a better meal, nicer service and an overall better experience if I returned. Although I appreciated his effort, the last thing I want is to be forced another meal there. I know restaurants can have a bad day, and I'm willing to overlook that. But from what I saw, this was just another day in the life of crappy restaurant living of it's achievements in the distant past.

On a street with as many options as the Danforth, there's absolutley no reason (or excuse!) to end up in this joint.

Since it opened, this place has become a West Toronto local favourite. And what's not to love? HUGE slices with fresh ingredients at reasonable prices. While I defintely have had better pizza before, for something quick, fairly inexpensive and reasonably tasty, there isn't much within walking distance that beats it. Just stay away at noon during the week, or the highschool crowd will eat you alive. 

If you can't make it in, they have delivery available too.

Having a craving for something spiced and exotic and motivated by a friend's comments that, "there is a good Indian place over on Queen," I ventured out in hopes of finding something deliciously curried. Upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on Queen West where a string of three of four Indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?

One thing I love about Toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building.  Little India stood out for it's well-organized, easy to understand and well-priced menu - in we went.

It is definitely an intimate spot, having no real capacity to hold very large groups, but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo. It was a cold Thursday night and not overly busy, so it did not feel crowded, and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentive.

The menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes. The price range is about $15 - $20 for an entrée, but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or Naan and which don't so that you can order them on the side.  First up was the mixed platter appetizer, which included samosas, onion bhajia, pakora and spring rolls. Everything was crispy, hot and just the right size for something before the entrée-and it came in at under $5.

For the main, I ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the Madras chicken.  Fair warning: if they tell you it's going to be hot, then it's truly hot.  We are all too accustomed to those Canadian-ized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses, and it is arguable that Little India may do this too, but in any case, take the servers' recommendations to heart.  I do enjoy some heat, but my taste buds can't handle extremes, so I steered clear on this occasion-except for a little taste of the Madras.  For those of you who do like spice, you'll love this!  It has that heat that creeps up after a few bites, not that punch-in-the-face-burn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Our server did lean my friend toward the less-spicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first, much to her dismay, but as it turns out his suggestion right on.  As for my tamer dish, it had more of a Mediterranean flavour to it; grilled, lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro.  It was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winter.

One of the greatest things about this restaurant is something I was not even able to take advantage of: the lunch buffet.  This is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, I say go for it!  Buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with.

Overall, I can't leave you saying it was the very best Indian cuisine I've ever had, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed, and I would go back again-especially for that buffet.

I heart churros.  At least that's what the button said that was given to me by the man behind the counter at Pancho's Bakery.  After noticing the small collection I have attached to both my bag and jacket, he was quick to give me a new addition.  I was hesitant to let it join the ranks, after all "I heart" anything is a pretty bold statement, and to be honest, as of that moment, I had never had a mind blowing churro experience, or at least one that would have me declaring such strong feelings for them.  The only time I ever ate a churro was at an establishment once promoted by a talking Chihuahua, so you can understand my hesitation.  I pocketed the button, as its fate would be determined later.

Pancho's Bakery makes up a portion of what is titled the Latin American Food Court in Kensington Market.  The tiny little storefront on Augusta Avenue is deceiving, as it houses more businesses than I would have guessed.  Assuming it was only Pancho's in the building, I was surprised (and excited) to see a stall selling tacos, another dealing in empanadas, and the infamous pop-up Agave y Aguacate.  Pancho's itself occupies the space right up front, across from the Korean dumpling stand... I'm not sure exactly how they fit in.  Apparently the Latin American Food Court doesn't discriminate, and why should they?  Dumplings are tasty, and well, I'm sure another vendor only helps pay the rent.

It was around twelve o'clock on a Friday when my friend and I decided to check out Pancho's. Neither of us had eaten, but we couldn't quite justify having churros for lunch. We are of the mindset however, that believes dinner shouldn't be the only meal followed by dessert, so our afternoon repast that day would have a churro chaser.

Full of carnitas tacos, and kimchi empanadas (Korean dumpling cart influence!), but not too full to pass up deep-fried dough, we made our way back to Pancho's.  I was promptly questioned as to the whereabouts of my button but I quickly placed my order as a distraction.

The churros at Pancho's are piped out in the front window, and brought to life for all too see, before quickly being led to their delicious demise in the deep fryer.  They are served hot, either plain or filled with your choice of chocolate, dulce de leche or strawberry syrup.  We ordered four, one of each flavour, and a plain.  At my servers recommendation I also grabbed some bread pudding and traditional Mexican concha bread.  As we had lost our seats (there aren't many to begin with) and the sun was shining, we took our treats to go.

We started with the chocolate, moved on to the dulce de leche, followed by the strawberry, and thus ended anticlimactically with the plain. They were crispy and sugar coated on the outside, while soft and (with the exception of the plain) accompanied with a burst of sweetness from within. Churro rookies be warned... a churro is a like a deep fried dough straw.  Any filling that goes in the top, will ultimately come out the bottom.  We left a sticky trail through the streets of Kensington that led back to Pancho's.  If Hansel and Gretel only knew about these, they would have rethought the breadcrumb idea.

Later at home, I popped the bread pudding and concha into the oven.  Concha is a sweet bread that resembles a clam shell, hence the name.  It tasted a little of brown sugar, but overall it was bland.  I think the idea however is to serve it alongside a cup of café con leche or hot chocolate and get to dunking.  I could see this working in its favour.

The bread pudding however (traditionally served around this time of year to be eaten for Lent) was delicious.  Dense, but very moist, and just sweet enough, my girlfriend went nuts over it. Apparently she doesn't have a problem with dessert after other meals either - and this time it was breakfast.

Now I'm not a fan of donuts, and the churro is essentially the donuts Spanish cousin, but I would take a Pancho's churro over a donut any day, and these are what I will return for.  As it turns out, I really do "heart" churros after all.  Now where did I put that button?

We were invited last week to attend a new menu tasting event at &Company Resto Bar in Mississauga (across from Square One Shopping Center).

First impressions were that this restaurant is HUGE. It's a good spot if you are looking to throw a large-group party or corporate event dinner. They definitely have room to accommodate large groups for dinner and drinks.

The menu is set up with shareable appetizers as well as traditional entrees. We tried a variety of starters, all which ranged from $13.50 to $16.50.

First, we tried the Louisiana Shrimp Po Boys. This sharable serving came with three Po boy sliders, along with a helping of fries. The shrimp were lightly spiced instead of battered like a traditional po'boy sandwich, and were served with creole tartar sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The buns were a bit oversized for the shrimp in the sandwiches. Something tells me they are better suited for the hamburger sliders also on the menu.

Next up for appetizers is the Charcuterie Flatbread. This was a great value! The flatbread that came to our table was the size of a small pizza. Each of us had a few pieces, which is a great size for an appetizer. As a big fan of a traditional charcuterie board I was interested in trying this out, and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was not overpowered by the cheese, tomato and sauce base on the flatbread. Would highly recommend this one!

Traditional entrees were next... I tried the Surf n Turf, a new menu item, which was $29. I really liked the unique presentation, which each item set up on a long board instead of a traditional steak and potatoes plate. The steak was cooked exactly as I requested. The lobster tail was a generous size, and the lemon-garlic butter sauce wasn't overpowering at all. It was cooked perfectly too and was very meaty.

Unfortunately, the double cheese baked potato was very dry. It seems like they are premade and had cheese, asparagus, and shallots added and reheated. A simply baked potato would have been a better choice for this one. The attempt at an added flair didn't add much to this dish.

Under recommendation from our waitress, we also tried the Penne Jambalaya. This huge helping of pasta came with big chunks of chorizo, chicken breast and shrimp, in a Sambucca Cajun cream sauce. The sauce tasted a lot like vodka sauce, for those who have never tried Sambucca before. The portion size was impressive, and the pasta had a good kick of spice to it too. Definitely a win, and at $19 it was well worth it.

Once 10pm hit, the music was turned up to a deafening level, and other tables of guests began to arrive, including a few party groups with bottle service for the night. We decided it was time to ask for dessert so we could head on our way. The Brownie Cookie Stack arrived at our table with fanfare. A huge firework candle drew the attention from the tables around us as it arrived. It would be great for a birthday party or function, but as a regular dessert accompaniment it was a little over the top. Again, we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size, a stack of 4 huge, thick brownie and chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry drizzle, all for $10. Although the presentation was amazing, the ice cream and sauce just couldn't bring out enough from the cookies, which were warm but weren't very moist or chewy.

Overall, the food is comparable to a lot of nightclub-restaurants on King Street in Toronto but at a more affordable price range, and without the 60-minute wait for a table. The service was great, from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant. &Company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday, family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening, this might not be the best choice.

Joy Bistro is a beautiful, sophisticated resto just inside Leslieville on Toronto's East side. It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.

First things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues, Joy Bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.

Brunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.

That, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.

They've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?

Despite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.

So lately I've been on a bit of an Italian kick. Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.
 
The camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. 

While (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). 

As for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  
  
Regardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. 

Our waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  

We started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. 
 
We chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.
 
No sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. 

Now when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.  Once again, as with the sharing, social norms seem to get in the way...

Torontonians have welcomed Momofuku with open arms and with satisfied stomachs. Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.

Three hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...

Momofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.

With the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.

As you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.

First we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!

Next came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!

We then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudité; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.

And then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.

Lastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,

We decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.

All in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?

Much like Ed Ho's recent earth Bloor West endeavour, Globe bistro's focus is on local and simple; myself, I find that to be a beautiful combination, if it's pulled off right that is.

Cut off from the cozy front bar space, you can't help but notice how welcoming Globe's dining room is; distinguishingly set tables, character hardwood floors, and an interesting play on shadows and lighting all come together to create a soft and intimate space. It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.

With considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.

Trouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...
There's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.

The West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.

The Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.

Much the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.
It's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.

Perhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.

For those that don't know, O.Noir is that unique place where you dine entirely in the dark. Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.

Seriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.

First off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.

I ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.

Speaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.

The seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.

Sitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.

Although we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.

On the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.

O.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...

Having grown up enjoying pubs far and wide, it doesn't take much to cajole me into visiting the newest local for a pint and bite to eat. This was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at Axis Gastropub on the corner of Bloor and Markham in Mirvish Village.

Axis sits in the old Rocco's Plum Tomato location and is the sister pub to Axis Gallery and Grill in the Junction. This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.

Arriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.

Within seconds we were greeted by the two servers/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.

Taking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.

Perusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.

At the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.

Overall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food. Maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but I can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.

Sometimes I ride the 501 streetcar just for something to do.  It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.

At first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.

My girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  

As it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham & cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.

The quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. 

Food however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.

Footnote:  Seating doubles in the warmer months, when it's comfortable enough to sit on the driftwood looking bench that runs the length of their storefront.  Another good place to do some people watching.

Utopia Cafe and Grill is aptly named. Let me tell you why... One hot and muggy Saturday evening, I found myself walking down College Street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst. Now, I'm notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options, and College Street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants. I passed by bistro after restaurant after lounge, growing hungrier by the minute. How did I choose? Divine intervention lent me a helping hand as the sky opened up and let loose a torrential downpour sending me running into the open arms (see: doorway) of Utopia.

It was already jam packed, which had nothing to do with the rain. There was a line-up for tables, but I managed to grab a seat at the bar to peruse both the menu and the environment. What is it about exposed brick and hardwood floors that make a place so cozy? Whatever it is, Utopia has both.

Needless to say, I was immediately enamoured, and when I opened the menu, that bubble remained intact. Now, I wouldn't call myself a vegetarian, nor would I dive into a steak with gusto, so for a selectavarian such as myself, I couldn't have designed a more heavenly menu if I tried. All but three of their appetizers are meat free, and they allow you to substitute soy (grilled or breaded & fried) for meat in most of their main dishes. Meat lovers and vegetarians unite!

And if that wasn't enough, it gets even better! I forgot to mention earlier that in between appreciating the exposed brick and opening the menu, I honed in on the beer selection (tunnel vision at its finest). And it made me smile, for they had KLB Raspberry Wheat on tap. Typically, I like my beer to taste like, well...beer, but I make an exception for KLB, especially in the summertime (although I find excuses to drink it at other points in the year) as the natural raspberry essence paired with the beer itself is possibly the most refreshing combination ever. Like angels dancing on my tongue...delicious, raspberry angels. Its difficult to find on tap, and Utopia has it, so I chalk them up some more points.

I started with the Mumahari Dip (roasted red peppers, pomegranate molasses and walnuts) that comes served with naan. While the dip itself wasn't exactly visually appealing (but really how many dips are?) with a likening to cat food, I was willing to overlook it. The Everlasting Gobstopper of dips, every bite of the Mumahari started sweet, moved onto nutty and finished with a bit of a kick. Delish.

Between the dip and the KLB, I was already very satisfied, but I wasn't done yet. Next came my Grilled Veggie & Goat Cheese Burrito. I love a good burrito, and this one didn't disappoint. Grilled zucchini, red peppers, eggplant, onions and a generous layer of goat cheese came wrapped in a soft tortilla. Served alongside substantial sides of both garden salad and rice, I couldn't finish it if I tried...and I tried. There is absolutely nothing wrong with leftovers though, and I can vouch that a Utopia burrito tastes just as delicious the day after.

On a tight budget? All of Utopia's mains hover around the $13 mark which in my opinion is a great deal considering the quality of the food and the very sizeable portions. I can easily see two people splitting a burrito and leaving the place with full stomachs (and wallets). The only problem with this scenario however, is the lack of leftovers.

If Utopia has any drawbacks, it's that the place is hot in the summer - really, really hot. The lack of air-conditioning combined with the open kitchen may have something to do with it. If I were anywhere else, I just may have been uncomfortable, but I had my pint of KLB, exposed brick, and a smiling bartender that made me feel like I was the only person in the room (okay...now I'm just getting carried away, but that being said the service is genuinely warm). Looking around, even though everyone had a sheen to them, nobody seemed to mind. Everybody just looked happy. People don't sweat at Utopia...they glow.

For a pasta-heavy neighbourhood, Utopia provides a nice deviation. It's the kind of place I could eat at everyday, so it's probably a good thing I don't live nearby, but it will definitely be my College Street go-to. They also have a four season patio (another good reason I don't live in the area, as much to my liver's chagrin, I have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outside).

Utopia is a contradiction unto itself: it's frenetic, but it's calm; blazers sit next to longboarders; meat lovers co-exist amongst vegetarians; it's hot, but oh so cool. As its name implies, this Bohemian spot in Little Italy is truly ideal.

Beautifully modern and discerning, Nota Bene provides the perfect setting for special occasions and casual dining alike. What makes the experience at Nota Bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous, and still attract a devoted clientele.

You might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity, and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary, all in the same place. The price is accessible, the quality of the food impeccable, and the service instant without being overwhelming.

We started the evening with Chef David's lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials. The lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell, with a chipotle cream, veggies and cilantro ($8). They tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city, and not at all heavy. The lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food.  The margaritas were phenomenal, served on the rocks with Avion tequila. We tried a couple of the cocktails and loved "Chef David's" traditional margarita with smoked sea salt. The blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage, but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered another.

For appetizers we started with the Hamachi ceviche, which is a yellowtail Pacific fish, infused with coriander, lime, avocado, and jalapeño ($16). This dish came highly recommended by our server, and was absolutely worth the hype. The jalapeños offered a very spicy take on the dish, tempered by the avocado and lime.

Next we tried the cavatelli pasta, with a truffle-scented mushroom Bolognese ($16). This dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it, and the truffle mushrooms were divine. We also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews ($15), and although I am self-admittedly duck averse, I am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful, and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companion.

For our mains we ordered two Nota Bene favourites. I went with the wild Digby sea scallops with avocado purée, Thai curry paste, mango, papaya and peanut salad ($28). For such a tropical sounding dish, the scallops actually had a very Canadian East coast feel to them, the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops. Nota Bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood, and I would absolutely come back for this dish again.

We also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle, pickled red onions, queso añejo and coriander ($29). The short ribs were tender, succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso añejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion, they were layered with flavour and flat out delicious.

With dinner, we ordered a glass of Ontario Pinot Noir and an Argentinean Malbec. The wine list at Nota Bene is extensive, with the full spectrum of bottles, ranging from the $70 to several hundred.

For dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding ($12) and S'More ice cream ($10). Needless to say, the sampling turned into finishing. Both desserts were exploding with flavour, the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream, taken with a strong espresso; this is dessert to die for. The S'More ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite, with a chocolate and graham cracker crumble.

Go try Nota Bene, twice.  Once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts. Service, quality and ambience are all top rate, yet you still feel the passion Nota Bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guests.

See you there...

Geez. I just cant figure it out. I've been looking through what other people have said about Megas, and it's all so bad...really bad. That's where the trouble comes in for me, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to. In fact, I actually thought I was going to be giving Megas more then 3 stars with this review. Why? This is the second time I've been to Megas. I was only going again because it was so good the first time. But the second time wasn't even a close second.

The big plus Megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the Danforth. It's probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street. It's a big, covered space that's chock full of people, and at first glance, is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day. 

Once you get over the patio though, and it comes to eating, you're likely to be disappointed; but it's completely dependent on what you order and when you order it. The food at Megas is mostly mediocre, but there are a couple things worth mentioning. While the rice is of the reheated, overcooked, slightly warmed kind, the Saganaki (fried Feta cheese made of sheep's milk) and Taramosalata (Cod caviar spread) is probably some of the best on The Danforth. Seriously, if you have never tried either of these, this is the place to do it. But everything else, order with caution. This place is completely hit or miss, mostly depending on how busy they are.

The inside is sorta your typical Greek place: fake roman statues, stone pillars, and lots of greenery; it's a big space too. If you check it out on the weekend, chances are that big space will have more than one big group, which Megas can provide for comfortably. But that's where most of their issues lie. While they may be able to provide for big groups, it's at the sacrifice of all the other tables. Once Megas gets busy, the service, food quality, and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floor.

Unfortunately, the one thing that is truly consistent at Megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation. While most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate, I don't blame Megas for that. After all, that's pretty much a standard for Greek food; it never seems to be about the presentation. When it comes to Greek food, there's never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table. You order calamari? It's probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil. You order hummus? It's probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone Kalmata olive. The only difference varying from place to place is whether it's tasty enough to be worth eating.

I'm still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not. I mean, they've got a few things going for them. Like I said, the first time was pretty good, and if I knew I was guaranteed that every time, I'd have no problems returning.  Megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking.

Once upon a time I was a university student.  Without giving you an exact number of how many years it's been, I will tell you that Gap wanted everyone in khakis, pagers weren't quite obsolete, and Mambo #5 was tearing up the charts.  So thankfully a lot has changed, but two things remain, and will always remain the same, about student life.  Number one:  students are broke.  Number two:  they are hungry.  Say Cheese is going to make many U of T students very happy. 

I haven't met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't like, and I haven't met anyone that doesn't like a grilled cheese sandwich.  That might be why so many gourmet grilled cheese places are popping up these days, but it's a risky business.  The people have spoken and they want grilled cheese sammies...but they don't want to pay a lot for them.  After all, you can make a perfectly good one at home with white bread, and cheese that's more plastic than it is dairy.  And that's where Say Cheese comes in.  Nigel Koo, part owner and operator wants to satisfy stomachs without putting a dent in wallets.  He doesn't see why he can't serve up a high quality sandwich at a low(ish) cost and have customers walking out in a lactose induced ecstasy.

It was quiet when I arrived but word wasn't really out yet, and the boys were still experimenting in their test kitchen.  I was happy to be a guinea pig.  I asked to try their most popular meat and veggie options, and this is what followed.  

I started with Indira's Pulled Pork made with Beemster.  Diners can choose to have regular cheese, such as cheddar, on their sandwich ($6.50) or upgrade to a premium choice ($8.50). My creation came topped with homemade mac & cheese (fun!) on whole wheat bread.  I only ate half as I had more coming my way, but the sandwiches here are generous, and I had to pace myself.  The different textures paired nicely, but I would have liked it more had the meat been a touch saucier, or came with something in which to dip it.

Next, came the Italian Classic.  Not that I'm taking bets, but if you put Buffalo mozzarella on anything, I will eat it.  So I was pleased when they said one of their best meatless sellers was filled with the stuff.  I like a good Margharita pizza, and this was the sandwich version.  

As if that wasn't enough (and by all dietary standards, it was more than that) I was offered their dessert sandwich.  It didn't take a lot of prodding, and went something like this;

 Nigel:  You should try our dessert option. 

 Me:  Wow, I don't know.  I'm really stuffed.  Okay.

The French Grilled Toast is like a ménage a trois between a grilled cheese, some French toast, and a piece of cheesecake. It's good.  Scary good.  Filled with ricotta, mascarpone and a berry compote, the sandwich is then dusted with turbinado sugar, and drizzled with maple syrup.  As with French toast, this needed to be eaten with a knife and fork, which probably worked in my best interest as it stopped me from inhaling it.  I will be going back for this one.  As it is now, I think about it more than anyone should think about a sandwich.

So in total I ended up eating just a little bit more than a full sandwich thanks to the few bites I had of the French toast, and I was beyond full.  So much so, that I actually skipped dinner that night. Now by my calculations, that equals two meals for the price of one, and a low price at that. This bodes well for hungry students up to their necks in debt.  

Footnote:  During the week, for a mere thirty minutes between 4:20 and 4:50 you can get yourself a sandwich and side (including soup, salad and possible ramen...) for just $4.20.

As I'm writing this, I already know a lot of people are going to disagree with me. After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.

Ok. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.

The brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.

The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.

The thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.

People rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.

Make no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.

So would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.

I'm a sucker for top-notch pizza. By top-notch, I mean pizza that is served sizzling and fresh and made with high-quality ingredients. Pizza like that is true craftsmanship; pizza like that I could eat every day. In my continuing effort to find superior pizza, I looked to Lil' Baci in Leslieville. My visit didn't disappoint me.

Lil' Baci's dining room is a decent-sized dining space, but the tables are packed pretty tight, so don't expect too much privacy. You'll likely hear everything that the table next to you is talking about. If you need to escape your neighbour table, in the warmer months you may want to check out the cute backyard patio. Comfortable, busy, and social, it's the place to be when the sun is out.

When I'm eating Italian food, I like to start off with a glass of red vino or cold Italian beer. Lil' Baci's wine list is small but thorough and their beer list offers some nice Italian choices; Moretti and Perroni are my personal favourites.

Lil' Baci has a seriously amazing dandelion greens salad.  If you've never had dandelions as food before, this would be the one to expose yourself to it. The greens are slightly bitter, but the bitterness works well topped with shaved Parmigiano, cracked black pepper, and freshly squeezed lemon. Perfect starter.

And the pizza, they do it right. Lil' Baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their Quattro Fromagi; my personal favorite.  They've got some other really outstanding pizzas to choose from like the Margherita (with tomato, basil, and mozza), the Lil' Baci (with pecorino, sausage, and fennel pollen), and the Gorgonzola Dolce (with gorgonzola, Yukon gold potatoes, and caramelized onions). All of their pizzas are served on signature thin crust dough that is seared and blistered perfectly.

Lil Baci has got a really small pasta menu. Ridiculously small. There's only three items. But still, these 3 items are done perfectly. They're all made with quality ingredients and use that great tomato sauce that's on the pizza. My favorite is just the plain ole' Spaghetti and meatballs.  It's got just the right amount of fresh basil, sauce, and Parmigiano. The portion size isn't huge, but with that dandelion salad and something from their Insalata menu, it's more than enough.

Lil' Baci also has a Panino menu, which surprisingly is different from their pizza menu. I love the Panino Tonnato. Packed with Italian tuna, caper aioli, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula, it's perfectly pressed into an amazing bite.

The dessert menu has a few options, but when I was there I had a lemon prosecco tart. The crust was buttery, but a tad on the dry side. The custard-like lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour, which balanced the acidity nicely.

I head to Lil' Baci when I want some decently priced Italian food and some amazing pizza. Lunch or dinner, what you end up with is a steal anywhere in the city!

I was here the other day for lunch and, as expected, there was a bit of a line.  That's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true. But waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood. When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits. 

When I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  

First off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.

Fruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.

Aunties and Uncles loses points in service. The service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the College & Bathurst area.

Meh. You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.

I'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. 

La Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.

But one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. 

Perfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.

On this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.

Seriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city.

The story goes, according to the Murray's Sandwich Emporium website, that Murray is a weiner dog who loves the finer things in life. Despite the obvious assumptions, Murray does not take kindly to eating regular old hot dogs. He prefers a more delectable, refined meal. What does Murray like the most? Sandwiches, of course! In fact, he loves them so much that he  used all of his love and expertise to build a sandwich shop for his fellow sandwich lovers. Thus, Murray's Sandwich Emporium sprang to life.

I recently found myself in the exact same conundrum as Murray the dog was; I was sick of my same-ol'-same-ol' packed lunches, and I was searching for something better. I know you're thinking that sandwiches have to be the most cliché lunch choice of them all, but one look at Murray's menu, and you'll know that you're in for something much different. 

There is not a huge selection (by sheer number) at Murray's, but each item is unique, and there is a decent range of combinations across the board. There are meatless, chicken, beef, fish, cheese and even sweet sandwiches, plus a decent offering of sides (note: combos and sides are extra). 

The restaurant itself is pretty simplistic. It's small, has exposed and undecorated brick walls and two large wooden tables with stools scattered around them. The chalkboard menu hangs on the wall, and there is a small refrigerator full of beverages just off to the side. It is all very subdued and quite appropriate for a sandwich shop.

I held back a bit on my first trip to Murray's. I didn't really know what to expect, how big the servings would be, and what kind of value I would find there. I decided to go with The Uncle Phil: sliced ribeye, onions, green peppers and ooey, gooey, messy, melty provolone cheese on a beautiful baguette. 

Truthfully, I thought the bread was the best part of this sandwich. I don't feel bad for discounting the meat or toppings because, for sandwiches at least, the bread is just as much a star in the meal as anything else. The baguette was clearly very fresh, they keep it tender (but crispy) and most importantly, not over or under-stuffed. The meat was tender too, but it needed a bit more oomph. The green peppers were just slightly sautéed, giving them a nice crunch and, as mentioned above, the cheese was gloriously gooey. All of that was topped off with a pickle - for nine bucks!

I felt that I didn't really get the whole experience of Murray's my first time around, so on my second visit I decided to get into some side dishes. I certainly didn't hold back on my sandwich choice with The BL-Tizzy - double smoked B, of course some L and T, house-made mayo, avocado and an egg (a $1.00 add-on). I threw all of that into a combo with some onion rings and a can of pop, bringing my total to $12 plus tax. This is a bit pricey in my opinion, but considering the amount of food they give you, it's not so bad. Here again, I thought the bread stood out more than anything else. It was so fresh and tasted of near perfection. Just like The Uncle Phil, the fillings were good but, other than the sheer volume, they were fairly regular...tasty, but regular.

Overall, Murray's Sandwich Emporium offers a delicious product that is definitely over-sized and that will satisfy your hunger. Plus, they're open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats. However, as tasty as the sandwiches are, I can't say anything really blew me away. Yes, the menu item names are unique and fun and the serving sizes are huge, but nothing is really over the top. That being said, sometimes simple is best; they know what they're good at, they know how to make a good sandwich, and they're consistent. 

Good boy, Murray.

I am in love...

How do I know? I paid $22 for a burger lunch and am absolutely ok with it.

Grindhouse is serious carnivore territory.

The first thing to stand out, though, was my drink. I went for my usual diet cola and I got, "Sorry we don't have anything with aspartame." In fact, you shouldn't go there expecting to get your go-to big brand soft drink at all. Well, well, well I better go for something really interesting then. Boylan's Birch Beer - a root beer drink, sweetened with cane sugar, with pure vanilla extract and only one preservative (sodium benzoate, typically used in soft drinks and other acidic preserves). Their amazing dedication to fresh and natural ingredients obviously did not end there.

All of the ingredients are local and fresh, the burger meat comes from naturally raised livestock and is Genetically Modified Organism, hormone and antibiotic-free. You will not find anything that has refined sugars, or artificial sweeteners (hence the lack of Coca-Cola and Pepsi on the premises). They literally prepare everything in-house. The buns are made there and they also make the ketchup and mustard themselves, right in the back kitchen. The "fresh and never frozen" attitude is not good enough here; if you're going to do it, do it right.

Their burger creations are unique and creative; a turkey burger with black truffles and cranberries, yes they do have a veggie burger and it's soy-free and, my choice, the black and blue burger are just a few of the menu items. I was presented with a Cajun spiced beef patty smothered in blue cheese sauce and cooked only to medium, with a side of onion rings (who was I kidding with that diet cola anyway).

If you can be sure of the meat quality, requesting a burger cooked less than well-done will give you much more flavour and a better texture. On my first bite there was an immediate rush of barbecue charcoal flavour emanating from the patty; it tasted like summertime. The blue cheese sauce was mild and, considering the Cajun description, it was spiced, not spicy. The onion rings were huge and somehow satisfyingly greasy but unbelievably crispy.

I actually don't often talk about presentation because, frankly, it's all about the taste for me. I have eaten enough beautiful yet disappointing and ugly yet amazing dishes to spend much time considering plating. However, the simple beauty of this burger and onion rings dish was lovely - just a white plate and a burger, without a toothpicked-pickle piercing the bun. Lovely.

Much like my University professors, I hesitate to give out a "perfect" score and I can't on good conscious say that this was the very best burger in the city, but - a big but - they gave me something pretty darn close to the best burger around and the attention paid to good, fresh and healthful ingredients truly impressed me.

Their name might be harsh and gory, but you'll find burger-fare inside that is gentle and kind to you and your body.

If you are on your way to go shopping at Bayview Village, and you need to stop for a quick bite, look no further than Aux Delices Café.

Situated at the main entrance of Bayview, now in its third year of business at the mall, and judging by the patrons that came through in our lengthy Saturday afternoon visit, this place is a hit with the locals. Being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, Aux Delices caters to their clientele. Health conscious foodies will delight in their selection of fresh, gourmet ingredients, including Panini's, pastas, crepes, salads, and even specialties like duck l'orange and homemade gelato, just to name a few. There menu is ever changing, depending on seasonal availability, so there is always something new to try at Aux Delices.

We started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti, but would be great as an entrée on its own.

The duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own. I would have returned just to try a sampling of all their fresh veggie salads.

Next up, a roasted vegetable Panini, recommended by our host. The yellow pepper, red onion and eggplant were soft and easy to eat, with a nice portion of goat cheese on lovely focaccia bread. Moving into crepe territory, we decided to tackle the ham and cheese crepe ($9.50), with tomatoes as well, and would go back for more. Their crepes are light and fluffy, and packed with ingredients. Even better, your crepe is made right in front of you, and you can add any ingredients you like. A fun experience for kids, too.

For those looking for the "café" experience, they serve up delightful illy coffee, and Rahier desserts, that almost make you feel like you are dining in Europe. Their double espressos were great, nice and bold, and the latte was perfect, frothy and steamed to perfection. The homemade gelato was amazing. I love ice cream, and have been a latecomer to the gelato trend, but I am glad that I tried it. We sampled the chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, a must when having gelato, and they were all very well done. The vanilla and chocolate especially, both true to their flavours, with a natural, nuttier taste, rather than overtly sweet.

Aux Delices Café offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry. All of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal.
Gourmet meals ready as soon as you order, great coffee and homemade gelato should have you stopping for a break on your next shopping trip.

Cupcakes have reached a point of utmost popularity in the world of baked goods. Why are people flocking to these brightly coloured, frosted, palm-sized desserts? Well, I'm sure there is some greater social commentary to be made here about a reversion to childhood or a need for comfort foods in our over-stressed, over-worked lives, but, in the case of Prairie Girl Bakery, it's just simply that they taste so darn good!

Walking into Prairie Girl Bakery is almost like entering a fine clothing store - everything is placed just so. The whole space is pristinely clean and clear of clutter; literally nothing exists except a counter and back-wall display. The cupcakes are kept safely behind the employees, lined up row by row waiting to be selected and boxed up. All of the focus is on their one and only product. There is no time wasted on brewing coffee, serving tea, or making sandwiches. Everything comes down to one thing: the cake and the icing.

When I first walked into the store, I thought I made a mistake. I went in to grab a dozen cupcakes for a work function and was shocked at the lack of merchandise on the shelves. I had to ask, "was I supposed to pre-order before coming in?" Not at all. They just take extra care to provide the freshest product possible, promising never to serve a "day-old cupcake." So, baking in big batches to keep the shelves stocked to the brim all day is out of the question. The team at Prairie Girl Bakery prides itself on being resourceful and limiting waste; they even take any leftover cupcakes to a local charitable organization, Toronto's Second Harvest, that is dedicated to providing realistic solutions to hunger. Are cupcakes a necessity for a charitable food organization? Of course not, but why not give where you can and provide something a bit more luxurious than canned food to those in need.

The cupcakes come in two sizes, 13 flavours, and an array of beautiful colours. You won't find any unneeded extras here, like (in)edible sugar flower toppings disguising an otherwise delectable treat. The cakes are simple and the swirls of icing are in the spotlight on top of light bases. The range of flavours include peanut butter banana, red velvet with classic cream cheese icing, chocolate-chocolate, chocolate-vanilla, chocolate-hazelnut, chocolate cake with peppermint icing, and my ultimate favourite, chocolate cake with strawberry icing. The strawberry colour was fairly mute, but the flavour was intense. Even more impressive was that the chocolate cake didn't overpower the icing or vice versa. Each deep flavour perfectly complemented the other.

A dozen mini-cupcakes come in at $18.95 and one dozen regular size at $31.95. My gluttonous side will only order the mini cupcakes from now on, allowing me to eat two or three different flavours in one sitting. However, there is something supremely gorgeous about the sight of one of their regular sized cupcakes sitting in it's very own container (complete with viewing window) waiting only for you.

Want to feel a little less guilty about completely indulging in these sinfully tasty treats? Prairie Girl Bakery's dedication to remaining as all-natural as possible streams throughout the whole operation. Not only do they use recyclable cardboard packaging, but they are absolutely free of preservatives, artificial flavours, and hydrogenated or "trans" fats. I'd say that's mostly healthy eating.

On one final note, I have to say that I love the mythology around this place. The story is that Prairie Girl Bakery's creator, Jean Blacklock, learned all she knew from her family back on her Saskatchewan farm. She eventually left a career in law to bring that down home prairie, old fashioned baking to us city-dwellers. I don't think there could possibly be more charm or more beauty in the simplicity of what Prairie Girl Bakery is and what they produce.

Coquine Restaurant serves up an excellent weekend brunch, with all the charm and flavour of a European patio café. The restaurant is decked out art-deco style, with lots of white tile, dark wood and vintage posters lining the walls. Coquine boasts several large dining rooms and a quaint patio, perfect for people watching or a leisurely meal. A large group of us descended on Coquine one Sunday morning for a late brunch, and found the menu to be both classic and eclectic. Let me explain. .

Traditional Sunday morning brunch normally sees a line-up of the usuals; pancakes, omelets and waffles. While Coquine serves up all of these items, they do it all with a pronounced French flavour, not afraid of adding a little gourmet to your breakfast.  Coquine's wonderful Apple Jack's ($11) offers up a stack of fluffy pancakes, topped with delectable caramelized apple and maple syrup. The delightful Vanilla French Toast ($12) is flavoured with fresh vanilla bean and served with a berry compote and Chambord. The Steak Frites ($19) were delicious, and came with a side of Parmesan truffle fries and mayo. While you may not be able to fly to Paris for weekend brunch, you can certainly enjoy the savoury French-style cuisine just south of Yonge and Eglinton.

Everyone found their meals to be excellent, and I can personally attest to both the quality and quantity of the wild mushroom and shallot Quiche with chévre ($14). Coffee (and Bailey's) was always available, and attentive extras like water for the group, and non-stop breadbaskets make the service at Coquine both pleasant and under-stated.

Overall, the value for meals was very good, as portions were large, and fit for sharing. Both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive, but never obvious. With an excellent location between Davisville and Eglinton subway stops, and great food and service, Coquine should be on your list as a must-try for weekend brunch.

If the word 'bulk' conjers up images of dusty old ethnic shop food bins or soulless Bulk Barns, then you need to check out Nuthouse for a second opinion. Sitting in a little space out in the Bloor and Lansdowne, Nuthouse has established itself with Blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting products.

First thing you'll notice about Nuthouse is that it smells good...it smells really good...it smells like an incredibly nice mix of high-quality nuts, cereals, grains, teas, dried fruit, lentils, dried fruit, spices, cake, and coffee. It's a smell that right away makes you feel comfortable and assures you that what you're getting is filled with quality. Don't expect to see the typical bulk fare with hundreds of bins full of overly processed and mass-produced stuff; you're in the wrong place for that sorta thing. Nuthouse is full of nothing but always high quality and sometimes organic products.

Ok. That might not be the very first thing you notice. Chances are, if you're walking down Bloor looking for this place, or even if you're not looking for it, the first thing you'll notice won't even be inside the store; it'll be the big, plastic walnut hanging above the front doorway. That big walnut has become somewhat of a landmark item on this stretch of Bloor, even though they've only been in business for a few months.

Nuthouse isn't just about nuts. They carry all sorts of things, from organic candy and fair-trade coffee to raw cereals and handmade soap. And its healthy too. A lot of the stuff they carry is the sugar-free, vegan, raw, organic type of stuff, which makes it a super option for more health conscious people. And if you have dietary restrictions, Nuthouse has got you covered too with tons of gluten and wheat free products, like their spiced carrot cake. If that's your bag and you live in the area, you no longer need to travel far to get these kinda things.

Personally, when I think of organic or locally-sourced or handmade or any other related adjective used to describe stuff in a store like this, I unfortunately also think 'expensive'. At Nuthouse though, that really isn't the case. The prices are actually fairly down-to-earth and mostly afforable. In fact, a lot of the products they sell are actually cheaper than the bulk stuff you find at No Frills, with an obvious element of quality you may not find at bigger places. 

Wanting to try out interesting varieties of stuff you already love, like lentils or rice or yes, even nuts? Nuthouse has got you covered. They carry a ton of different kinds, some of which you probably didn't even know existed. And that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this: you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something. Buying in bulk doesn't have to be about being able to get more for less, it's about being able to also get, well, just less. The fact that Nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake.

Walk in to Famoso's new Annex location and there is no mistaking the kind of restaurant you have entered: a popular, loud hang out for students, families and friends alike. It's a casual place with daily deals (movies, cheap wine on Wednesdays, etc.), TVs showing Blue Jays' games and young staff working feverishly to keep up with the sit-in and take-out clientele.  It's got a pleasant, relaxed vibe and people seemed to be rather enjoying themselves.

Once seated in our booth, we perused the menu and our lovely server explained how the restaurant works: you write down your order on the notepad provided, bring it up to the counter and hand it in. You can either pay right away or begin a tab. Any subsequent orders can be placed through the wait staff. I assume this method is effective for those in a hurry, but it did seem a little odd considering how often our server checked in on us. She also expounded upon the "red sauce" pizzas made with Campania tomato sauce, fior-de-latte mozzarella, basil and pecorino romano cheese. (The "white sauce"pizzas are made with a garlic and olive oil sauce instead of the tomatoes.)

We opted for the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer, the funghi tartufo and San Andreas pizzas and, for dessert, the dolce and banana dish. As with any self-respecting pizza place, they had San Pellegrino on the menu so got an Aranciata (my fave) and a Limonata. My dining companion kindly took the order the counter while I scoped out the huge place before me. Famoso has really nice exposed brick walls, comfortable booths and, by my count, at least three staff members per table. There are a lot of eyes on tables and not much gets missed. The staff is universally nice, if perhaps inexperienced. It lacked a certain finesse, but made up for it in sweet charm.

Our appetizer arrived and I'm glad we asked for salt, pepper and chili flakes. The mozzarella balls were tasty, but the red sauce (which would appear later on our funghi pizza) was very, very sweet. For my liking, too sweet.  A dash of salt and some chili flakes were necessary and helped considerably. I was hoping for crispier prosciutto, too; as a start to the meal, it was pretty average. If you're going to get an appetizer, I would recommend you try a salad. They looked fresh and tasty.

Our funghi  tartufo pizza arrived fairly shortly afterward. It consisted of roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, truffle oil and parmiggiano reggiano.  Again, it was better with the salt and chili flakes.  The crusts at Famoso are a bit thicker than is the trend right now, but I liked the chewier texture. I only wish that this pizza had been left in the 900-degree oven a little longer as it needed a little more crispiness to counter the soft, melting cheese that was starting to soak through the crust. (A note: I took a slice of this one home and had it two days later. I have to say, it tasted much better as a leftover!)

Our second pizza - the San Andreas - was a "New World Pizza" with a white sauce, chili-lime marinated chicken and fresh mozzarella. It was then baked and topped with avocado slices, diced roma tomatoes, onion, cilantro, a drizzle of cream and a lime wedge. Certainly not traditional, but pretty darned tasty. The pizza seemed to have stayed in the oven just that little bit longer and had that nice char on the bottom. The lime juice provided a bright flavour and the chicken was tender. (I'd have liked a little more chicken, but that's a bit of a nitpick. It was a good pizza.) Were I to go back, I would steer my companions toward it if they wanted to try something a little different.

Finally, dessert. This was my favourite dish of the four we tried. A long, rectangular plate of roasted bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar, topped with pecans and caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream in the middle arrived at the table and my eyes widened. This looked and smelled fantasti and tasted even better. The bananas were piping hot and creamy and contrasted beautifully with the crunch of the sugar and the chill of the ice cream. That dish was devoured in what had to be record time.

Overall, Famoso is...fine. There isn`t anything in particular that stands out but there isn't anything egregiously wrong with it, either.  It caters to a wide variety of tastes so it is sure to be a good option if you are going out with a group with varying tastes or dietary restrictions or preferences. Do not bother with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls, but do not skip dessert.

La Passione is a dimly lit and intimately decorated restaurant on Yonge, just south of St. Clair, where you can get your fill of any and all your Italian favourites and a (huge) glass of wine.
Their extensive menu holds everything from Calamari Fritti, Insalata Arugula, Papparedelle al Salmone and Penna alla Vodka to Gnocchi with a choice of four sauces, Pollo alla Jolly (chicken in rose sauce) and Margherita pizza (a simple delight of mozzarella, olive oil and oregano).

La Passione balances the traditional with some modern comforts; you can peruse the thorough and interactive website and check out their Facebook page, then go and grab a classic white-clothed, candle-lit table and dip your focaccia in olive oil and balsamic before ordering gluten-free or whole wheat pasta.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting and, as I found out while waiting for my dinner guests who were running late, it is a very comfortable space to sit and relax with a glass of red.

From start to finish, it was delightful. For such a moderately-priced Italian restaurant, they surely hold their own.

I was ecstatic to find that my penne side dish with the Pollo alla Fiorentina - chicken sautéed with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes in smooth and rich cream sauce - could be replaced with tender gnocchi. I truly could eat pasta every day, but gnocchi is my new favourite indulgence. I'm on the hunt for the best in the city and will devour any potato pasta nugget that comes my way in the process.

The veal Marsala entree is adorned with tons of sautéed mushrooms, the vegetables were cut large and almost put the roasted potatoes to shame; it was true Italian comfort food.
And as for the Papparedelle al Salmone, the wide threads of pasta are covered all over with a pink Salmon-infused cream sauce. Rich and smooth, this was definitely the star of our table.

Personally, I can't go to an Italian restaurant that has Tartufo on the menu and not order it - no matter how full dinner has left me. A few flavours are offered, but I finally landed on Tartufo Royale, a tart and sweet pairing of raspberry and chocolate ice creams covered in cocoa and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I also happened to snag a scoop of pistachio gelato, but it didn't hold a candle to the aforementioned chocolate indulgence.

La Passione was a nice surprise, with entrees coming in around $15-$20 and a wide-range of choices on the menu, it is sure to satisfy. They also occasionally post deals on Groupon - it makes for the perfect opportunity to get out and try something new.

La Revolucion is amazing! Well no, it isn't, but that's exactly how I wanted to start this off. Man, I really wanted to love this place. La Revolucion just looks so dam cool, that I figured the whole experience was going to be amazing. When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.

La Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.

They're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.

Presentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.

Interestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is. La Revolucion may be a restaurant, but a revolution it is not.

The Rotisserie House is a family-run, Portuguese barbeque (or Churrasqueira) restaurant in the Liberty Village area. Like most places owned and run by families, this restaurant is small, a bit cluttered with a mishmash of décor and, no matter the number of other patrons there at the time, has a staff that makes you feel like the centre of attention.

They happen to be closed on the weekend, but from Monday to Thursday they are open from 11:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Fridays from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. The hours are slightly odd, but it makes for a great lunch spot, especially for those like me who tend to take lunch anytime between about noon and 3:00 p.m.

They offer a variety of chicken dishes, a number of different sides and even one vegetarian option. You can get a 1/4 or 1/2 rotisserie chicken dinner - white meat or dark meat - with a choice of two small sides for $6.50 - $10.00. For an additional $0.99 (small) or $1.98 (double) you can get a side of onion rings, Greek or Caesar salad.

The menu itself is pretty huge and is filled with quite a few options. The regular roster of sides, for example, includes Portuguese rice, roasted Parisian potatoes, steamed vegetables, French fries, garden salad or potato wedges. Mains include the abovementioned chicken combos, rib combos, a variety of salads and soups, chicken wings and fingers and sandwiches, like pulled chicken, grilled vegetable, grilled chicken, pork or sausage. They even offer catering.

I decided upon the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of Parisian potatoes. The pulled chicken is topped with their "famous" hot sauce, served on a white or whole wheat Kaiser and is dressed with mayo, lettuce and tomato. All of this, with a drink, came in at about $9.

One of my all-time favourite side dishes are those lemony, roasted potatoes available at most Greek restaurants. Well, The Rotisserie House's Parisian roasted potatoes are a close second. They are red, probably from Paprika, and just a bit fiery from the restaurant's signature hot sauce. The pulled chicken sandwich was flavourful, tender and also had the same red hue from the sauce.

I do enjoy spicy foods, though I am a bit of a wimp. This restaurant's hot sauce had a great kick and a good flavour, but it won't burn your mouth to the point that you can't taste anything else. This is really important, since they throw the hot sauce on their dishes, whether it's requested or not. Don't fret too much about all the spice if you're grabbing lunch and heading back to the office, you can buy a pack of gum here too!

Considering the size of this restaurant, I was quite surprised by the number of items they have on the menu. It was not overly busy when I walked in, so everything went very smoothly as far as timing and service went. The staff is extremely friendly, but very small, so I am curious to see what happens when it gets really busy. However, they seem to have it all figured out.

If I lived closer to Liberty Village, I could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch, or to grab some dinner on the way home from work. The prices are reasonable, the food tastes good and it's quick and satisfying.

The most common praise of Dark Horse is its patio; the most common complaint about Dark Horse is its lack of service on the patio...

If you've been to Bloor West Village, you know that there aren't a lot of patios in the neighbourhood, and any patio that you do find is likely going to be small, cramped, and full of people. With the exception of the Firkin on Runnymede, Dark Horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints, people watch or eat burgers and fries.

But, as many people have pointed out before me, the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when you're sitting out there. While you're waiting, you may even be waiting so long for service that you'll feel compelled to go inside and get your own drinks, which causes the server to give you attitude when she eventually gets to your table, which causes you to feel uncomfortable; you see the vicious circle taking shape here...

All-in-all, the food at Dark Horse isn't half bad. Granted, they aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but for pub food that goes well with a few drinks, it's pretty decent. While some of the food, like the calamari and nachos, is previously frozen and highly unimaginative, other items, like their Village Burger or fish and chips, are clearly made in-house and truly tasty. They also serve a weekend brunch that is worth checking out, but expect to wait for a table; it fills up quickly with the neighbourhood locals.

All of the expected draft options are here...I think. Truth-be-told, the server never actually rattled off the draft list to us in the limited time she spent at our table. Luckily, there were a few beer-branded signs in the patio, which makes the process a little easier, but a lot less convenient.

Dark Horse's problems are easily fixable; they just need a bit more staff. Trust me, sit back on the patio, have a pint, and watch them work. It'll quickly become obvious that they're understaffed. Another server or two during their busier times, and Dark Horse could be fantastic.

Truth be told, it's just a pub, and a fairly average one at that. If you're in a hurry, you may want to avoid this place, but if you've got some time to kill and want to soak up some sun on a patio, Dark Horse provides nicely.

Located in the Annex, in the middle of Mirvish Village, The Central is a bar, a restaurant, and a live music venue.  The dimly lit house-turned-restaurant with the splendidly seamy vibe immediately and completely tugged at my heart strings.  I loved the rickety setting and little details like the "Draught: Use Your Eyes" sign behind the bar.

But, as with any new love, first impressions can often deceive you; The Central played with my emotions.  The menu - and be warned the online menu is not what you will find when you arrive there - has so much potential and I very much wanted the food to live up to my expectations.  My party of three shared grilled calamari with side of salad greens in a light citrus dressing, followed by entrees of grilled mushroom salad with shrimp, a grilled vegetable sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a cheesesteak sandwich with Tom Yum soup, all of which (with three beers) came in at just over $60.

The menu items are not very risky, but still need to be done carefully to be successful.  As much as I wanted everything to come out perfectly, it simply did not.  First of all, the calamari was a very large serving - so far, so good.  But, in grilling it whole, the tips became overcooked and the centre remained undercooked, and there was a hint of burnt charcoal flavour.  The grilled vegetables were also overcooked, producing an all-over brown hue, making them completely lose their individuality.  The cheesesteak had the right flavour, but again, the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy.  Finally, after looking forward to trying one of the desserts in hopes for menu-redemption, like the candied strawberries or the ever-infamous deep fried Mars bars, we were told that all they had available was ice cream.  Not so impressive.

While the main dishes and lack of desserts were disappointing, I do have to commend them on a couple of things.  All of the side dishes were on-point; the dressing on both the calamari dish, and the mushroom salad were light, flavourful and had a good citrus tang; the sweet potato fries were crispy, and came with a side of a creamy cinnamon dip that was a great alternative to regular ketchup; and the Tom Yum soup was hot, spicy, and a great choice for a chilly December night.

I have decided that The Central could very well become a favourite spot of mine for drinks, and maybe appetizers, but is just not an ideal choice for a full dinner.  The venue itself is one that you should check out, and I expect it is only better when the patio is open in the summer.  If you don't want to sit in the main bar to listen to the band they have a cozy lounge space upstairs that can be rented for private parties.  Also, they clearly take pride in the beverage menu, especially the beer choices.  When we had some trouble deciding on a pint, we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called Netherworld, a Flying Monkey brew, which is similar to the popular Mill St. Tankhouse Ale.

I give them an A+ for atmosphere, but only a gold star-for-effort on the menu.

Wanting to try something new, and looking for a cool place to go for pre-Yuk-Yuks dinner and drinks, my friend and I decided to try out Everest Restaurant on Queen West.

What seemed to be a quiet Saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm, quickly turned into a fairly busy "club" like dining experience. And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.

I was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new "go-to" place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox, maybe, but sit we did!
Putting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.

The dinner menu ($15-$20) presents a somewhat more challenging predicament. Filled with Tibetan and Indian dishes, along side the same old North American stand-by of pasta and sandwiches, I found myself unsure if this was a Tibetan restaurant, or your average Italian eatery all dressed up. It's not that I mind an eclectic menu, in fact I appreciate one, however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine (in this case, Tibetan), one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft, and have their "specialty cuisine" down pat. Thus, I was unsure of whether venturing into the momas (Tibetan dumplings) and sha-momo (spinach and beef), or the fettuccine alfredo was the better option.

After some quality deliberation between the Tibet/North America paradox, I decided to try a platter, a mix of several different Tibetan style foods, to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible. The menu seemed heavy on potatoes, stewed meats and rice, so I decided to try almost all of the above. The stewed potatoes were good, cooked just right, but tasted much like something I could make at home, no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like I was trying something exotic. The rice was cooked with raisins, which just didn't do it for me, and was a little bland.  My meal was served with steamed Tibetan vegetables (broccoli and carrots), which aside from not seeming exceptionally Tibetan to me, were surprisingly good. An interesting side note, both of our meals were served with naan bread, which really was just pita bread from my estimation. Overall, I was fairly underwhelmed by my choice. My friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread (same problem), and said that she enjoyed her meal. The butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving Indian food. 

While I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design décor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try "Little Tibet" further down Queen Street.

Despite it's seemingly religious name, this Blansdowne cafe has nothing to do religion. It's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe. You know the type of place I'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, Value Village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling. It sorta looks like one day someone decided: 'Well, we have a stove. Why don't we open a restaurant?' It seems random, but truthfully, it doesn't matter all that much. If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.

There really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.

The menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.

I've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening. Maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook, but they guy working never mentioned it to me when I asked him about the food or the limited menu.

I went during the week for lunch, and this little place was pretty packed. Mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops. It seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing, because there really isn't much else in the neighborhood that offers it. It's cozy and comfortable, and I could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee, comfortably typing away.

Holy Cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up WiFi and get a decent cup of coffee, Holy Oak can definitely provide. But it doesn't offer much more than that.

Sharkey's is no more! And thank God for that. I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.

So, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...

A few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.

The Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.

The Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.
Working with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.

One other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.

Keep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.

As a group of new Toronto recruits, we decided to try out Rebel House at the suggestion of one of my coworkers. An easy walk from the Rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the Stanley Cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.

The Rebel House is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat. Several TV's aired the hockey game, and there was an eclectic mix of people, some older, into their 50's, but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and students.

The menu is varied, but small, although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability, which is always a good bet.

My dining partner decided to go with the daily special Mussels ($14), absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce, with toasted garlic bread. I ordered the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies ($10), small appetizer-sized cheese patties, with nary a spinach leaf in sight...nor were they spicey. No matter. These delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with. At our server's suggestions, I also ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad ($6), with cheddar cheese, toasted almonds, and a homemade maple dressing on the side. A wonderful combination. In fact, we liked the cheese pennies so much, we ordered another batch, only to find that that a repeat order isn't always as good the second time around. These pennies were so thick with grease, I found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down. I think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good, but for now I choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies; delightful.

My dining partner, an "adventurous" drinker himself, ordered a Labatt Blue, but it did come in the extra large bottle, which made him smile from ear to ear. I ordered the Henry of Pelham Pinot Noir to start, but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak. Not to be discouraged, I tried the 2006 Cabernet Franc Special Reserve VQA after dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine I have had at a pub in some time. It had a heavy quality, with a nice vanilla finish. I would go back to Rebel House just to try this glass of wine again.

Our server was friendly and talkative, and the prices at Rebel House are fairly reasonable. Wine was about $7-$8 a glass, and our meals were between $8-$12 for the appetizers, and up to $20 for an entrée. Except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies, Rebel House is an excellent neighbourhood pub, serving up good food at good prices.

I came to Ultimate Café by accident. In a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of Hey Lucy, I was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini Wednesday at that popular King West spot. Enter stage-right, Ultimate Café (a bit of Entertainment District fun for you there). Whether coincidentally or strategically, they also offer their own cheap martini Wednesday - how clever. 

Their menu is fairly standard, including soups, nachos, sandwiches and Paninis, pastas and salads and they say the ingredients are bought fresh daily from Kensington Market.

After my first meal, I decided to do some reading and collect the thoughts from others before making my final decision on Ultimate. The reviews are mixed, and I have to agree with that sentiment.

I've now been to Ultimate twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The night of the martinis, I decided to make a meal of appetizers - a favourite thing to do. I had the spring rolls and the sweet potato and lemongrass soup. I wasn't disappointed in the least; the spring rolls were crunchy and hot and the soup, though a tad too sweet for my own taste (always a risk for sweet potato dishes), was flavourful, thick and rich. It was a satisfying meal but, much like the menu, was basic stuff.

Then, I went back for lunch. 

We started with the nachos which turned out to be a delight. They look completely unimpressive, but once you dive in you'll realize that there is just the right amount of melted cheese, neither scorched or soggy, and it's topped lightly with chopped lettuce, tomato, olives and jalapeno. I have come across some online grumbles about the portion sizes, but any more and it would have proven far too big for a two-person starter or a one-person meal. My entrée was the Montreal smoked meat Panini with a side salad. The Panini was my favourite dish there by far. The meat was warm and tender and, again, was not over-sized. The sandwich was obviously freshly pressed and there was a tangy mustard spread topping it off. But, here's the rub - the salad was small and the leaves were wilted, which is a common complaint across the boards about their greens and the dressing could not possibly have been made in-house. It maybe could have passed for garnish. A really top-notch side could have elevated this dish to be lunch-time excellence. Like the portions, the prices are decent, with both of my visits coming in at just around $20 per person

There is one very short footnote-type comment that I must leave you with. On both occasions I was greeted by an employee whom I can only assume is the host. He will nab you on the street when you stop to glance at the menu to convince you to come in and, though he means well, will be extremely present during your time there. I can't say it was bothersome enough to warrant a phone call, but I also cannot give you my recommendation without mentioning this very obvious addition to the dining experience at Ultimate. 

So, I toyed with a 2-star vs. my decided upon 3-star rating. The decor is kind of cool, the service was fast and courteous, despite the over-attentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night. They offer some pretty good, if not somewhat lack-lustre grub, with at least one amazing sandwich. 

Just doors down from the previously reviewed Joe Mamas, King West is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me.

The Duke of Kent serves up traditional pub food in a cozy spot at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton.  Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different décor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.

After a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.

I snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!

As for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish & chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.

As I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.

For a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!

At the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!  My food may have only been so-so, but the brew was cold, and my night was great.

As soon as you step inside, your first thought will likely be that there is no possible way this place was built to be an Indian restaurant. The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only décor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.

Savoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.

Now, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.

Pleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.

I know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me. But if you're after more than just amazing Indian food, like say, an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff, then you may want to keep looking; you won't find that here. What you will find is skillfully cooked, delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive, friendly staff.

Bar Salumi is the unassuming sister bar-come-restaurant to The Local Kitchen in Parkdale.  It might be a little too unassuming for its own good, as many people seemed to question its whereabouts when I mentioned its name...but maybe Bar Salumi doesn't like the spotlight.  Indeed, its sign is almost an afterthought, with the store's original signage for an antique shop, dominating the storefront.

My friend and I had been meaning to go ever since she discovered they served Burrata pizza.  She really has a thing for that cheese, and I can't say I blame her. It's delicious.  We went awhile back, excited at the prospect of this new twist on a Margharita pie, only to find out the chef was on vacation and they were only serving up the liquid portion of their menu.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, and in some cases I would actually prefer it, but that night we were hungry and consequently, deflated. My friend entered the chefs ETA in her phone, and we vowed to return.

Two weeks later, the alarm sounded, reminding us that the chef was back to work (and also that she had golden potatoes ready to harvest in Smurf Village).  We went the very next day.

As it was on our previous visit, Bar Salumi was quiet and dark, illuminated by flickering chandeliers (leftovers from the former antique shop maybe?) and tea light candles housed within mason jars.  Hanging legs of prosciutto fight for space with ceiling fans, and a boar's head watches diners from high above on the back wall.  I know it might not sound like it (what with the strong presence of dangling cured meat and taxidermy) but it has a real romantic vibe happening.

There is no kitchen at Bar Salumi, so our personable apron-clad server was also our chef.  The menu is a small one, focused on pizza and apps, so diners can watch as everything is prepared behind the bar. It did get a bit hot, what with the pizza oven operating from within the same room, but think how cozy that would be on a winter's night.

The menu is presented on the wall in cafeteria style (or bowling alley) fashion, with those little plastic letters that slide in and out, and I half expected to see nachos and cheese listed somewhere.  More menus were brought to us on mini clipboards, and because the food menu was unnecessary as we had fully rehearsed our order, we paused awhile over the drink list.  They offer a thoughtful selection of reds and whites as well as some interesting cocktails.  We went with two glasses of Malbec ($12 each) to go with our starter of olives & nodini with ricotta salata ($4).  So far so good, except that I couldn't help but think the nodini crackers weren't the most functional choice for the cheese...more like basketball hoops for the olives.

Our pizza ($14), although not wood-fired, did come served on a cross-section of a tree trunk.  With the creamy white Burrata blending with the red of the San Marzano tomatoes, punctuated by basil it was like an homage to the Italian flag.  I wish I could say that the Burrata we were so looking forward to, made it the penultimate Margharita experience, but it was like any other made with Bufala.  The two are from the same family after all, so I'm not sure what we were thinking.  Cheese does things to people.  That being said however, we weren't disappointed, as the sauce was tangy, the crust was crispy, and it was big enough for both of us to eat and still take home leftovers.

I wouldn't rank the pizza with the likes of pie giants, Terroni or Libretto, but Bar Salumi is rife with ambience where the aforementioned aren't.  The promise of Buratta may have lured me in the first time, but it's the character that will bring me back.

Hey Meatball! Hey Mediocre! Walking into Hey Meatball! instantly feels like you are walking into your old high school cafeteria. A few two and four person tables are set up, and there's one long 16 person table down the middle, all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners. I wasn't entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction. We inquired with the cashier/order taker/owner to find out. I know he was the owner because he told us.

For a restaurant that serves all meatballs, all the time, we were surprised to find that there were only three entrée selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from. Of the four side dishes, two had already been crossed out for the day, leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup. I decided to order the vegetarian eggplant 'meatballs' with polenta and parmesan, and my dining partner ordered the Porky  meatballs, (a combination of pork and ground beef) with tomato sauce on spaghetti. Immediately I was told that they were out of polenta and was asked "what would I like it on?" Unsure of my options, even after asking, I replied with "spaghetti," as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that I was sure that they had in stock.

We each ordered a homemade cream soda, we were given a number, and we took a seat. Our number was called out about 10 minutes later, and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size. My eggplant 'meatballs' were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti, whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the children's menu- if there was one that is.

The food was good, but not great. The eggplant 'meatballs' had a nice consistency, and were spicy and full of flavor. The tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty, however I thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more. The Porky meatballs were excellent, the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit, however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dish.

The saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site. They were a throwback to the Jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid, but without too much fizz. Unfortunately, when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience, you know that there is something missing.

Hey Meatball! is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen, communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100-mile radius of Toronto. All great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable. There was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made Hey Meatball! mostly a letdown.

3030 has young-professional written all over it. Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.

3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).

One thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.

Much like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.

But with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.

Because none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.

If you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.

With a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.

I know St. Lawrence market is full of great food, but I never would've thought that tucked way in the back of the building I'd find something quite like Buster's Sea Cove.

Keep in mind though, this takeout shop isn't Rodney's or Oyster Boy, and I'm definitely not trying to convince you that it is. In fact, Buster's Sea Cove isn't even in the same boat. At Buster's, you won't find soft lighting, romantic ambience, or table-side service, but what you're pretty much guaranteed to find, is some killer seafood served up really, really quickly.

Fresh-made fish and chips are the staple in this place, but they've got so much more than that. Their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fish-topped salads. And their fish-type sandwiches, something that they happen to do really, really well, are outstanding. I'm not talking about your standard old fried-fish-on-a-bun here; Buster's rivals the best seafood takeout places with crab cake paninis and seared tuna melts sandwiches.

But don't overlook the fish and chips either. This little takeout stand easily delivers one of the best plates of the stuff in the city. They've got a few varieties of fish to choose from, and each of them is served up expertly battered and crispy. Each plate of fish and chips also comes with in-house made fries and a killer slaw.

Buster's also has a few other options you wouldn't expect from a takeout stand. Grilled swordfish, seafood bisque, rainbow trout, even octopus to name a few. It ain't fine dining by any means, but they truly do push the limits of what takeout is both in quality and selection.

Chances are though, once you get your food you'll be spending most of your time searching for a place to eat it. Busters only has 4 tables or so scattered around in front of the counter, but if those are full-and they probably will be-you're on your own. There's an exit close by to the Market's back patio and parking lot where most of Buster's customers end up, but trust me, if it's a nice day out, that'll fill up pretty quick too and you'll be left looking for a place to eat your by-then-getting-cold food.

Truth be told though, even if you're standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways, it won't matter all that much. You might not even notice. Whether it's a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips, the food at Buster's is just that dam good.

This sushi restaurant at the corner of Queen and Caroline is a take-out superstar. You can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance. If you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!

Just like the fish, the interior is raw. There is actually one very small table with some chairs around it by the front window, but I've never seen anyone sitting there. There's a display that sits just to the left when you walk in, covered with bags of Japanese snacks for purchase and, on your right, you'll find shelves filled with a few groceries; dried sheets of nori is one recognizable item that jumps out immediately.

Chef John Lee has been serving up fresh and beautiful sushi platters at this location since 2005. It is impressive to note that he worked under the iron chef himself, Morimoto. There is something soothing about the fact that they prepare your food behind the counter in full view. It's that commitment to preparing and presenting the freshest ingredients that has built their dedicated customer base.

Lunch combos range from $15 to $25 and dinner combos from $15 to $35. If you choose the sashimi - individual pieces of raw fish with no rice - it does bring the price up a bit, but it's well worth it for something so delectable. If ordering a la carte is more your style, there are unique rolls to choose from, including: nigiri sushi (fish on rice), small rolls, inside out rolls and special rolls with everything from eel to sea urchin to marinated dried pumpkin.

Our dinner for two was easily fulfilled with the vegetable sushi combo, which includes miso soup, and adding one Una Tekkyu roll (eel, tuna, cucumber, fish roe) and, my sushi must, an order of edamame. The vegetable rolls are prepped delicately to appear as if they too are made with tender slices of fish, the cucumber rolls are a refreshing addition and there is even a roll with an orange, crunchy vegetable called Burdock - carrot-like in appearance and texture, but with a different and unique flavour.

Their fresh ingredients are really the highlight. Nori can easily become chewy and tough, but Marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but I wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so I don't mind this one pre-prepared item.

If your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, Sushi Marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish.

For the past year or so, I've been meaning to go to Mitzi's Cafe for brunch.  Weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.  Fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) I am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a Tuesday...which is exactly what I did this week.

I love Mitzi's location.  Tucked away on a quiet corner of Sorauren, surrounded by century homes, purple and yellow painted Mitzi's is a bit out-of-place, but that's the appeal.  I have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores, and that's what Mitzi's reminds me of.  Inside looked exactly how I both expected and hoped for; arborite tables with mismatched chairs, a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time, and walls adorned with local art.  I really, really wanted to like this place.

And like it I did, however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience.  Let's start with mine shall we?  Mitzi's has a small but thoughtful menu, and I had previously perused it online, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  Craving sweet over savoury, I ordered the French toast as planned ($10.95).  Made with Challah bread it is then topped with a peach & ginger compote, covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup (the last step done by yours truly).  It was fantastic.  The bread was thick and fluffy, and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it.  It had all the makings of a dessert...in a breakfast.  It should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream, but I decided it was too much of an indulgence (says the person who used so much syrup as to make her French toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessons).

Sitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup, but not completely out of its reach, were the home fries, which offset the sweetness of the French toast nicely.  Made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of them, but it's probably for the best in the long run.  If the toast itself was the star of the show, then the home fries were the understudy.

As I had already had my morning coffee I chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orange/banana/mango juice.  It was just thick enough to know it was the real thing, and at $3 I think it was good value.

The glowing endorsement ends with my friends order.  She was so looking forward to her poached eggs (also $10.95).  Served on Portuguese cornbread, topped with wilted spinach,  and slathered in roasted red pepper & asiago sauce, it looked delicious when set down in front of her, but as she cut into the egg with her fork, the yolk failed to flow.  Her poached eggs weren't poached at all... they were hard-boiled.  Cue the violins. Tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty.

This would have been a 4 star review had I made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.  Mitzi's is still worth a visit though for the French toast (and I hear the Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes are pretty killer too), but if it's poached eggs you crave, be specific,...if only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being.

Relatively new to the King West theatre district, and across the street from the Bell Lightbox is, Paese.  New to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, Paese has been operating out of their Bathurst street location since 1989.  Serving up Italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, Paese might give longtime district resident Kit Kat some competition.

With a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, Paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).

My server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.

Next, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.

As full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.

I had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.

Paese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...

Because of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.

The Bar with No Name recently opened up in the place where the ever-empty Z-Bar used to be, and the signs of them still working out the kinks of being a newly opened place are still there. It was fairly obvious that the space was still in the process of being turned into something else, and there was still a lot of remenants of Z-Bar to be found. I've been to Z-Bar once, and I couldn't really tell the difference between the two, except for the kick-ass, inviting new Bar With No Name sign out front.

Simply put, No Name's staff are amazing, thoughtful, and exactly how food biz staff shoudl be. They were really concerned with making sure we had a good time, and because of them, our experience was good. Even though the place was busy, they still made time to chat with us and didnt make us feel rushed.

No Name's food menu was the standard bar fare. Burgers, wings, and fried foods were front and center, but despite the plainness of the menu, the food was hot, fresh, and served the way it should be.

The music in this place, however, really needs some improvements. We probably would have stayed for another drink if it wasn't for commercials blasted over the radio being the only form of entertainment. I asked if they could put some sattelite radio on, and I was told not to worry because a DJ was going to be playing soon. I left at 1030, and I never saw or heard a DJ, just Leon's, Loblaw's, and car commercials at full volume.

It does seem as though they rushed to open, and they probably could have used another week or two to get things together, but once they get it all worked out, this place stands a great chance at becoming the perfect neighbourhood hangout.

*We plan to review again in two months.

There is a new kid in town, and his name is Pachuco - named after the look and style of Mexican youth back in the 1930s to 1950s that dressed in zoot suits. Pachuco opened its doors on Friday, January 13th, perhaps a sign of bad luck, but that shouldn't hinder their success.

Pachuco is a small (read: reservations) and cozy space, with exposed brick walls, wrought-iron décor and, and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign. Even though Pachuco shares a kitchen with older brother and Danforth favourite  Embrujo Flamenco, they definitely serve up their own distinctive flavour.
Their menu is well thought out and varied, with an excellent selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Their appetizer menu alone is worth the trip. With a confident boasting of guacamole flavours, including goat cheese, blue cheese, smoked trout and walnut, and a guacamole sampler patter that allows you to try three of their creations, there is seemingly no end to the interesting flavour combinations. We decided to stick to our guns, however, and go with the traditional guacamole, which was a stellar choice; lots of lime, onion and creamy avocado, but with no flavour left too overpowering. Their homemade tortilla chips have to be mentioned as well: crisp and tasty. I am hoping they will one day provide these in a to-go bag for purchase before you leave. We also ordered the Chile poblana, swathed in an excellent and perfectly spicy tomato sauce, with queso fresco and refried beans, all baked perfectly. The portion size on both entrees was more than enough for two people, and it could easily serve as a great entrée.

For our meals (both $15) we went with the Taquitos de Machaca (coffee and ancho braised beef brisket, with guacamole and honey chipotle salsa), and the pre-Hispanic delicacy of Taquitos de Huitlacoche (corn truffle, onions, jalapeño peppers, Cazuela beans served with requesón-avocado salsa). Where to start? Let's save the most interesting for last. The braised beef was well cooked and well spiced, the chipotle salsa was a great added touch, and one order of beans and rice between the two of us was more than enough to share. In fact, we both left incredibly full. Their fresh-this-second corn tortillas are amazing, sweet, soft and still warm from the press, prepared just the way you would expect to find them in a traditional Mexican eatery. The Huitlacoche, however, was an adventure in and of itself. 

For those who don't know (myself included), Huitlacoche is a fungus, which grows naturally on corn in damp environments. The fungus is harvested and has been consumed as a delicacy for centuries in Central and South America cuisine. When it arrived, it tasted smokey and earthy; it looked like a dark mash of black corn, onion- and was that a jalapeño in there? Hard to tell. The dish was good, but I can't say I would strongly recommend it. Overall, I found the food at Pachuco's to be mostly over-salted, and the Huitlacoche had to be the worst offender. This is the main reason why I would not order it again; although the flavour was very different from any other Mexican dishes I have tried, and I actually did enjoy it, I just could not get over the intensity of the salt. 

The drinks and food at Pachuco's ranged from good to very good, and if they could tone down the salt (margaritas included), I would probably rate most of it as excellent. However, I cannot say our overall experience was excellent, but I would not fault them for it in my overall rating. Being that it was their opening weekend, one expects a few hiccups, and I am sure they will be cleared up by the time you visit. I was served the wrong meal at first, and we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the Huitlacoche to be prepared, instead of the fish tacos, (though delightful looking), I was initially served. By the time my dish came around, the other half of our meal was cold. Our side plates and used cutlery were never removed from our table after we finished with our appetizers, and the tables are so small and cramped as it is, there was no room for our mains. Instead of removing our side plates, there was a vain attempt to stuff everything on the table. I eventually had to ask for fresh cutlery and removal of the used dishes from our table. Not once, but twice, we almost had our not-quite-finished drinks taken from us, and we had to ask a few times for extra tortillas. It seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time, and as great as they were, they are very, very small, so I imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own. 

Overall, I think these are minor complaints, especially since it was Pachuco's opening preview. I found that the service was friendly and genuine, the restaurant was quaint and ambient, with Latin music, candles and a few kitschy décor details, which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to it's self-proclaimed 'Modern Mexican' dining experience.

Huge Apple Danishes! Unfortunatley huge doesnt mean better. 
So what does Westmall Donuts have to offer? Here you can eat a fattening overpriced danish in a horribly old and decrepid space and wash it all down with a lousy tasting coffee.
Do yourself and your wallet a favour and avoid it!

Boy-oh-boy, do I ever feel let down. I actually went out of my way to go to this place one day when I was craving some good-ole-fashioned-BBQ. Claiming to be serving it up in true Southern-style, I thought that there's no way this could go wrong. I've actually been to Texas and all throughout the Southern states on a fairly serious eating vacation, and lemme tell you something, The Drake and their lil' BBQ place owe the great state of Texas and its surrounding neighbours a serious apology...

Drake BBQ has a slew of great reviews all over the Internet. Everyone on Yelp, Twitter, and a bunch of TO food mags have been raving about the authentic, bad-ass Texas and Carolina style BBQ they've had in this place. I've read so many good comments, that I figured I must have gone to the wrong place. Maybe, I thought, there was some other place that just happens to look exactly the same, on the exact same street, with the exact same type of food?

Nope... I was in the right place. It just sucked is all.

Because they have such a loyal following, I'm sure quite a few people are going to dislike what I'm saying here, but in all honesty, if you got served what I did, you'd be disappointed too. My Carolina pulled-pork sandwich was small, dry, and amazingly enough, was completey void of BBQ sauce, which is a fairly important staple in a pulled-pork sandwich. They must have had some BBQ sauce somewhere in there, but if they did, they didn't offer it to me, and it certainly wasn't on my sandwich. My coleslaw was even worse. It was incredibly bland and wasn't much more than shredded cabbage with a slight trace of what I assume was salad dressing. Not to mention that this stuff was expensive! Two of those sandwiches and an itty-bitty coleslaw-plus tip of course-cost over 20 bucks.

Welcome to The Drake BBQ; it's BBQ with a side of pretentiousness. You don't like it? Trust me. If it's the same guy working behind the counter when I was there, then he won't care at all. I asked if we could get some fries with our sandwiches. he just looked at me, shocked, and said, 'I don't want a deep-fryer in this place'. Hey, I'm fine with the guy being pretentious and true to the stuff he's making and how he's making it, especially if it's honest-to-goodness Southern-style BBQ. If he truly was an artisan of the BBQ and the smoker, he can rightfully be as pretentious as he wants as far as I'm concerned. I probably would have answered back with an agreeing 'Yes Sir'! But the true kick-in-the-ass was that the stuff that I ended up taking home in a sad little brown bag was basically less than edible. In fact, I only took a few bites and ended up throwing it out, which is something I never, ever do. Someone went and filled thsi guy's head with the thought that this is actually what good BBQ is all about; someone lied to him.

Besides being about honest and delicious BBQ, the Southern states are all about hospitality and genuine people; people that would never be rude or unwelcoming. They're more likely to invite you in for dinner than they are to turn you away. Drake BBQ was none of those things. The service was rude, inhospitable, and unwelcoming. From the moment I walked in, I felt as though they wanted me the hell outta there. That is, except for the older guy that handed me the bag. He sent me off with a sincere sounding 'thanks for your business', which is something I think businesses don't say enough these days.

Like I said, this was painful for me. I felt ripped off. I felt sad. I felt let down. It was a just a plain bad experience that was nothing close to true Southern BBQ or Southern hospitality. In fact, I don't think I would even give it another go, and whether you've been exposed to true Southern BBQ or not, I'd suggest you don't either, because you'll feel let down either way too.

Tapas seem to be all the hype recently. And it's easy to see why. Not only does it allow you to try more things on the menu, but it's also perfect for when you're  with a larger group. And that is just the reason why a couple of my friends and I headed to the Ossington area to try out Foxley, an Asian-Vietnamese inspired tapas house.

The restaurant ambiance doesn't mimic anything I typically associate with a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. It has a classier fine dining style of décor with ginger brick walls and soft lighting; it's a  perfect romantic date spot. In fact, we saw lots of couples there that night all dining on a few plates and enjoying wine.

My friends and I decided to follow suit, so we split a bottle of red and ordered the most interesting dishes that caught our eyes on the menu. This however, was a task easier said than done. The menu comes on a single-sided laminated sheet, with no pictures. It was hard to distinguish where the descriptions of one dish started and the next one ended. It felt a little like reading an essay! But once you get over the poor formatting, you'll be amazed by the variety of dishes that they offer. There is no shortage of exotic meats and dishes, like frog legs and beef hearts. But if you're not feeling that adventurous, rest assured they also do have many good old reliable classics, like deep fried shrimps, steamed mussels, and spring rolls.

The first dish that came was the Lamb and Duck Prosciutto Dumplings" ($7). These were served hot,crunchy and  with jam packed with minced lamb stuffing. They're tasty, but nothing too special..

Next came a Sea Bream Creviche with Yuzu and Shiso ($15). They're bite sizes pieces of thinly sliced sea bream sashimi, covered with coriander and some lime puree. I actually found them to be a little too citrusy for my liking, but it is undeniably fresh. It was paired well with the crunchy fried onions generously sprinkled on top.

After that, a whole slew of dishes came at the same time, and it was difficult to figure out which one to dig into first; they all looked and smelled so appetizing! The Grilled Marinated Beef Short Ribs ($14) came on a small plate with about 3-4 pieces. A little too chewy for my liking, but it was at least well marinated and flavourful. In comparison, the Grilled Side Ribs with Caramelized Shallot Glaze ($9.00) were delicious. They were made up of two long pork ribs covered in a savory sweet glaze, with meat that fell right off the bone. We literally demolished that dish in a couple of seconds!

If you're a big fan of pork belly as I am, then you'll be in for a real treat at Foxley. They serve a Slow-braised Pork Belly in Muscatel Reduction ($15) with nicely marbled fat and cooked in a delicious smokey barbeque sauce ;it just melts in your mouth!

And while all those dishes were great, my favourite of the night was the Grilled Beef Heart with Chili Lime Salsa ($8). We ordered it just to try something new, and it was the best decision of the night! It came nicely grilled on two skewers so that the hearts are slightly charred on the outside for flavour, and still tender on the inside. Don't be afraid to try this one, it actually doesn't taste as farfetched as it sounds!

To balance out all the meat we ordered, the chef recommended the Kale Salad with Pecorino Toscano and Lemon Dressing ($8). I love kale, so in my books this salad was definitely a good order. My only complaint was that the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too sour.

Upon finishing up the meal, the first thought I had was that Foxley is not as "Asian fusion" as I had anticipated. There are some influences, but not nearly enough for me to notice the Asian aspect of the menu. That does not go to say that I didn't enjoy my meal though. While I found it was a little on the pricier side, I did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere. Keep Foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends.

Disgraceland isn't bad, but it's definitely a bit overrated. Thier biggest fault is that it's completly hit-or-miss. Somedays everything comes together, other times... 

Their menu takes an exceptionally creative look at stuff you'd expect to find in the southern states with heavy concern for those that prefer meatless. Everything from Southern-fried chicken and Tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches. They also have a fairly original selection of sauces to dip your fries in that's worth mentioning. The staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there.

But like I said, all of that can change the next time you go in. Food could come out luke warm and greasy, staff could be stuck-up and simply not care. 

Disappointingly enough, the one thing that you can count on that Disgraceland has that is consistently great, is one hell-of-a cool name.

I came across The Burger's Priest purely by accident one day when I was biking in the Beaches neighbourhood. It's an easy little place to overlook; it's just a small shop with little advertising way out on Queen East. But boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this place. Hands down this was one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. 

First off, it was actually cooked a little over medium-- without me asking! Truly a rarity nowadays, the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature. Beautiful. Besides being cooked perfectly, the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury patty.

The fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy in-house. While that makes them perfect for eating right away, I do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them. But for me, it was pure fry bliss.

The space is modern, clean, and stainless-steel heavy, but because of it's size, it only has seating for about 4 people. Once the place gets a lineup, which at peak times is completely inevitable, the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat in.

Next time you happen out to the Beaches, definitely check this place out, or even if you're not in the neighbourhood, this place is totally worth the drive.

The Kensington Cornerstone offers a gluten free menu.  It has gluten free beer.  It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.

This past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.

It was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. 

Just when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and/or mojitos, and/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.

When our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.

So by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. 

(Sound of clock ticking)

Another half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. 

My mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.

Looking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. 

After we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.

I have been here 3 1/2 years.   The staff is always smiling and helpful.   Yes it takes maintenance a little longer then they should but it seems like a large place for only 2 guys to handel.   The fitness center needs a little upgrade but I have lived at other places and this is a great place.  I see a few people complaining and name calling which I find childish.  If they hate it so much why don't they move.

I am going on a long vacation out of the country and talked to DISH on Sept 19. 2016. I told them to cancel my service on Sept 30, 2016. I also was told to give them notice at least two before to get the return boxes. I did this on the 19 and was told the boxes would be sent. Now on the 27 no boxes. I called again the agent said they were sent wait two more day now the 29 no boxes. I just called today to find out the boxes were never sent. I am leaving on October 4, 2016. The person said they would try to get the boxes to me before October 3 and also gave me a number of one of there retailer outlet. This was to see if they would pick up the equipment they said they could not if they did I would be charged month to month. This again shows DISH has no service or communication within their company. I am very disappointed that I have been lie to by over three representative. I do not expect to see the boxes for the return in the time they promised. I would not recommend this company if something as easy as this cannot be processed.

This place is not just a restaurant has a great bar and a outside deck with one of the best views of Las Vegas. The food is good and selections is limited. Drink are on the expensive side and it is a private club. I would recommend there steak with crab. It has a disco at night at 10 pm the space is small and can be crowded. I would recommend this place and I am going back again.

I called them Monday morning asking what was the problem they told me I could not get service for TV in my area really. After they had schedule a appointment and there customer service people did not even know they could not give me these services. I wasted a whole Saturday waiting for these people. Their customer service is horrible do not waist your time. Now I know why they have such a low rating.

I was just at their new store on Cheyenne on Sunday. I wanted a soft mattress Christine gave me a great selection. I told her I only wanted to spend up to $1200 dollars. I had more than 4 choices all were less than I had planned. I had checked other stores first and the mattress I got was equal or even better at half the price. They even gave me sheet and cover for the mattress as a bonus for shopping at the new store. I did not realize they also sold furniture pick up a full 5 piece bedroom set. It was just like the ones I had been looked at some of the bigger furniture stores again half the price. I going to tell all my friend check this store first.

I can't say enough about what Brenda has done for us. My husband and I rescued Pepper and knew he was the dog for us despite the expected behavior problems coming from a rescued pup! She helped me identify the core of our issues with Pepper, and we faced them head-on! I had a perfectly behaved dog inside my apartment; sit, stay, free, park it (code for go lay down)- no problem! Our struggle was on walks and going anywhere. Pepper is an incredibly protective pup, and any dog or cat we saw, from any distance, would evoke jumping and barking which was incredibly impactful on our lifestyle. I had zero control over him outside of the apartment. Brenda taught me how to gain control outside of my home, and brought a variety of different dogs to increase Pepper's tolerance to dogs and to practice my new favorite term "LEAVE IT!". 

Long story short, we are still working everyday to improve Pepper's socialization, but we recently had a doggy play date and he did AMAZING! I can go on walks without an overwhelming feeling of panic, walk by cats without worry, and can even take the occasional hike when we know we only have to practice "leave it" a few times :) I am no longer afraid to take our dog for a long walk, or to bring him to new places!

I do NOT recommend this store. They were so bad it actually made me set up a Yelp account so that I could review them. A friend sent flowers for my birthday which they tried to deliver late in the afternoon when I was not at home.  When the girl called she said that they would redeliver the flowers the next morning. I told her to bring them to my neighbor as that I would not be at home. My neighbor waited at home till 12 noon and no flowers arrived.  I  got home at 12 and called them and said where are my flowers?  The woman apologized and said that her supervisor would give me a call. Of course, no call. So, I called them yet again. They said they were on the truck and would be here by the end of the day.  Once again no flowers. So I called again and said, hey it's almost closing time for you where are my flowers? The answer was don't worry they'll be there.  They weren't.  Next morning my father waited at my house for the delivery of the missing flowers. Of course again no flowers.  So I called them at 12 noon again and said if I do not have them by the end of the day I would be coming into the store personally and picking up my flowers or canceling the order for my friend. Shockingly, the flowers showed up a half hour later. Of course, they were no longer in the best condition. They weren't horrible but they weren't the freshest either. Of course they were now almost 3 days late. I would NOT recommend this store. They didn't even seem to care that was the worst part.

I have passed this spot hundreds of times but being a creature of habit, I have never stopped to try, opting instead for Fenwick's (Oh! Fenwick's-- must write a review!)which is almost next door.  When I found a coupon in our Citipass book for a free sushi roll, I decided to give it a try.

Unassuming atmosphere, which I appreciate.  Generally, when I dine, I am looking for a food experience, espeically in this price-point.  They have a very limited wine list, and a very limited beer selection, no cocktails!  Which, again, is all fine... who can't enjoy a Tsing Tao?

We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a summer roll (special roll of the evening), and a crunchy roll.  My husband enjoyed all of them.  I, on the other hand, don't love spicy mayo on all of my rolls, so I enjoyed but did not love.  But, for the price, it is definitely worth a try.  I fear I have turned into a sushi snob :(

Our service was fine.

Tip-- Wear a sweater!  It was freezing in there!

This is a fine place to dine but nothing special.  I do appreciate that they have vegetarian chili which is the perfect topping for their taco salad.  The taco salad is good, as are the huge baked potatoes.  

Kids dine free at McAlister's on various evenings, but the kids menu is not great and the portions are for toddlers. 

This is a quick in and out, and in the winter a good place to grab a cup of soup, as the offerings change daily.  

The sweet tea gets 4 stars.

Jalapeno Pale Ale?  Yes, please!  Mexicali Stout?  Yep!  The on-site brewed beer here is awesome.  Creative, delicious and local.  A perfect hat trick of beers!

They had a great accoustic singer who started in the afternoon but got talked into playing into the evening... he was fantastic.

The atmosphere is pretty bare-bones, which is nice.  A long picnic table, some bar tables and some covered outdoor seating that I cannot wait to try.  It was COLD in there, my husband wore his coat and I used mine as a blanket... 

The service is friendly.  The crowd, as usual for NODA, is ecclectic and fun, friendly and non-pretentious.  They also offer a 1/2 gallon fill-up to go, or to enjoy on-site, which was a great price at $14.

Bonus: they serve peanuts.

Seriously? This restaurant has 4 crepe options on the menu for dinner.  Totally disappointed. The spinach and mushroom crepe was delicious but it was the only vegetarian option.  Call me crazy, but with a name like "Crepe Cellar" I imagined several options...

The tap beers are a sampling of the UK... Which is great but the best local brews are a block away.

The atmosphere is nice.  We sat at the bar.  My hubs had the fish and chips, which he enjoyed.  We skipped dessert.  MIght be a better option for brunch?

My 5 year old attended art camp here with a friend.  It was a 3 hour camp and when I realized it was only 4 days instead of 5, the value of this camp sharply decreased... oh!  but wait a minute... they released a coupon for pay for one child and the second goes free!  Score!  This only worked for me because I had not paid for our session yet.  Had I already paid, this deal would not have applied.  Imagine how disappointed my responsible, early-paying friend was when she realized the offer was not available to her!

The camp itself was well run and organized.  The art work was adorable.  My daughter had a great time and did not get too messy!  They also gave them fun snacks.

The camp is advertised for up to age 10 but my "free" 10 year old only went twice as it is really geared toward the younger children.

I love a lot of things and live music is at the top of my list.  This venue has a great old school place feel and is a fun place to take in a show.  It appeared to be cement from floors to ceiling, with two different stages- one for a bigger show and one for a smaller crowd. (It is definitely not the Belk Theatre but I cut my teeth at the Milestone, so a grungy-ish venue is fun for me). There were pool table(s), a few booths and bar tables near the bar, and a great outdoor area with seating and fun, colorful lights.  The bartenders were friendly and they have a great selection of beer on tap-- and the beer is reasonably priced!  They also have a full bar... but with some good local beers on tap, why not support our budding QC brewery market?

The accousitcs were fine.  But, I enjoyed the Prince concert at TWC which received awful reviews for accoustics... 

I am jazzed about another great venue from which I can get my music fix!  Psychedelic Furs, anyone?

Target at Midtown is a fantastic shopping experience, especially if you happen to have Val as your cashier.  She is a smack-talking hoot!

Seriously, with parking that protects you from rain and all aisles usually open, how can you not love this Target?  

Don't get me wrong, I am all about shopping local, but with 3 children that need a dump truck load of back-to-school supplies, Target is my choice.  And, seriously, where else can you pick up a cute top, scarf and set of sheets, while simultaneously loading up a cart with colored pencils, paper, and notebooks?  (And their junior dept. clothes, while tricky to find smaller sizes, are hard to distinguish from pricier brands... a huge bonus to this mother of a middle schooler).

I am not a 5-star person.  I think everyone/everything has room for improvement.  But, Fenwick's?  They are spot-on, delicious every time.  

This is owned and operated by Catherine, of Catherine's on Providence for any old-time Charlottean.  She is a superb chef!  Her culinary and wine skills are some of the best in Charlotte.

This is not fine dining.  It is not fancy.  In fact, it is quirky and small and you often feel a little close to your dining neighbor.  

Must try:  Tomato Bisque Soup, it comes as a side option with their meals.  My hubbie says these are the best burgers in Charlotte... I am a veggie, and I beleive their grilled veggie burger is the best in town.  Their fries are great.  Sweet potato fries?  Delicious!  Tuna salad, with  melt-in-your-mouth croutons and an array of homemade dressings to choose from?  Pure yumminess.  My husband also adores the club sandwich.  Oh, and the muffins.  Delectable!

As creatures of habit, my order is always the same: Veggie burger, with cheese, side of soup and fruit.  And this is a 5-star meal delivered with 5-star service.  

Sit at the bar and get to know your neighbors!

Pretty tight for families with children... I don't bring my younger ones in here.

Me loves!

The stir fried wide noodles are perfection!  

The make your own spring rolls are my favorite... a big plate overflowing with fresh mint, basil, cilantro, noodles, bean sprouts, cucumber, and tofu.  Soak your rice wrap in the hot water, fill with goodness, squirt with siriachi, and dip in sauce.  Delight taste buds.  Repeat. Again and again.

The atmosphere is nothing to write home about but with authentic food like this, who cares?

This has been a favorite for 13 years or more.  I have tried a lot of the menu items and have never been disappointed, but my favorite remains the make-your-own spring rolls.  A close second is the vegetable hotpot, and my children love (like squeal-out-loud love) the fried pineapple rice-- it arrives in a pineapple boat and it is delicious.

First off-- you do not come here for atmosphere.  They have gussied the place up a bit with some fake bamboo and updated posters on the walls.  The fact that you can see a run down laundromat and a car inspeciton station that may or may not be boarded up should not deter you from this spot.  

Do come for the hot tea, the service, and the food.  It is outstanding.  Although, the rumor is the "original" Lang Van owners are now the owners of Ben Thanh (which might explain my love affair with that restaurant).  The staff is so helpful and knowledgable in assisting with food selections.  We have taken several people here for their first visit and our waitperson has always helped make selections that were enjoyed by our guests!

The food is plentiful.  You will not leave here hungry!  Flat noodles, hot pots and spring rolls are our favorites (and the aforementioned fried pineapple).  We also love the little cookies that come with the check... perfectly sweet but do have peanuts.

--This is a FUN place to bring a small group of people (6ish) to sit around a round table and share food.--

--This is a great restaurant for children to experience delicious and healthy food.  The servers dote on well-behaved children here.--

I cannot say enough about this church and I don't know where to start!

Aside from the obvious, the church is utterly gorgeous, the people are what make this place truly spectacular.  There is a widely diverse population at this church, which can be surprising to new visitors.  There is a Buddhist group that meets here, a Sunday School class for LGBT and friends, and people of all colors.  The minister here is Stephen Shoemaker and he is incredibly educated, intellectual and compassionate.  He is a pillar in the faith community in Charlotte.  The outreach of this church is also impressive.  Service projects and taking care of thy neighbor abounds here.

There are great Sunday School classes for adults and children alike.  The little ones often are found riding tricycles in the gym after SS and during the church service.  There are sports teams, a gym, art classes, computer classes, etc... offered here.  We have participated in many and loved them all.

They also have really great small group offerings-- interested in art?  drinking beer at pubs?  going to movies?  and somehow tying this back into Christianity?  Or maybe you want to be an earth keeper, a hiker or a yogi?  They have it all.

My favorite thing about this church?  No need to check your intellect at the door.

Dr. Eap is a healer in the truest sense of the word.  She not only has her Naturopathic degree from one of the most esteemed programs in the country, she also lived and studied with ancient healers and monks in Asia.  She is a true holistic practitioner-- mind, body, spirit.  This is an experience unlike any other...

She uses kinesiology to test the body for weaknesses.  She then prescribes any array of herbal supplements, and other unconventional treatments.  Sometimes it feels a little voo-doo-ish, but conventional doctors are just "practicing" medicine and dispensing potent drugs with known side effects... both seem scary to me, but the natural approach seems less so.  And, honestly, I showed up barely able to function from tiredness and fatigue, beaten up from medical procedures and under the care of an oncologist (for a noncancerous condition).  She really restored my energy.

I credit Dr. Eap for restoring my health back to a place of wellness.  

--It is expensive and not covered by insurance--
--I eventually had to stop going, the supplements were getting to be too many for me to keep up with--
--I will definitely go again, when my pocketbook and time can manage it--

Great, knowledgeable and friendly service: first the nice manboy (not sure how old he is... looked like a baby, acted like a polite adult) was awesome in making sure I was buying the best helmets for my kids.  He went in and out of their stock room several times to get it all correct.  Secondly, he asked if I needed boxes (I didn't have to arm wrestle him for them!) and he was genuinely excited when he found out I was Santa(they loaded all my Christmas loot into my sleigh that looks like a Suburban).   They also have the cutest chocolate lab that is in here on occasion.  Seriously, who does not love the beautiful face and aggressive wagging of the tail of a lab?    This place has all the snow and skateboard gear one might need.  Great priced helmets for skating and skiing, great penny board selection.  

The Tom's, Ugg, Sanuk and Rainbow shoe selection is insane.  Seriously, blows Nordstrom out of the water... kids and adult sizes!  And Sanuks are hard to find... my husband loves them and so does my brother in law (who is a surgeon and on his feet all day).  They are also hip without being hipster :)  But, with skinny jeans could def fall into the hipster category!

I love Dr. Sowell and all of his office staff.  I could not find it in me to give a dentist 5-stars.  I dread, and I do mean, DREAD going to the dentist. 

His hygenists are awesome.  Melissa is my favorite.  HIs front desk staff is wonderful.  For those suffering from severe dental anxiety, he will give a magic pill 30 minutes prior to any work to be done.  I have not done this... yet.

He also sees well-behaved children. That said, he sees 2 of 3 of mine ;) and is great with them.

With $1.00 Icees (cherry, coke or mixed) and .50 cent vanilla ice cream cones, this is a great place to treat children to something "special."  The indoor play area is clean and never crowded.  

BK also offers veggie burgers but make sure to ask them to hold the mayo if you do not want your sandwich swimming in it.

I do love this park, really, I do... but, I do not feel safe here by myself or alone with my children, hence the 3 stars. In fact, I was stopped by a police officer who told me as much.  So, with 3 children in tow, we loaded up and went to another park.  I was thankful he told me this, as I was feeling like that but felt I was being paranoid.  Without that significant detail, this would be a 4 star park.  

I think the little splash park is big fun for younger children, although it can get quite crowded and there are, as always, those parents who do not monitor their children's behavior.

The playground is super fun!  Big, fast slide and great swings.  Great recycled plastic chips in lieu of mulch.

Awesome picnic shelter and wonderful, open field for kick ball or soccer.

Nice winding paths that feel like you are really in the woods instead of steps from one of Charlotte's cutest neighborhoods.

--I did find several used condoms on the playground and on the lovely walking paths.  

This is not a "go-to" park for me... Charlotte has too many wonderful options.

I love this park.  I love the tennis courts.  I love the lake (or pond?).  I love the aggressive geese that steal picnic dinners out of unsuspecting children's hands.  I love the interesting people that study, read, and play frisbee on "hippie hill".  I love the bridge to the band shell.  I love the yoga that is offered here on occasion.  I love the caddywampus dogs that people are walking here.  I love the random fishermen.  I love catching a little bit of a baseball game here.  I love the train.  I love the second playground with its big sandbox and swings.  I love the nature trails.  BUT, the thing I love the most is having a picnic in this park on a lovely day-- loading my car with scooters and bicycles and balls and dolls and watching my children behave wildly!  I also love the lacrosse for girls offered by CYLA at this park.  

--Festival in the Park is a fun (but crowded) event held here annually.
--lots of charity walks and runs here...
--bathrooms are at your own risk!  yucky!

The Leo has to be one of the best salads in Charlotte; with its chopped lettuce and mint and parsley, cucumber and tomatoes it cannot get into my mouth fast enough!  The pita that comes with it is perfect for sponging up the remaining lemon vinegarette that is too tasty to waste.

I like the falafel here, too.  Crispy on the outside and not mealy on the inside.  My hubs likes the meat specials and gyro.

and the baklava?  like taking a bite out of an angel.

I love this Teeter! Not as overwhelming as the Taj M'Teeter.  I generally find a good parking place and they generally have all otheir lanes open with a bagger in each lane.  I appreciate all of those things!  

If you shop VIC specials, the Teeter is a good value.  You will shoot your wad if you run in here unprepared, without a list in hand!

The management at this store is incredibly gracious.  I brought home some HT Organic Milk that was spoiled.  I returned it and they refunded my money and gave me the name brand equivalent.  

My kids love all the samples they have out in the store.  Bonus!

One of life's most frustrating experiences is shopping for  (and with ) a middle school daughter.  She chose this as our destination.  Really, I was ready to open my wallet and just be done.  Too bad the sales staff was unhelpful and a little... rude.  I asked them, very pointedly, for help.  I knew my daughter would trust their opinion more than mine (and they were both wearing those mullet shirts --you know long in the back, short in the front-- and, well, that is just not a style I am able to work with, so I did not just want their help, I *needed* their help).  They nonchalantly pointed to a section of clothes that she "might" like.  I inquired about help with sizing, to which, again, I was met with no offer of help.  She tried on a few things but she was frustrated with sizing and I was annoyed, so we left, empty handed.

To be sure, this is not my style of clothing, but I know there are some school friends that have picked up some cute clothes in here.  With all the options available in Charlotte, and when I am paying full-retail pricing (to be fair-- their retail pricing is affordable/reasonable, hence 3 stars), I expect better and more helpful service.  

I opened my wallet somewhere else... where I got to sit and watch the salesgirls work their magic and help my daughter feel a little special.

Great place to watch a game.  On Sundays they have a make-your-own Bloody Mary bar which is outstanding.  They are also cheap-- $4 (I think) and also have a Mimosa special.  

I have not eaten a meal here.  I have had the pimento cheese dip (which was an awful consistency-- think not-all-the-way melted Velveeta), I have seen the wings, and had a various assortment of fried bar food.  It was all fine.  My friends thought the burger was delicious-- both were suffering from the liquor flu so I am not trusting their judgment 100%.

The service here has never been good.  

The location works.  The back patio is fun (has its own bar) and the Bloody Mary bar is fun.  This is a place to go and drink, not go to eat.  And don't be surprised if you have to get your own drink from the bar because your server is no where to be found.

Maybe I am just disgruntled.  I miss the Press box being here...

I love The Fillmore.  I was between 4 and 5 stars and the reason I went with 4 stars is because I paid $18 on Wednesday night for two Bud Lights.... and I think that is ridiculous.  And I am not a fan of the VIP seating they had on the second level for the Willie Nelson concert... it took up way too much room, making the venue feel a little overcrowded.  These seats were not there for the Black Crowes or Five for Fighting and I prefer them not to be there the next time I am lucky enough to take in a show here.

The bathrooms are great here, which is an added bonus and a surprise!

This venue is fantastic for those who love to get up close and for those who want a more intimate setting for a show.  Really, Willie was spectacular and I loved the small venue for such a big man.  It makes it nearly impossible to think of going to a coliseum/arena event.

Shows often sell out, so buy tickets early!

I am a fan of Slate Interiors!  I love the art, the unique tables, lamps, chairs, chandeliers, home accessories, etc.. There is always something unique here that I want to take home with me.  It is the type of place that makes you dream of how you might decorate a beach house, a mountain house, a contemporary house, etc.. The prices are reasonable on most things.  Occasionally, I feel like the pricing has no rhyme or reason.

They tend to have great mid-century pieces but these move quickly!  A lot of their merchandise turns over, so it is always a new shopping experience.  If you see it and you want it-- BUY IT!  I have lost several great things because I wanted to "think about it."

The place is overflowing with wonderful local art.  I have noticed these pieces don't seem to sell as quickly as the furniture.

For the most part, the booths are well laid out with lovely inventory.  There are a few that could use a good makeover.

The people who work here are friendly, though I did buy an set of something and received a phone call that the price tag on the item was incorrect, it was not for both pieces of the pair but had been priced per item.  I was told I could either pay the new price or return the items.  I opted to return the items and they wanted it back within 24 hours.  As this was their mistake, and I live across town, I thought this was poor customer service.  

All in all it is in my top 5 places to browse interior goods.

I would give zero stars, if I could.  We hired H & S to install new brackets on our gutters around our entire house-- we were told they also should have been screwed in rather than nailed, and they would do that, too.  They came, "did it", I paid and they left.  Only, they did not do it.  My husband got up on the roof to blow leaves and NOT ONE new bracket had been installed.  The assumption that I have made in regards to this is they had no idea that I am married to someone who still blows his own leaves and cleans his own gutters and thought that we would never know the work was not done.  

They have come out to do the job properly.

I wanted to love this place.  Really, I did.  It is so close to home, I was hoping it would be a "go-to" place for my hubs and me.  Not so much.

The interior is lovely.  The water feature is really cool.  I love the tile.  I hope to find it for a backsplash in my kitchen.  Yes, those are the thoughts that were going through my head as my uninspired meal arrived.

The berry mojito was good.  The wine list is nice and reasonably priced.  The service was.... weird.  Maybe because we were one of only three tables in there on a Saturday night but, we felt like we were being stalked.

Seaweed salad-- great.  Hard to really mess this up.  House salad with ginger dressing-- ok, here is where I show my odd palate-- I prefer iceberg with my ginger dressing, not field greens.  But, field greens are fancier, so field greens is what I got.  Fine (no stars taken off for this).

The rolls-- spicy tuna, a special roll, and a few slabs of shashimi.  All ok.  Not wowwonderful. Not even, wow! And pricey. And small (which I prefer, but my hub was disappointed).  I get that I am paying for atmosphere, too.  BUT, there was NO ONE there, which felt a little creepy.  Or sad.  Even our server seemed sad.  The atmosphere, lovely water feature aside, was odd.  

3.5 but I rounded down.

This gem never disappoints!  It is the perfect store to browse and giggle and pick up fun and/or lovely gifts for those hard to shop for people in your life... or the people in your life that have a wicked sense of humor.  

First, the books and magazines that greet you as you enter.  A fantastic collection of art and architecture coffee table books, some novels that are NYT best sellers, some fantastic journals and calendars.  There is usually a well behaved and very lazy dog lounging in this area as well.  From here you move into candles- YUM!- and picture frames, bath goodies and such, onto hialrious housewares, fabulous earrings and other jewelry, cute clutches, perfectly inappropriate cards, magnets, coasters, bottle openers... you name it!  Even cute and quirky baby and children gifts, which are sprinkled with a few gold standards.

You can literally knock out your entire Christmas shopping list here, from your gay boss to your ultra conservative mother-in-law, Paper Skyscraper has you covered.

Staff is adorable and super friendly.  Parking is a weebit of a pain.

Great produce for the best prices I have seen in Charlotte.  8 limes for a dollar?  Guess I'll be mixing mojitos tonight!  Avocado for .50?  Guess we'll be eating guac with our mojitos!  Basil, cilantro, mint?  Guess who is eating Thai tomorrow?  Plantains? I just watched Alton Brown make these, and at this price I cannot resist!

Aside from the produce and the ethnic foods and spices, I was surprised that the prices on the American brands (cereal, frozen foods, drinks, etc...) are much higher than the Teeter.

My five year old thought we had somehow beamed ourselves to another country.... She loved it!

This is a wonderful place to get lost in one lazy weekend day.  Their selection ranges from the weird and absurd to vintage and kitschy to antique, retro, funky cool.  Unfortunately, as of late, their selection has not turned over very quickly, is dull and uninspired and priced all over the map.  There were times when I could not leave without that breathless feeling of finding the perfect treasure you had no idea you needed until you saw it, the maze of aisles confusing me with treasures galore, all over the store and me not being to remember them all.  Not so at present.  I am hopeful that the Spring yard sales and Estate sales will breathe some life back into the long, winding aisles of the Sleepy.

I have come here for years.  I had a booth at their old location and at this location-- I love the hunt, the repurposing of goods, the uniqueness that only this type of place can bring into your home... I hope this is just a little bump in the road for us.  I was there-- in and out-- in under an hour this past Sunday (unheard of!).  And left without anything... not only did I leave with nothing, I left not seeing anything that I would buy if only I could... 

Free popcorn in the front and some of the nicest sales staff anywhere in Charlotte.  I will be back and will hopefully be able to re-review my once very faithful bazaar/homegoods/yard art store.

Great dance instruction for children and teens.  I have one child currently taking tap and ballet here and one who took modern dance.  The quality of the instruction is great.  The recital is truly spectacular, held at Queens University, it is very exciting and professionally done. 

The studio itself is easy to access-- behind Park Road Shopping Center, and sells all the dance shoes, leotards, and tights they might need, at reasonable prices.  No running out to Morris Costume shop!

This studio is more pricey than the Y but the instruction is more technical and precise.  I have done both-- loved the Y but the convenience and the instruction at Jami Masters won me over.

They also do a monthly draft, so my scattered brain does not have to remember to pay monthly.

This place is HUGE and full of vendors who have a great eye for fantastic home furnishings and accessories.  TONS of glassware in right now... the new trend is the mid-century mod highball glasses, cocktail glasses and cocktail shakers-- they do not disappoint but they are a bit pricey compared to others I have been scoping out.

Great prices on some stuff, ridiculous prices on other things... this tends to be the case in these multi-vendor homegoods stores.  

I used to skip the upstairs as it usually was pretty boring but that area has really gotten gussied up and is worth a peek.  They have awesome art work in the stairwell and throughout the store.  Their signature candles smell wonderful!

The people who work here could not be any friendlier or more helpful.  

Surprise of the store:  They have really cute jewelry at affordable prices and have recently added cute scarves, as well!


4.5 stars but rounded down bcasue they still have a few vendors whose wares are not fitting for this place... seems like wasted space.

I have practiced here a lot.  Not because it is my favorite studio, it's not, but because of the convenience and because of Adam W., one of the instructors.  And Shana, my other favorite.  The classes are often very smelly, and I have had to leave when the odor is so overpowering that I was able to taste it in my mouth.  The hallway is crowded and annoying, both before class and after. Classes often are so crowded that you are touching your neighbor and getting their sweat drops onto your mat. eeek.

The crowd is definitely...interesting.  Lots of overzealous, scantily clad women who stay for more than one class in a row.  

This is not so much a yoga studio as much as a bootcamp-like atmosphere that uses yoga as the tool for your exercise.

Adam is the consistent exception to the bootcamp mentality.

I appear to have a masochist bone in my body because sometimes a good a--kicking as a workout suits me fine, but when I want yoga-- the exercise, the mindfulness, the spiritual component experience, I go elsewhere.

--They do offer a lot of karma classes, which is nice--
--their schedule works--

WIth a BOGO half-priced sale going on virtually anytime you arrive here, it is a bargain.  While their prices do seem to be slightly less than Dick's, the selection is minimal, and their kid's section is almost non-existent.  So, as great of a deal as one might find here, it is hard when there is not much merchandise to choose from.

I eat here every week for lunch with a lunch group (their choice, not mine).  The lunch menu is changed weekly and always includes Pad Thai and a curry dish (number 4).  All can be made vegetarian.

The lunch comes with a spring roll and soup.  I enjoy both.  My favorite meal is when number 4 is green curry with eggplant and green beans.  It is spicy- beware!

The service can be hit or miss but I can easily order, eat and pay within 50 minutes.  As a parent, I have gotten quite good at scarfing down a meal...

In the summer this restaurant is HOT.  And I don't mean hot as in crowded and covered with paparazzi, I mean they keep the AC at 78 degrees... sit in the main dining room rather than the sunnier side -room to keep from completely melting down- figuratively and literally.

Sadly, the food has declined in quality.  What was once a 4 star establishment is now a 3 star restaurant.  

Go get your curry on!

YUM!

Squash blossom hushpuppies followed by warm kale, fried goat cheese and beet salad, and a house made white bean burger with potaoes on the side.  Delish!  Loved sitting outside on the cute but small patio-- great people watching!  Love the cucumber water.

The veggie burger, while delicious, was way too big to eat as a burger.  The dipping sauce for the squash blossom hushpuppies was a bit disappointing.

Service was great.  Patio is cute; interior is small but quaint.

I am a salon girl but my stylist has always said that barbers are the best trained in their craft.  I took my four year old daughter here one afternoon after she insisted for hours that she wanted a haircut.  She went in with a hairstyle I would lovingly call 'bird's nest' and came out with an adorable and well done bob. She did not mind the no-frills atmosphere. There was a local anchorman and an elderly gentleman getting their hair did, too.  Old-school barber with friendly service at a great price... ($15 without tip) and a dumdum lollipop? Good stuff.

--we were walk-ins and did not wait but they did get busier while we were there with people who had appointments--

We have used tham a lot and they have never disappointed!  They take care of our deaf puppy, a big mutt dog, a bunny rabbit and 2 chickens for us.  They text us to tell us how everyone is doing and leave a lenghty note after each visit.  They also water plants and get our mail!

We have been thrilled with Little Friends!  They called this morning to tell us one of our chickens was missing (she wasn't, just has switched coops).  I appreciate their thoroughness and the attention they lavish on our pets.

Much less expensive than boarding, much happier animals, too!  They also have been wonderful at helping us "last minute" because, fortunately or unfortunately, that is how we roll sometimes...

I love this hidden gem which also happens to be the oldest farmer's market in Mecklenburg county.  It is full of locally grown delicious produce!  Heirloom tomatoes, big boys, hot house, purple Cherokees... you name it, they have it.  In addition to the corn, peppers, peaches, berries, eggplants, etc... they also have jams and local baked goods.  Lastly, the Beverly's Gourmet meals to go are divine!  Vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options available.  The tomato pie is fabulous!  These are great meals to drop off when you have signed up to bring a meal to a friend and cannot find the time for homemade... these meals are homemade, just not in your kitchen!

They take a debit card.

Located next to CMC-Main, park in rear.

Dr. Plonk is fabulous!  Seriously, if you are on the hunt for a pediatrician, he is truly amazing. Providence Pediatrics has moved since we started going to them, but our loyalty to Dr. Plonk is unwavering and I drive past several other pediatrics offices to get there (which, admit idly is a pain)... but, his kind bedside manner and his trust in a "mother's intuition", with his own dose of intuition has worked wonderfully for our family of three daughters.

He has called to check in on a very sick child, offering to work with our health care provider for in-home nursing care if we got too overwhelmed-- this all on a Saturday.  He called every day for a week to check on her (and us).  He has reassured a desperate mother that her unruly child was just "spirited" and "strong willed."  

His father was a country doctor and Dr. Plonk has that same genuine care and concern that I imagine (and have heard) that his father had.  

Unfortunately, we have had some medical bumps along the way and Dr. Plonk has helped us navigate through these tough times.  

Beth Haynes is also tremendous at this practice.

Dr. Plonk is 5-plus stars and their practice is, too.

I love Charlotte Yoga!  This is a friendly yoga studio without the pretense of some other studios.  The instructors are great-- Rowena, Angie and Jaime are my favorites.  And, when you go to a $5 class, not only are you getting a great class but also a great value!

The studio itself is clean, and has a lot of natural light streaming in from the floor to ceiling windows, which I like during my practice.  I feel a little claustrophobic in a hot studio that doesn't have windows.

The bathrooms are adequate (well the women's bathroom, did not check out the men's) with showers.  The hall does get crowded during class changes, but most studios have this issue.  They also have filtered water, fill up before you get into class!

The power classes that are offered after a hot class are little too hot, or I would give 5-stars.  Several times the classes that are advertised as "in an 85 degree room" have been in a 100 degree + room (I check the thermostat because I always wonder if something is wrong with me when my practice seems harder than normal!).  I have heard several people comment/complan about this issue.  Believe me, there is quite a difference between 85-87 degrees and 100 degrees!

This place is overflowing with friendly yogis.  My husband, who was really intimidated by the whole yoga thing, loves this place!  My top 2 studio in Charlotte.

Unfortunately, my family has spent a fair amount of time here and we have always had a wonderful experience, although the wait, on occasion, is unbearable... but, if you show up with a toddler profusely bleeding while wearing a swimsuit (mother and daughter), mercifully, they usher you back pretty quickly.  They were hesitant to stitch up my daughter as the laceration was on her face, and they wanted a pediatric plastic surgeon to do it, but, as she had already had stitches in the EXACT same spot twice-- one of those times being at a clinic in a county that did not have a plastic surgeon, I assured them that plastic surgery to repair the scar was probably in her future, and asked them to sew her up .  They were compassionate and kind.  I appreciated it immensely!  They have diagnosed pneumonia, removed a bead from a nose, lacerated an infected toe, given breathing treatments for asthma, etc...

Our family of five got the Latin Combo-- full rotisserie chicken, fried plantains, salad, yucca, rice and beans.  All was delicious! The salad, topped with avocado and dressed with a tangy ( read mouthwatering) dressing was delicious! The plantains were perfect.  The rice and beans were fantastic.  Yucca dipped in the hot sauce... Divine!  My hubs and children devoured the chicken... Rave reviews- even from picky miss.  We had leftovers and, seriously, for a family of five to eat this delicious meal for a whopping $2600. almost made me feel guilty. Almost.

We also had the tostones and guacamole as an appetizer. Perfectly fried. Tons of well made guacamole.  We may have found our Sunday night supper spot!

Small interior. I would not bring really young or really loud children here.

Great Christmas trees and awesome horse drawn carriage ride to the barn!

This place is fantastic.  We have strawberry picked here, gone to the pumpkin patch, had a four-year old's birthday party here , ridden ponies, milked cows, gone on hay rides, made smores, and fed sheep and goats. 

These fine people have willed their land and farm to the Catawba Land Conservancy to preserve this lovely 50 acre farm.  It is now surrounded by McMansions but one can truly feel away from it all while here.

Easy drive, straight down Providence Road.

BTW-- the bday party was the best, most fun and affordable party we've done.  Strawberry pickin', kickball and a pinata.  Bliss!

What is not to love about half-priced wine on Wednesdays? 
 
I love the atmosphere here.  It is dark and sleek, very upscale.  The prices reflect that!

I have eaten dinner here before and while it was delicious, it was bit too pricey for what I received.  But, for a nice bar and some finger foods, this is the place!  The flat bread pizza with fig, arugula and prosciutto is perfect for sharing with a friend.  I am not a carnivore, so I remove the prosciutto from mine.  The crust is crispy, the figs are heaven!

The salads are also delicious-- the local heirloom salad is my favorite.  I love local foods, and this did not disappoint.


--They also have great draft beers--
--Napa Cellars Chardonnay on Wednesdays is $6/glass... can you say DEAL!?--
--The bar is quiet.  A great place to catch up with a friend, or to plot revenge on an ex-boyfriend (hers, not mine)
--The bathrooms are fantastic!  Love the faux crocodile floors!--
--Awesome outside seating--
--Park on the top-level of the parking deck that is attached to Southpark Mall, and it is an easy walk over... or valet--

Jeffre Scott Apothecary is a lovely little place full of luxurious lotions and potions, makeup and skincare products.  This would be enough to earn 5 stars but the real reason I gave JSA 5 stars is because of Jeffre and Charlton.  They could not be any friendlier.  And they knew exactly what I "needed" without me even knowing what I needed!  

What brought me in was the brow service... no wax or sugar or threading here (my sensitive skin says "thank you!") .  This service is 5 star worthy in and of itself.  

I think I just gave 15 stars?

Hands down this place offers the BEST children's swim lessons in Charlotte-- and I know because we have tried what seems like all of them!

The indoor pool area is great, with shower facilities and a locker room that are clean and a good temperature for freezing kids getting out of the pool.  The pool is an Olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing (like at MAC) but is cool enough for the children not to overheat.  The deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction.  There are several diving blocks they practice on as well.  The seating is great... concrete bleacher-like seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall.  While the area does have a strong chlorine smell, it is nothing like other area YMCAs that have the indoor pools and water parks... my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave.  And, while it is warm in there (thank Goodness!), it is not sweltering.  The parking is awesome here.  There is never a crowd.

Ok, on to the instruction, which is great... I have enrolled a 4 year old and a 9 year old in this program.  My 4 year old could doggie paddle and swim just well enough to jump off the diving board, my 9 year old needed a refresher for the swim team and was mostly doing "illegal" strokes that would get her disqualified in a meet.  The lessons are at 6 week intervals, which is nice as really long-term commitments freak me out a bit (commitment phobe!).  They are so reasonably prices compared to what we have paid at the stand alone swim centers, I almost felt guilty.  This guilt increased when I found that my 9 year old was in a class with only one other child. The instructor was fantastic!  He pushed them enough to work hard but feel accomplished.  And he got her strokes totally straightened out (no more lifting her head to take a breath in freestyle).  We did 2 sessions (one 6 weeks, the other 5 weeks (even better for my commitment issues)), and my daughter ended up in the All Star swim meet after summer swim team.  Which was a bonus, I just did not want her to be embarrassed swimming.  The 4 year old?  After one 6 week session, she was doing a version of freestyle, jumping off the diving board and I felt totally safe letting her swim this summer without having to be in the pool with her at every moment.  

We will be there this Winter doing their little Winter league swim team.  Look for us, I will be the mom reading her book on the concrete bleachers and my daughters will be the ones splashing around and having a blast!

As a member of the Matilda Wong society, I felt compelled to review old faithful... 300 East.

I love the atmosphere.  Who can't be enamored with this old house in the heart of Dilworth?  I am not sure if she (the house) is considered a Grand Dame by historians and architects but it certainly is by me!  

I love sitting downstairs in one of the booths to the right of the hostess stand for a long leisurely lunch on a Saturday, that may, or may not, include a glass of wine.  I love coming here in the Fall and sitting outside, hearing the fountain and looking at the sheep statue.  I love coming here in the Winter and sitting in the really small and cozy booth in the main dining room.  Really, I cannot think of a time when it isn't right to come here!

The hummus plate is a delicious way to start your meal.  If you are lucky the white bean and gouda soup will be the daily soup offering.. it is bowl-licking good.  All the specials I have ever tried are delicious...  But, I tend to gravitate toward a salad or, my favorite, the black bean tortilla (with lots of fresh avacado!).  My hubbie likes the usual-- a grinder-ish type sandwich, the tuna, or whichever pasta is on the menu.

There is a special drink here called the "Matilda Wong"  and it is very, very wong.  It used to come in a smallish fishbowl (think beta fish) but is now served in a small pitcher.  When I say it is "wong", I mean it is strong, it is good for sharing but, plan on having a responsible driver.  They cut you off after 2, as they should.  I think I have aged out of the ability to even share one...

Nice wine list, half-priced wine nights.  This is a fun girls-night, or date night, or parents-are-in-town place.

At Park Road Shopping Center there is a treasure of a furniture and accessory store frequented by designers and consumers alike that is owned and operated by a woman of impeccable taste and friendly demeanor.  

This place never disappoints... lovely furnishings, lighting, art work, pillows, etc... it is pricey, so if you are looking for a deal, come during their semi-annual clearance sale- or check the back, where often there is sale merchandise.

They fabricate orders and offer design services.

My husband and I often stop in here to retox after we detox (look for us at the bar in yoga clothes, often still glistening with sweat).  The pretzel bites and the zucchini fries (more like sticks) are fantastic.  The dipping sauces are great!  The boom boom sauce is perfectly spicy... I wish I could recreate this at home. 

Dinner:  I did not enjoy my dinner.  Get the fried chicken.  My husband did enjoy his buffalo chicken sandwich.  I had some kind of salad-- obviously not a great choice in a bar but there veggie selection is limited-- it was not great but what is great is their brunch.  I prefer that to their dinner menu.  They also offer bottomless mimosas and bloody marys but-- good grief-- who can partake in that at noon on a Sunday?  Not me.  If you can, stop reading right now and say a prayer of thanksgiving.   The french toast, the omelet, the toast and grits, is all great.

They have a good beer selection on tap.  What they do not have is a good wine selection... this is definitely an area in which they can (and should) improve.  They have several specialty cocktails which usually are good.  There bloody marys are delish... especially the bloody martin.  

They have a cute little side room that you can reserve for parties. They have also been generous in the community, hosting fundraisers of various sorts.  Their marketing campaign-- Leroy Fox for President-- was awesome.  I loved seeing those signs in front yards.  "Free chicken for everyone."

This area needed this spot.  Hotel Charlotte had seen its better days... and the face lift and the thorough cleaning this spot got is great.  Even the restrooms aren't awful anymore.  I wish they had left the train running around the ceiling...

This is also a fun place to watch a game.

Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.   

Tucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  

I was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the "what it is."  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!

While the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure.

I love the Neighborhood Theatre... it has kept me coming back for years.  From the Indigo Girls to DSO, the Brazilian Girls, North Mississippi Allstars, and Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band, to my most recent show-- the Blue Dogs and Drivin N Cryin, this is just a fantastic and friendly venue to see and hear a show.  

It gets loud and it can get crowded (very crowded) but it is usually a fun and friendly crowd.  On occasion you might want to get there early (bring a yard chair) if you want to grab a general admission seat (just put your name on the paper and pen you brought with you, and use the scotch tape you also remembered to bring) and reserve your seat... now head out to grab a bite while you wait for the show to start!  Seriously, it is that friendly... but, remember your seats won't allow for you to view the show, which is great for say, a husband who got dragged to see the IG.  

There are seats upstairs that are sometimes open, sometimes included in the GA price and sometimes reserved, just check the show listing.  There is also a VIP seating area that comes with a server.  I am fine to get my own PBR or-- the value cup!-- a big ole, in the case of this past weekend, Sierra Nevada.  Score!

Bathrooms surprisingly rarely have much of a wait... probably because you want to get in and out as fast as you can...but, they do have a Dyson hand dryer (the long one that you take your hands in and out of while hearing a sound similar to a jet engine!).  

This spot is a neighborhood staple and is an anchor to the area.  It is truly local business at its finest.  It also really helped ramp up the music scene in Charlotte...

I cannot believe I have not reviewed this bakery gem, this little slice of Heaven, the sugary wonder, my sweet and reliable Suarez Bakery.  

Cream Horns-- seriously, the flakiest pastry shell, sprinkled with powdered sugar and filled full of the lightest, fluffiest frosting-like fill.  

Snickerdoodles-- cinnamon sugar yuminess on top of an elephant ear like cookie/pastry.  

Elephant Ears-- a huge treat that is as large as a 5 year old's head (really).

Sugar cookies-- all shapes and decorations, perfectly sweetened to be able to eat several without feeling ill!  --- They also make these to order--- perfect for school parties that require cookies for decorating and the mom who does not bake!

Cupcakes-- all different flavors.  Delicious and lovely.

Cakes-- Tizzerts.  Need I say more?  Just the best cake you can put in your mouth... Our wedding cake was Tizzerts, and have had several other special occasion cakes from Tiz.

Thumb print cookies--  perfect for the little bit of sweet tooth, a small sugar cookie/ shortbread like cookie, topped with a smudge of frosting (this is my go-to treat).

I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of my family.  So my go-to is the thumb print cookie but, even without a sweet tooth, the temptations of all this goodness cannot be resisted.   We celebrate milestones and accomplishments and hard days and completed projects by occasionally popping into Suarez and picking out a delectable treat.  

-- Seriously, the made to order cookies have saved me for years as a room mother who cannot bake--

I love Dr. W (his name is long and confusing to spell... let alone say) and this location (downtown in the BBandT building next to the Caribou- bonus!).  He is very patient and thorough and just a really nice guy.  His staff was super helpful in helping me pick out glasses and training me on how to put in and remove contacts (which was awful but not their fault).  They also filed everything with my insurance company, which is great.

I also love that they call and email to remind of upcoming appointments.  I really appreciate this service.

They also have a location on Colony Rd., near the Lodge.

I am a person who hates going to any type of doctor.  They really make this a nice experience.

You never know what might be waiting at this consignment store-- a mirror, a chandelier (their selection is usually fabulous!), window treatments, or a lamp... who knows!?!

This is a consignment store and not a thrift store-- the prices reflect this.

Their inventory turns over quickly.  As a former client and a current customer, I can attest to that!

They can be a bit rude, or I would give 4-stars.  I do appreciate and expect friendly customer service as a consumer.

I have found some unique treasures here, so I continue to peruse!

The patio gets 5-stars.  It is one of my favorites in Charlotte.  It has plenty of shade for eating brunch outside and it is a lovely setting on which to dine.  

I usually love their brunch but my food on Sunday was not good nor was our service.  I had the breakfast pita and I could not eat more than a bite of it, it just tasted really bad.  And this was weird based on the fact that some of my favorite foods had gon einto its preparation!  Spinach and cucumber sauce, egg and cheese and pita... should be delicious.  It was not.  

Our water and tea glasses were empty the entire meal, and we asked several times for refills to no avail.  

They do have excellent sangria and a nice wine list.  I guess I will stick to my standards:  fruit and granola for brunch, hummus and cheese plate for appies with wine.  

--the scones that are served before the brunch are divine--

What do you send to a mother who has decided to drive four 13 years olds and a 7 year old to Florida?  How about 4 huge bags of popcorn?  (Hey, it's not my car!)  A cheese, a carmel and 2 bags of butter should keep them busy for a little while, right?  

If you find yourself in need of popcorn for car trip or slumber party, movie night or school function, this is the place to get it.   

No need to call ahead for the aforementioned flavors.  They do have fancy flavors but you need to order in advance.

tip:  Skip the metal bucket and save $20 by having them put the bagged popcorn in a box.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the beer selection is great, but.... no Guinness on tap!?!  Isn't there a rule about this, somewhere?  That to be considered a bar with a good beer selection you have to have the real King-of-Beers on tap?  Out of a bottle does not do my Guinny any justice.  

The food is bar food but for a vegetarian, it is a terrible selection.  The salads are not good.  HUGE but not tasty.  My husband liked the wings just fine.  

Too many other places with beer selection and good food for this to my go-to bar.  Or to be a go-again bar.

The best massaman curry in town.  I get it with tofu.  My hubs likes the gang dang with chicken.  

Wonderful tea.  Wonderful service.

I love this cozy place in the winter... it is so endearingly ecclectic on the inside: it is small but not tight, it has a great window onto the sidewalk of East Blvd., it has twinkly lights around said window.  Walking in here from the cold, sitting down to a hot pot of tea and some massaman is a great way to spend a lunch hour but an even better way to spend an evening.

--the parking is tight--

OK, the atmosphere is fun and festive.  Who does not like colored lights strewn about and awesome old rock band posters on the walls?  The floors were clean and the bar area was fun... a great place to meet a friend for a canned beer.  Yes, really.  And with a gut washer choice of one chardonnay, you will drink the canned beer.  Or the draft beer- but beware, the Shiner Bock was flat and not very cold. Disappointed, party of one.  Ok, Ok... so, you might enjoy a fun atmosphere on a great street to meet friends for... drinks.  But not dinner.

I had the fried avocado tacos and the black eyed pea salad.  Both were bad.  The bean salad, and I love stuff like this, was swimming in salt and vinegar.  I think those were the only ingredients.  It was bad.  The fried avocado tacos (as a vegetarian this prospect sounded delicious to me!) were, ummm, tasteless. Which might be better than the black bean salad which might have benefited from being tasteless?  The queso was good.  But, seriously, who can't melt some cheese?  

I like food too much to return here.

I love this precious little spot.  Birds, and turtles, owls, snakes, frogs, butterflies... what is not to love?

They will get the snakes out on request for you (or in my case, my children) to hold.  They will also get the skunk out!  Apparently, they are a lot like cats-- and I must admit, my curiosity got the best of me and I did find myself stroking the coarse hair of the injured animal.  The butterfly garden is a wonder!  We also found turtles hidden in there.  My younger (5 y/o) loves the puppet shows.

The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable! 

The little play area gets crowded and lots of inattentive mothers can create quite a bit of mayhem... we usually skip this area.

Bring sanitizer, as little hands seem to find their way into the turtle water.  Eeek!

Once we are finished here, we walk on the nature trail to Freedom Park for picnic fun and play time!  We usually look for the grumpy old troll who lives uinder the bridge, as we cross into the park.

This is a great way to spend the day!

The best beef kebab EVER!! The meat is so tender and juicey - just be careful not to touch the bottom of the metal skewer when it arrives - it's super hot. Make sure to also order the garlic sauce and red meat sauce for dipping. It's a warm atmosphere with a very friendly staff. I've gotten many friends hooked on this place. 5/5.

Extremely disappointing.

This place had been on my To-Try list for a while now. I came with three friends on a Saturday night when it was not too busy. I ordered the beef ribs ($16.50) with a side of potato salad ($4.00). My friends ordered the pork ribs ($16.00), along with a few appetizers.

What bothered me about the service was that they just sort of drop the food off at the table to no one in particular. Ideally, the server should place the dish in front of the specific person who ordered it, or at the very least ask, "Okay who ordered the so-and-so?" and place it in front of whoever answers. Also, delivery should be simultaneous. Two of my friends got their dish, and me and the fourth friend waited 15 minutes after that for ours.

For $16.50, I received TWO beef ribs with barely any meat on them. In my opinion, ribs should be fall-off-the-bone. These were the exact opposite, and the flavour was nothing special. My friend was even more disappointed with his pork ribs, and sent them back in exchange for the pulled-pork sandwich.

First time in a very long while where I tipped less than 15%.

Ridiculous! The hostess seat us down with a major attitude because we asked to seat on a booth. She throw the menu down on the table, and did not speak a word to us. After that we waited 20 mins for a server to come to us. The services there was absolutely terrible! If you want your night ruined, then go there. The food was cold when it came out.

Brio is always a happy dining experience.  For this specific location, I've only been for happy hour, but I don't see how their regular menu would differ from their location at Town Square.  

Their happy hour must be one of the best!  They have a list of items for $2.95.  Don't let the price fool you though.  Their portions are decent sized.  We always order one of everything, and maybe even two of some other things.  (Don't judge us!!)  How could you not though?  Cheap, good food is so hard to pass up!

Their service is always amazing.  They check several times to make sure everything is okay and refill drinks before it is necessary.

A couple girl friends and I ventured over for lunch on our break between classes.  One of the girls heard from some of her friends that this place was "soooo good".  Well, these friends of hers have either really low standards or just don't know the difference between good, quality food and junk.

All of us ordered the shoyu ribs ramen.  To say that it was disappointing would be an understatement.  The soup was luke-warm at best and it tasted almost sweet.  Ramen is supposed to be savory, so the sweet-ish soup was a major no-no.  The noodles were also sad.  It tasted like the instant stuff.  Gross.  Supposedly, their other menu items (i.e. gogi beef stuffed waffles) are supposed to be better, but that is a chance that I am not willing to take.

Their decorations/furnishings were quite interesting.  The first thing we noticed upon walking in was their Transformer-like chairs.  They had some anime characters painted on the wall and had some anime show/movie playing silently on a tv.  The place was insanely dark that we were blinded when we were walking outside to leave.  

It goes without saying that I definitely will not be going back.  I much rather eat Panda Express on campus.

Five Guys FTW!!  This place is pretty amaaaa-ZING! 

We usually get the bacon cheeseburger (I order the "little" since two patties on the "regular" would be too much for me).  I love the FREE toppings you get which include grilled mushrooms and onions.  I always  order mine with extra mushrooms as I am a mushroom feign.  They also pile on the bacon which is awesome since most places gimp you on that.  Their bacon cheese dog is also delicious.  I just wish they had sport peppers.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  

Their cajun fries are also a must!  I'm not a big french fry fan (especially the thick cut kind), but the fries here are to die for!  The cajun fries are extra addicting (which is probably why they have such generous portions).  

This place does not fail to disappoint and has grown to be our go-to place for burgers.

This used to be our "go to" for buffets.  The boyfriend and I decided to try it out when they first opened, and found that we enjoyed the pre-divided portions.  (Mind you, not everything was like that.  There were also food served the traditional buffet way.)  Apparently, you either love this particular serving style or you hate it.  We loved it.  Food and service quality were definitely up to par.  They have a variety of food and have choices available that aren't your typical buffet fare.  They also have a mac and cheese bar, which I loved since I am a mac and cheese feign.  I think the thing I enjoyed most was the desserts.  I'm not a big sweets person so I chose the French macaroons and the white chocolate dipped crab apples and strawberries.  However, for the people with a sweet tooth, they have a variety of gelato, fudge, cakes, and whatever else.  

Unfortunately, we've heard that the food isn't the same as it was before so we haven't been back.  They also raised their prices (it used to be $29, I think).  It's now $35, which is a bit steep if I'm not guaranteed amazing food.

I grew up in Glendale and I have always loved Cerreta's candy. I think the Cerreta family has put a lot of thought into the variety of their product offering and to ensure the highest quality of their ingredients. I feel that the candy itself is a testament to another time, the shape, size and taste transports me back to a time even before my youth.  I time I never knew but always imagined as better somehow.

Even though some of the presentation of the products and décor may seem dated, I sincerely feel that it is all part of the charm of this family owned business. I now live on the east coast, and try to swing by the store whenever I am in town to grab a box of French Mints for my office and get a few free samples while I'm there. It's always a hit with my co-workers. 

I also like picking up the individually wrapped candies, from time to time.  I find the factory store to have much more variety than the grocery store chains that also carry Cerreta's products around town. I have found this location to have a few more modern candy offerings, such as peanut butter truffle and mint cookie crumble. Everything is excellent here and if you are in the area, you should swing by. Life is short, what are you waiting for?

I grew up in Glendale and my parents would have Friday Pizza night, where we would get take out from Pullano's. I now live within proximity of Manhattan and have access to really great pizza. I try to swing by Pullano's when I am back in town, and I have to say that that the pizza still holds up after all of this time. It's nothing like the New York style pizza, but it's always really good. They have a thick crust, with a house made tomato sauce (that at times can be on the sweet side). They have a tendency to overdo it with the cheese but it still comes together well. I think it's a testament to the fresh ingredients. Overall, the menu is expansive and does not disappoint. See you guys next time I am in town!

My job was pushed back for weeks and nothing was communicated to me. On top of that I am now having to report them to my bank as fraud since they have yet to return the upfront money I gave them. Horrible horrible experience all the way around! I wouldn't even give them 1 star but that is the lowest it would allow me to select.

Terrible. They advertise the bar stays open till 12am but in our whole stay when we arrived back after dinner, usually before 11pm,  the place was all locked up. The hotel is under renovation too so don't expect the famed Ritz service for the medium future.

Ok next night gets even better we arrive back at 10.30 and guess what ... bar closed. No problem we order drinks in our room and they send us Macaroni and Cheese!

All this for a mere $400 a night!

Went in looking for a good knife, as an Xmas gift. 

Got talked down to by the fat/balding guy behind the counter (son of the owners?), saying the good knives (which were fully within my expressed budget) were for "higher class people", even mentioning every few minutes that all the kitchen stuff was final sale and he didn't want me thinking about a refund.

This literally happened a few hours ago. I've been there in the past, but unfortunately never had the pleasure of interacting with the lovable son.

Dufferin Park is one of the top parks in Toronto. There are plenty of old grove trees that provide shade for the playground area but there are also sunny fields to spread out a blanket for sunning or a picnic. The organization that runs this park does an outstanding job of holding unique family events like puppet shows and movies. It has a rink, a wading pool, a pizza oven, fire pits, a gigantic sand box...for a kid it really does't get better than this park!

Twisted fitness is a special place.  The instruction is world class and the team/community built around it is incredibly positive.  I started Jujitzu a year and a half ago with no previous martial arts experience.  Since then this school/gym has become one of the most important aspects of my life.  Twisted has challenged and pushed me in ways not comparable to any gym i previously attended. If you are looking to get in shape, learn to defend yourself and expose yourself to the beautiful sport of Jujitzu there is no better place to join.  (My previous sport was tennis so please don't think you can't try Jujitzu)

My wife and I came here trying to diversify our restaurant portfolio.  Food across the board was okay.  Lettuce a little brown, rolls very out of bag from store feeling.  Many things lacked flavor when the creative names and combos made me expect something bold.  I'm not sure what some of the yelpers liked so much ?  The snickers pie was blah.  My salad was plain.  My wifes quiche was like a frozen pot pie. I liked my app, but not so much I'd order it twice.  The only thing we like was our butter finger shake, but madison has a few thousand places to get custard.  Our server was nice and helpful, but lacked courage in guiding our selection.  Not a awful experience, but not very good.  Would not give 2nd try.

I have been here a few times with an okay experience.  Today I ordered 35.00 worth of food for 2 people and toddler.  One order was flat wrong and needed 2 sausage patties added to the plate.  I kindly pointed the mistake out.  Pointed to the menu which supported my claim and she declined to make it right.  The person behind me then told her she was wrong and she correct my order.  I left and went back to eat my food with no resolution to the issue.  Then the front desk girl brought out the carbon copy and told me why I was wrong while my two year old is having a meltdown.  I then told her I didn't want to Argue and asked her to leave.   5 min later as we left the sausage showed up and no boxes ( requested 2 times) were brought to our table.  Go to crema and support good service and food.

This is one of the last "real" service stations left in Madison.  The guys at this place are the type you build a relationship with and they take care of you.  I recently had a quote for my truck that was quoted other places for 1500 to 2000.  They worked their magic for 600.  The next day when grabbing gas for my boat and jet skis ( no corn gas available here) I had a lock on my trailer that was jammed.  They cut it off and told me to have a nice day.  No charge.

I want to start out by saying I'm going to give this place a second try for sure.  But if my yelps aren't honest they don't mean anything.   So here we go.

The space and view is excellent.  Great vibe and view.  The problems started with my order.   I ordered the quiche of the day and sat down.   15 min pass and they came to my table and said they were out of what I ordered.   I switched to what's left, no problem.  Another 15 min passed and I went to the front and they told me it was a very busy day and that it was almost ready.  (It was less busy than an average lunch rush at most places I have been in town.) When I finally got the quiche it was cold and blah.   I hope to try again and experience what everyone is talking about.  It stands on 3 stars for being a cool hang out.

Good local shop.  I haven't experienced any racism like jayson and can safely say after LONG conversations with a very interesting owner that they are NOT a racist bike shop.  Madison maybe a bit on the hyper-sensitive side when pulling the race card.

I'm no sure if we got a bad box or not...but these are the most disgusting pastries I have ever had. Four of us shared a mixed box and sampled each one. Everyone of us gagged. One person spit the lemon from the lemon meringue across the room. This will haunt me for years!

I love the powter puff boutique. Everything there is super cute and their is something for every budget. I bought the best blue ruffle dress for $50 and a gorgeous necklace for $23. I get nothing but compliments on both. Sometimes the stock is low, so I try to check facebook first to see when new stock has come in. Brooke is amazing, and super super helpful. I can't wait until my next visit to see what's new!

I brought in two cats to get groomed today, they were extremely nice, fast to book, however when I got home I noticed a huge amount on them and they weren't finished drying. I expected one of the cats to still have shedding, however the other cat  gets groomed regularly. I noticed that they were using furminstors which I have been told isn't good for cats because it just pulls out more hair. I got home and brushed my normally groomed cat and I've never seen her so bad. I think they just pulled out the hair without trying to brush it out. I'm unfortunately disappointed. I will be going back to Petsmart. They did have a challenge with the other cat however because of the amount of hair. She looked like a different cat when finished. However in the past taking my other cat to get groomed I can pet her without getting lumps of hair or not seeing loose hair.

If I could give negative stars I would.  Their pizza is not that great, go get yourself a five dollar pizza for better taste.  They mess up your order, and when you go to call to get it fixed they tell you, "I really don't care sweetheart."  Don't waste your time unless you like shitty food and liked being insulted with it at the same time.

I absolutely love this place!  By far the best salon I've ever been to!  Yes it's pricey, but they disclose all the charges to you before they start their work.  I've been screwed over multiple times by hair salons, but they are very honest upfront about their prices.  I spent a lot on my hair, but I was also box dying it for several months which they had to correct, and I didn't have a hair cut in six month prior to coming here.  Jenn did my hair, and she did an excellent job.  Some may not like that there were passed off to different people, but I didn't mind it at all, it gets things done much faster.  The essentials are done by the person you are originally set up with.  I bought a lot of product, which I was given an awesome discount on, and Jenn put some of the red hair dye in my conditioner while sending me home with gloves as well!  I don't care what anyone else says, I would totally recommend this place!

Decent place to go, only reason I give it five stars is because of the prices.  During happy hour, rolls as low as 2.75, I had three and found myself full.

Taste, like any other sushi place.

I subtracted a star for the attitude I received from the servers.  One however was extremely nice and made sure my cups were always full.

We walk in, I wanted to sit in the back, and the woman who seated us had us sit where an employee was eating and kicked her out of the seat...right in front of us.  I felt extremely uncomfortable and felt bad.  Then as we sit down, a man came out and said something to the waitress and looked at us and said, "You took my table."  I almost wanted to walk right then and there and say, "Oh okay, here is your table, we'll go where they welcome their fucking customers."  ...but didn't.  I told the woman, that we could sit at the table next to us and not have anyone moved or their table "taken".  Her response? "We need that for the bigger parties."  That table remained unoccupied the entire time we were there.

If their prices weren't cheep and the sushi wasn't decent I wouldn't have been back. :/

I'm not sure why there are so many negative comments, I had a good experience here.  The main reason I tried this place is because of the location, only being about 5 minutes away from my house.  Christina did my nails, extremely helpful and nice.  She took her time to get me the the exact color I wanted, talked to me and offered me a drink.  I went in an hour before closing and the receptionist was afraid I wouldn't be able to squeeze in a pedicure, but Christina was fast and efficient to make sure I had enough time.  Another woman (I forgot her name :( ) did my pedicure when everyone was already packed up and ready to leave so I really appreciated that.  It seriously was the best pedicure I've ever had, all the tough skin I had on my feet gone.  A lot of people complain about the laziness of the owner, but I didn't see him fooling around.  A nail lady's phone was going off and he was attentive to put her ringer on silent, and sorting through the receipts with the receptionist. 

Only downside...the owner of the place was there today, and a bit standoffish.  I wouldn't say rude...but not friendly.  He interrupted my pedicure to have the lady check a yelp review (I'm assuming) because it was regarding a complaint and it was in a different language she could understand.  I didn't mind but it seemed unprofessional.  He kind of was staring at me, so I just said hello and he ignored me. :/ I would have given it five stars.  However, I work in an office, and a lot of ladies ask about my nails since I'm constantly working with my hands, and I will recommend this place and Christina!

If there was an option to give this place negative stars, I would.  First of all, you walk in and even in the dining area wreaks of smoke.  So you push that aside thinking your steak will be good enough to bare the smell.  Nope, ordered a medium rare, still tough as nails.  I ordered ONE drink, the same exact drink I ordered at Tex Mex down the street, a smaller portion for literally double the price.  Tex Mex $5.00, this place $10.00 for a vodka and seven up in a smaller glass.  Then, I asked for a side of ranch, charged me for it.  This place is ridiculous.  What are you? Gorden Ramsy Steakhouse?  Get out of here, your food sucks so don't charge me extra for ranch to try and get the leather tasteless steak out of my mouth.

If you want your ice cream served by rude bitches, by all means, go here.  I went in with my fiance and friend after eating at the Thai restaurant a few feet away.  The three of us walk in, my fiance wanted a peanut butter shake.  "We don't have peanut butter ice cream, but we can put peanut butter in the shake, what kind of ice cream do you want?" He ordered the chocolate malt ice cream.  Then I order, then my friend goes to order, and as Sammy the "leader on duty" walks out my friend goes to tell her what he wants, but instead is told, "Oh she'll help you when she's done." and helps the person after him.  I don't know, maybe I'm not sure how a line is formed and serviced, but I thought it was on a first come first serve basis, but apparently at Cold Stone, it's every OTHER person in line...who knew?  Anyway, my fiance goes to try his shake, and low and behold...no peanut butter.  He goes to the register and just simply asks, "Can you add peanut butter to my shake?"  Sammy looks at the ice cream scooper who took our order and asks, "Did he ask for peanut butter?" ....she says no.  Seriously little girl?  We were all there, we had a discussion about not having peanut butter ice cream...how can you try and manage this lie?  So as I'm explaining to this girl to try and refresh her memory about our order...Sammy rudely interrupts and says, "Well it's going to cost more to add peanut butter."  We all just looked at each other shocked and the girl who took our order stated, "My bad." as if she really thought that was a proper apology.  Wow.  So we all walked out.

 I will not be coming here again, just because I'm worried for MY well being.  I wanted to throw my fiance's shake at Sammy aka leader on duty's head for being such a rude brat.  If they were a little bit nicer, and actually acted like they cared because I don't know...that's your job working in customer service...I wouldn't be so bitter about it.  If any of you ladies are reading this, please remember you aren't going to get too far with that kind of attitude with anything you do in your career. :/

I've been waiting for Live Market to open for a while. From the moment I saw the familiar "Live" sign appear in Liberty Village, I've been waiting. They opened in the week I was out of town visiting family, so for a week, I watched from a far, watching my friends post pictures of the various things they had bought, and ate,  looking forward to being back in my hood of Liberty/Niagara so I too could eat this stuff too.

Live Market is conveniently(?) located right near my gym, so I have been here three times in a fairly short time period, and it's nice to have such a great post-workout option, and really extra nice to have a close non-starbucks coffee/tea option near my house.

Both times I've actually ordered food, it's been very very tasty. First time - the chickpea burger, second time, upon the recommendation of the server - Burdock Burrito (Do order this. It is yummy.) Live Market also keeps me in Silk Road earl grey tea. I've had the wherewithal to arrive shortly before the influx of Liberty Village work folks coming in on their lunch break.

I often feel like the best way to tell the service level of a restaurant is how they handle minor errors. My partner ordered and ended up waiting a fairly long time for his lunch order, so not only did they make it right, they apologized, and offered him a coffee for his trouble. Smooth. Empowered staff make me a happy camper, so we just left liking them even more.

They've got Ezra Pound roasted coffee, and prepared ready-to-go items, juices, snacks, and treats, as well as order-in items if you have a little more time. 

There are lots of locally made products like ChocoSol chocolate, Stasis Preserves, Bunner's Cookies, Sweets from the Earth treats, amongst other things. You can buy protein powder, tea, coffee, and even make up. They also have jars of Rawtella for sale, which I wouldn't call "healthy", but I would call really really delicious (since I did end up buying some on my last visit...)

Service has been consistently friendly, food has been consistently good, and I feel like I get good value for my money when I go there.

Things to know: They don't have debit/credit working yet, but it's coming soon. I.E., At the moment it's Cash Only.

Like most Veg-o's I was a little sad when Fressen announced they were closing. Not because I particularly liked it, but because it was the main option for a slightly fancier totally vegan night out, with wine (the other tasty option being Vegetarian Haven, without wine.)

A group of 7 of us went on their second day. Is it too early to do a review? Maybe. So take it all with a grain of salt. I hear things are still "evolving" and the menu might change. More desserts might appear. Anything could happen. 

The Bar Snax menu looks interesting, and the idea of being able to have drinks and vegan snacks at midnight or 1 am, is promising, especially with Bar Chef next door (which has zero veganizable food options at all according to the last time we went...)

The Grasslands interior and drink menu is the biggest change when compared with Fressen. And those are really nice improvements. It's brighter, while still being intimate, and has a more open feel, with less cramped seating. 

Another pleasant change is that the servers all seem friendly, and generally helpful.

Food is very Fressen-like, so if you liked Fressen, you will like Grasslands. I had a favourite go-to dish at Fressen.  I ordered the skewer and liked it. Everyone else ordered the seitan roast or the chicken. Bar Snax menu is the biggest change from the former, and it's full of crispy and bite sized options.

Major problem on our first visit was that we went in a group of 7, which means an automatic gratuity of 18% was added to our bill. But there was nothing on the menu to indicate this, the person taking our reservation didn't let us know, and the servers didn't mention it. Since we're decent people, we obviously added a tip, and so, double tipped. Womp womp.

I'll leave out the Facebook page drama that ensued after we commented about it on their page, but regardless, they did not handle the comments well, and shut off posting on their page entirely. Hopefully it was an educational experience.

To sum it up: Food is okay. Service is good. Bar (and associated menu) is great. Interior is great.

Since this place is one of the Indie Coffee Passport stops, I skipped buying my typical latte and ordered a (vegan) soup instead. I asked the server if the bread that came with it was vegan too, and he said he didn't think so. 

Now, this is the part I really liked. He quietly gave me a bit of a discount on the soup (which is normally 3.95) I thought that was a nice (and unexpected) touch. He was very friendly in general, and asked me how my soup was when he walked by later. 

I wish they got their vegan baked goods from somewhere other than "OMG Baked Goodness" because I can't support that place at all. Please get some Sweets From the Earth!

It's got free wifi (yey!)
It charges extra for soy milk (booo!)

The soup was decent, the first bite was kind of oddly sharp and unpleasant, but by the end of it I was really enjoying it, so I think I'd probably order it again.

Today I successfully made a pillowcase. I'm so proud I had to tell Yelp. But seriously, I love this little store, and I'm sad that it took me so long to visit, but I anticipate visiting more frequently in the future.

I took the Basic Sewing Essentials class on a whim, and now I can't wait to take more. The classes are small (just 6 people) and easy to follow. The instructor was helpful, with good advice on troubleshooting machine problems, threading issues, and other sewing machine stuff. I left feeling like I had learned something that I could actually do again without  being confused. Karyn, the owner, was our instructor and came around regularly to check on everyone and offer help or advice.

There is a store dog, and initially, that was weird, but in a good way. I usually don't like dogs, but this one is laid back, friendly (but not too friendly) and spent most of her time on the couch in the back. 

The fabric selection is awesome. So many different colours and textures. They have fat quarters in various styles and colours, notions, patterns, and other supplies.

Really positive experience, and I would recommend it if you're looking for fabric, or if you're looking to start taking sewing classes.

I ordered a soy latte and it was PERFECT. Just a perfect cup, the flavour was so smooth and delicious. I walked in mid barista banter, which was pretty entertaining, and while the space is really small, I managed to come in when it wasn't too busy and got a seat.

I really want to try the siphon coffee sometime.

I dropped into this wine bar for.... surprise.... a glass of wine. I had checked out their menu online earlier but opted not to order anything solid. Though they do have a couple of small veganish options.

Eight has a modern decor, good atmosphere, and while I was there, a live DJ. There were television screens in the wall playing oh so hipply distorted Alfred Hitchcock movies.

When I walked in it was mostly empty, the bartender was friendly, and the service reached that delicate balance of attentive but unobtrusive. 

I ordered a terrible wine, the name of which I have forgotten, but that's not their fault. I picked something local and cheap. They have a great wine list, available by the glass or by the bottle, so you're bound to find something to enjoy.

The server was kind enough to keep offering to fill up my glass of water at least 5 times after I finished that 1 glass of (terrible) wine. They weren't exactly busy, but there wasn't a moment I felt rushed out of there and it was appreciated.

The first time Merchants of Green coffee was recommended by a barista at another coffee shop, I put it on my mental To Visit list. She had mentioned that it didn't look like a place you could go inside and drink coffee, so I was slightly more prepared for the remote location, but I still got lost on the way.

Unfortunately the day I went in, they had run out of regular soy milk, and considering I've been ordering a soy latte from everywhere... that was a bit of a disappointment. They don't have soy milk, so one of the barista's happily suggested 2%. I'm not sure how that's an equivalent option, but (obviously) I didn't go for it.

Luckily there was someone else there, and he offered me a very awesome tasty latte made with So Nice soy creamer (which is a lot thicker than regular soymilk). He warned me it might be too sweet. But no, it was delicious and a great cozy cup of coffee (and now I kind of wish people always made me lattes with that heavy soy creamer...).

Wandering through their location is a bit like visiting a mini coffee museum.

I'd like to go back again and try just a regular coffee from Merchants of Green Coffee or take one of their coffee workshops after I've completed the rest of my Indie Coffee Passport Stops.

I had a great experience at the Wind store today.

Honestly, the store was a madhouse when I got in. There were over a dozen customers inside and 4-5 customer service agents in the store.

But, I waited only around five minutes to talk to someone, and in a little over 15 minutes I was set up with a new account, with the plan I wanted (at 50% off for 6 months) and a new phone (on WindTab). 

Daniel S was super helpful, gave me all the pertinent info I needed, answered my questions, and hooked me up with a phone number I might actually be able to remember. Everyone working in there seemed friendly and approachable, so that's a plus.

That is what customer service should be like. 

Overall, I was really satisfied with the customer service I recieved, and so far the coverage has not been an issue (for me). I haven't seen "Wind AWAY" at all yet. Surprisingly enough, I can use my new phone in places I couldn't use my Rogers phone (like... the elevator in my office building...)

Once upon a time we came here for a birthday party. There were around ten of us, and we'd reserved a space.

Music seemed subtle enough, and I liked their selection of drinks and vodkas. Staff was polite and friendly, but it was difficult to actually order as we were left alone for long stretches of time. 

Most drinks were delicious, some were total flops, at least for my palate - if we come back here again, I'll be sure not to feel too experimental.

I guess I'm not excited about this place because for me, it not only has limited options, it doesn't actually have a good option. The "Juicy Vegan" is one of the most expensive items on their menu, and when I ordered it, the woman at the counter asked me if I want sour cream or cheese. And I ask... well is it vegan sour cream or cheese? to which she replies "no it's not included" (???) 

Dear restaurants, if you have something labelled "vegan" on the menu, could you let your staff know what "vegan" actually means? Thank you.

We waited about 20 minutes to get our orders. After I picked out the big tasteless spears of tofu out of my not so juicy  "Juicy Vegan" it wasn't so bad. I liked the diversity of vegetables, it was an ok size, but I'd probably opt for Big Fat Burrito or Burrito Boyz instead of going to this place again.

My friend ordered the special of the day which was a Korean BBQ burrito and his reaction was equally meh. 

I wanted to like them, because I love burritos and I'm nearly always in the village, but it just didn't happen.

Like the Crema Coffee Co. on Bloor, the soy latte I ordered from here was delicious. Though if you're expecting coffee art, you might not get it. I certainly didn't, but luckily that doesn't really matter much to me.

They baristas are friendly, helpful, and competent, and when I bought an Indie Coffee Passport here, one of them had a few suggestions for other places on the list to visit (which was extremely helpful, and I'm looking forward to taking advantage of her coffee wisdom.)

There are adequate outlets (well... okay there are six, and I got one, so for me, that's adequate)  for us computer folks, fast free wifi and places to sit. I noticed one gluten free/vegan option in the collection of sweet baked goods at the counter, hopefully they improve the selection on that front. Though people looking for gluten free or vegan baked yumminess with their coffee can just cross the street like I did, and grab something from Bunner's Bake Shop. 

My only complaint is that they normally charge extra for soy milk, but I avoided that issue by using the indie coffee passport.

I finally went to King's Cafe after it was recommended to me by a lot of other people.

I had sampled some of their very delicious appetizers at the Vegetarian Food Fair last month, so I was excited to try an entree. Well... I had the Soy Fritters with Curry Rice, and I don't know if it was just the wrong dish to order or what, but I didn't think it was very good. Fried tofu gluten fritters with carrots, potatoes, beans and cauliflower sounded so yummy but it wasn't.

The only thing I really enjoyed the flavour of was the potatoes, because they seemed to have taken on the most of the curry flavour, the veggies and soy/gluten stuff weren't very flavourful. I needed some hot sauce for sure.

At least it was on the Special Order menu so it was only 5.99, some of the other items were 10-13.

They also wouldn't let me plug in my laptop and were generally kindof rude. so, eh. Not very enthused.

You know, it's been two years since my first review of this place, and often, places start strong and then fizzle a little, sometimes I expect that quality will go down, or the atmosphere might change. Not this place.

I straight up love Boreal Gelato. They have vegan-friendly gelato in interesting flavours, today they had chocolate, salted caramel, and coconut. Fruit based  sorbettos are great and all, but these were extra exceptional, creamy, rich, and just all around delicious. 

I know flavours rotate, but I haven't yet tried any flavour of their non-dairy gelatos that wasn't tasty.

There is ample seating, inside and a little area outside to sit on, service was quick and friendly, 

Go there.

I've been going to the Depanneur nearly once a week for a few months. They have a casual atmosphere, and are generally a good venue to find local food stuffs. Corner store by day, dinner establishment by (some) nights, it's really a great space.

The drop-in dinners are usually why we end up there once a week (or more) whenever they have a vegan one (which is on the regular.) It's always something different, but it has been consistently delicious. The chef stylings of Len (who I think is the owner) cooking something up every Tuesday, Emily Z, or Kalmplex (and many others) make this place just a total hidden gem (that I kind of don't want to tell anyone about, because I want to keep it to myself.)

As people have mentioned, sign up for the newsletter on their website (or connect with them on facebook/twitter) to keep up with the events they have going on, there is always something for everyone. 

The house made sodas are totally delicious (elderberry, blackcurrent, maple lemonade, just to name a few), they also have coffee/tea, apple cider, and soy milks. 

Packaged foods include local mushrooms, jams and jellies, ketchup made in house, and freshly baked buns and breads (often with gluten-free options as well), soups, milks, yogurts, and other small business produced products.

There is WiFi, there is table space, and the service is always friendly. It's like a home cooked meal in the best possible way.

Things to know: CASH ONLY (there is an ATM available at the convenience store across the street)

I love this little place off Church.

This place has  three varieties of sorbetto that are vegan and DELICIOUS. I love getting a scoop of mango and a scoop of the lemon (the lemon is amazing.) Sure variety is limited, but what they do have is fantastic.

The service has been consistently friendly every-time (and there have been many times) I've gone in with friends. The interior looks great, and it's nice to be able to sit out on the patio if it's decent out.

Plus they have a beautiful selection of chocolate (That I've never tried, but it looks great.)

I loved this hotel. High ceilings, and a spacious, stylish room. I kept telling my partner... I like this... I like this... and then this.

Clean lines, hyper modern rooms with a split shower, where, if an interested party wanted to voyeristically watch you bathe, they could do so, while laying on a very comfortable bed. And if you aren't so keen on goose down, they have alternate bedding available upon request.

The service was stellar. More towels? 5 minutes you're swimming in towels. You want a ride to the train? Here is our fancy Audi we'll take you over. You want free wifi? Here you go. You want to come back to a room with a bottle of ice wine, soft music and lit up by little floating candles? No problem.

The included "continental breakfast" wasn't bad either. Not the vegan friendliest of places obviously, but they had fruit, coffee jams, peanut butter, and DIY toast your own bread station. They have almond milk sometimes,  but not during the time we were there, but I appreciated that the server tried to hunt some down for me.

I loved all the little details.  I also loved how close it was to the Metro and bixi stands, art galleries, and copious amounts of patios.

I had a terrible latte here. Bitter, weak foam, and unexciting. Maybe it was a bad day to go in, since I walked in on Boxing Day, and it was one of the only open cafes. I might give it a do over after I'm done with the rest of my Indie Coffee Passport stops, but I'm not in any rush.

I enjoyed the space itself though, that wide open emptiness. My table was covered in magazines (so if you don't bring reading material, you're more than covered), they have wifi and I read and finished a book without interruption (it's quiet). I'd probably go back eventually, buy a coffee I might not even like, solely to hang around. Maybe that's why there isn't much seating, there is a certain dark homey comfort to this place I can't quite put my finger on, but I like it.

While I'm happy they offer soy AND almond milk, I don't like that they charge extra for it.

I went for my first ever float yesterday evening and I really liked it. Staff at Float were super friendly and helpful, and offered me a nice peach tea while I waited for my turn to go in. It was very relaxing.

I've been getting a few questions about the process so I figured it would be helpful to have some idea of what happens when you walk in.

So this is what happens when you walk in.

I had already paid and made my appointment online, so I just walked in around 15 minutes before my appointment. I signed a release form, drank some tea, and waited until my turn came. A friendly member of the staff showed me to the room I would be using, explained a bit about the tank, and some advice on ear plugs, then he left me alone to do my thing. 

The doors lock, so you have some privacy.

I had the last float of the night, so it was 2 hours long, but standard floats during the day are around 1 hour.  They have 5 rooms, each with flotation tanks in them, and it's easy to make an appointment online, which was a major plus.

Each room has a shower, a bench, and a flotation tank, and a robe. Towels & ear plugs are also provided. They have scent pre-float shampoo & body wash you can use to get ready before going into the tank, and a more scented post-float shampoo and conditioner.

The flotation tank has about 10 inches of water, and a whole bunch of dissolved salts (for max float potential), so it's easy to get into the tank, sit on the bottom, close the door, lay in the water, and then open it again, or whatever you feel comfortable with. 

At first I was a little anxious about getting lost into the abyss of the tank, and it just seemed to get darker, but as I found out, it's easy to find the door handle in the dark, and easy to open it whenever you need to. So after realizing it wasn't a big deal, and that I could open the door anytime, I closed the door, and floated away 2 hours without realizing it.

When your time is up, there is music that comes on, and gets progressively louder to gently wake you or get you out of your relaxed state.

There is no right way to do it, but I had a great time just floating around with my eyes open, enjoying the feeling of gravity mostly disappear, and also got some really good stretching in as well. Just be careful with the salt water, as you might expect, if you get it in your eyes - it stings! (but there is a towel with a water bottle near the tank door if you need to rinse)

There was only a brief moment in the beginning of my float when I heard a siren from the street, otherwise, I didn't notice any street noise at all, and considering what I saw when I left Float last night, that's really impressive (lots of police activity, another ambulance that I hadn't heard). I'm usually pretty sensitive to sound, so mostly for me it was nice to have some near-total quiet and no vibrations other than the sound of my heartbeat for a couple of hours.

I think they've got a great set up, and I didn't find their prices high (especially when compared with some other float places I've seen in the past) and they've got a variety of options to choose from on their website. 

The one thing that is worth mentioning, is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out, walking out onto Queen Street at 1 am on a Friday night can be kind of shocking (not like this is a surprise of course, it's loud, and busy). I know I'd like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time. Otherwise, I had a really great time.

Another one of those lovely places that I'd probably have missed if it were 
not for the Indie Coffee Passport.

First thing Saturday morning, I went over there to meet up with Nicole H. for a minicoffee crawl.

I got there way too early, but the moment I walked in, I instantly felt comfortable and welcome. It's the kind of place I could see myself visiting everyday for a coffee. Very friendly atmosphere, the lighting was great, and there was ample seating (but of course,  it was 10am on a Saturday morning). It was obvious this was a local spot, people coming in and out, chatting with Bob (the owner) like he was an old friend. 

I ordered my usual large soy latte. It was so good. Thick, with a cute three dimensional heart made of crema. And I just loved the cup. I commented on it in my head and then again to Nicole H when she got there. It was the perfect size and shape to hold with both of my hands. Also, I was very happy to see they don't charge extra for soy milk!

Other things that are great: 
- They have free wifi (when I went in, the password was on the chalkboard at the front)  
- There is definitely an outlet at the back corner. I didn't look anywhere else, but there is at least one!
- There are vegan snacks, soups, sandwiches in addition to several nonvegan options.

Complaints: 
- None really. It's a bit out of the way for me, but I would go back anyway.

We went and saw a movie here on Telus Tuesday, where we got a discounted movie ticket, and a free popcorn and a drink. The combo ticket was cheaper than buying a regular ticket. Can't go wrong with that. Avoiding the massive price of snacks is always nice.

It's close to the Osgoode Subway station, I loved the copious self-serve machines,  and the seats were comfy. 

What is with the bathrooms though? First of all, they were kind of hard to find, and secondly, for a big theater there aren't very many stalls. I'm glad I went on a Tuesday in the middle of a movie, because I can't imagine what that looks like on a Friday or Saturday.

Working in the Yorkville area, I've come here regularly for lunch. I love the location and the interior. It's a nice break from the everyday, and it's automatically relaxing. Calm, ignorable, music fills the restaurant, interspersed with the occasional loud whirring of a blender.

I like that there is always a bottle of water on the table, because I end up getting a couple litres of my H2O intake for the day while I'm there.

I've ordered a bunch of different things, but the Pad Thai was easily (and most expensively)  my favourite. Nice filling serving, with a fresh rich flavour.

The nacho plate is pretty delicious too, but as some other reviewers have mentioned, don't expect a giant nacho plate portion here. It's not huge, but paired with a meal it's a nice snack.

Smoothies are always thinner than I expect them to be (and after ordering it several times you'd think I'd be used to it by now, but I'm not) so that's something to be aware of and set less thick mouthfeel expectations. 

Overall I like it here. I do find it feels expensive, especially since there is no guarantee of organic ingredients, but service is always good and not intrusive.

p.s. Get a macaroon (or three) they're delicious.

I went to here the other day. It had a lot of places to sit (most of which were occupied), free wifi, but no power outlets that I could find.

The latte I had was beautiful, but not super exciting flavourwise. I've been spoiled entirely by the Sam James Espresso Bar. The one from here, was probably the second best one I've had in the city so far though.

It seems like the perfect place for both hanging out (there are cozy spaces behind the coffee bar) and group work (they have giant tables by the windows) and it's a great location (close to Kensiginton Market.) 

They do charge extra for soy milk, and it was the second most expensive latte I've had, but I loved the space and would definitely go there again. Of the food items they had available, I saw a couple vegan cookies from Sweets From the Earth which was nice.

Tonight after nearly everything in Kensington Market was closed we saw a glowing light out of this new Sadie's Juice Bar location. Yes, it's open and right next to Hot Beans.

We picked up two Tofutti ice cream cones (they had vanilla, vanilla almond bark, and chocolate) and they were of course delicious. Lots of other options available (like drinks, floats, sweets from the earth treats, and soy delicious bars), but I didn't  pay enough attention because I was too excited about stuffing my face full of my vanilla Tofutti cone. (& the person there was kind enough to let us in after closing, and I didn't want to overstay my welcome)

I'm looking forward to visiting them again during the day!

I walk by this place on the regular, and through the power of the Indie Coffee Passport, I decided to actually go in and check it out. It was crowded and very white, modernish interior, with an absolutely beautiful espresso machine. Their chairs aren't comfy and the interior was brightly lit with natural light from all the windows, so it's definitely set up as more of a pick up and go place than a sit down for a while place.

They charge extra for soy milk, and did so when it pushed the price over the $4 dollar Indie Coffee Passport limit. The service was indifferent and the soy latte was okay, but wasn't spectacular. 

They don't have any vegan baked items, though I think they had something gluten free while we were there.  Since I have too many options for really fabulous vegan friendly indie coffee shops in the neighbourhood I probably wont return to Thor.

I'm really digging this tea shop. I'm not in the area as often as I'd like to be, but when I am, I usually stop in for a cup of tea. It's a tiny space, but houses a nice variety of in house made tea blends. I didn't think the selection was really that small, but I think it's a sign of quality. Kind of like a carefully selected wine list at a restaurant rather than I "here is every single wine we could buy ever" list.

Service has been lovely.  The owner is consistently a nice, helpful person, and answers questions about tea and recommends things as needed.

They've got a nice variety of in house made tea blends. But since I'm a creature of habit (at least with tea) I will probably just order an earl grey or a cacao tea probably forever. I like that the cacao is from Chocosol, and that the tea tastes like some kind of chocolate magic, while still being light.

I'm going to have to look into some of their tea mixology classes!

We ended up at Ravi's Soups on Queen Street a few days ago, after a failed attempt to check out E.L. Ruddy (they were closed).

Ravi's Soups had a big group of people waiting for wraps, so that was a nice sign. They had a veggie wrap on the menu, and a vegan soup option. That said, I wasn't excited about this place from the very beginning.  Service was weird and all over the place, there wasn't a line waiting by the time we were at the counter, but he was still frenetic and rushed, but the food didn't come to us for quite a long time, and as with most simple vegetable dishes, I feel like I could have probably just made the wrap at home.

The veggie wrap normally has brie in it, and jut as a heads up, one of the unlisted additions is mayo... so you know if you're vegan, ask for it without, or just skip it and just opt for soup. (or go somewhere else.) The wrap came with a tiny salad, that of course, had "just a little bit" of mayo on it, I guess "a little bit" of mayo is the same as "no mayo"? Not quite.

My friend had the wrap and the Porcini Mushroom Soup and loved it. It's based on an onion broth, and has mushrooms, barley, and truffle oil in it, so it's actually vegan. However, soups all come with a cheese biscuit.

This place, like most of Toronto's restaurants, is great for lacto-ovo-vegetarians, but going there made me wish I had gone somewhere else on Queen that was a bit more vegan friendly with more exciting options.

Before we decided to wander through the AGO yesterday morning, we stopped into Frank for brunch. The server was awkward, stiff and extremely formal (in a way that seemed unnatural), but overall very attentive and helpful, so I wont hold her attempts at trying too hard against her.

Frank has a vegan dish on their brunch menu, the roasted shiitake mushrooms with heirloom squash, which was nice to see. The server suggested a slightly more substantial dish the chef could make for us with braised lentils and eggplant (also with heirloom squash and tat soi salad). It was phenominal.

Beautiful presentation, and absolutely delicious.  But, with phenominal food, comes a phenominal price tag, so that part was an unpleasant surprise.

I'd suggest any of the adults here check out one of Legoland's Adult Nights (which happen on the last Wednesday of every month), where you can enjoy a kid free Legoland. I don't know what it looks like during the regular days, but considering there were kids that didn't want to leave the park today, there must be lots of them. Happy to skip that. 

We booked adult night tickets in advance online, so it was a bit cheaper than getting them at the door, and while it still felt a bit expensive, I did spend around 2 hours running around the park and having fun on rides (there are two of them), playing games, and building cars (and then racing them) with LEGO, and building minihouses with duplo, so overall I had a good time. I also liked the miniatures exhibit of Toronto's downtown and area.

All of the staff was all friendly as well.

The thing is - Legoland is small, and there isn't *that* much to do. We finished with everything quite quickly, and found ourselves wondering what else is there...

It's in Vaughn Mills (a mall), at entrance 4. 
Go on adult night.

I snuck in here when it started to rain and wandered around looking at more Barbapapa stuff than I'd seen even when I was a child, adorable little baby products, cookbooks aplenty and the most beautifully unnecessary (albeit potentially useful) kitchen accoutrements and accessories.

I loved this store. Couldn't help making a little list in my head of all the things I wanted.

One of the folks at the cash was pleasant and even held the door open for me when I was coming in; the other one was pretty much off in her own world. Though this was fine with me, since I just wanted to browse the store in peace, and they didn't seem to care that I had been in there for a considerable amount of time.

A friend and I some time to kill before seeing a movie at the Scotiabank Theater so we went to Sushi Time and grabbed a bite to eat.

We ordered edamame as an appetizer and a few orders of cucumber and avocado maki. Well, we got our maki first, and it was good. It was a bit on the big side and loosely wrapped, but on the bright side, the avocado and cucumber were fresh. The edamame appeared after we had finished about half of the maki.

The service was friendly and we got our order quickly, but at the end of the meal we waited about ten minutes for a bill. Every moment one of the staff would go by we'd try and wave at them, but they'd come rushing past us. 

Overall it was okay. It's a decent spot to go before a movie, but I probably wouldn't seek it out on at any other time.

This gym is great. I'm not sure what issues people have with it, but this was my first experience with GoodLife and overall it was extremely positive.

The staff are friendly and helpful, the trainers were friendly, there are loads of treadmills, elliptical machines, bikes and equipment. Some old, some new. The best part about it, is that it is nearly empty.

I think the biggest selling point for me is that it has great change room facilities and amenities. Unlike the Liberty Village location (that is now my regular location), there isn't a mass veto on scented products, and they have lotions, different shampoos, hair spray, gel, deodorant, etc. There is a hot tub, sauna and steam room, and more than enough showers.

I liked it, now it's just too far out of the way to visit.

I went back here this weekend and had a pretty great time. The staff are friendly, the cafe was busy but the line moved quickly, and our soy lattes were delicious.

I still love this place, and I still wish I was closer to them because I'd drink their coffee more often. Staff are so nice, and seem to like working there and with each other. That makes a huge difference to the whole coffee experience. 

There are no vegan baked goods, but it doesn't matter, because their coffee is good enough to stand alone. (though you know... I wouldn't be sad if there was a vegan cookie or two someday...)

Before I finally moved to Toronto I stayed at the Fairmont Royal York. 

The main lobby was of course beautiful as most Fairmont Hotels are, but the hotel room was tiny. But the bed was comfortable and the room was spotless, and really - I just wanted to have a good nights rest in somewhere a bit fancier than a typical hostel stay.

Things that are great:
- Location location location.
- Products in the bathroom.
- Service was friendly.

Awesome and very delicious ramen!!! I have eaten here with my family 4 times now, and we all love it (children alike).
They have a great lunch special (11am-3pm cut-off time 2:30pm) for $12.99 you get ramen of your choice, 1 chasu, choice of karaage (fried chicken)-fried rice or 5pc gyoza and 1 lemon sorbet. A really great deal! 
They also have a stamp card if you fall in love with their ramen and decide to eat there more than once. 
Overall one of my new fave ramen place here in Vegas.

My first time to get my hair cut and I am pleased on how it turned out to be.  Kevin was my hairstylist and he showed me a picture of famous layers and he recommended for some layered side-swooping bangs, at first I was skeptical since I haven't had bangs for a year.  However after the cut was done I decided to get my bangs.  Kevin was very nice about it and did a pretty good job.

Atmosphere is serene and romantic, salad bar is not as articulate as Texas de Brazil, however the food is just the same ~ great steaks, friendly gauchos but not as friendly as TdB's gauchos, price range is reasonable (shelled out $35 for dinner of 1).

The drinks are always on point and I have never waited longer than 10 minutes. fyi - I always order 5 drinks or more so 10 minutes is lightning fast. XD They're pretty amazing! They have fresh taro topping (yummy!) and you can have that on any drink (if you want). Overall the best boba place in the Southwest!

For now, three stars because it was my first time and there was an hour wait time for a medium/large room, then after we got the room 20 minutes later the machine just stopped.  Supposed cause is that there were too many people in the room ~ maybe it was just that night however I had a great time with friends and we're coming back again this Saturday.  Hopefully it will be a better experience.

I agree from Christopher B.'s review ~ BUYER BEWARE and NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE!! I have a great place that I will recommend (read my review about Portrait Innovations), however, I've been here twice and it got worse every visit.  

The first visit was for my maternity photos because my friend recommended this place (her photos are great) however mine was not.  The service was so-so, the sales person was that wanted to sell but she did take more than 30 shots.  When I received my photos they were all dark and we blended in the background but the proofs were completely the opposite.  

Ok so I let it go trying to give them benefit of the doubt.  

Second time was more than a year later for my son's 1st birthday photos.  This was really bad ~ the sales person is different from the last time and she was rudest person.  She rushed the pictorial and wouldn't allow a family shot because "per company policy" can only take 12-15 shots.  Bogus!! 

I bought the simplest package.  She does not deserve a sale!

Had called another motel chain from the highway for availability, but the place looked grim so we dialed the nice looking Red Roof we passed. The price was 5 bucks less plus we got upgraded! The room was clean and well maintained, the kingsized bed was great and the room was quiet.  The included breakfast was barely adequate but at least there were hard boiled eggs and the dining area was light, airy and well appointed.  The simple addition of a microwave in the breakfast area would have earned another star for this Red Roof

The other members are really friendly and welcoming. I felt right at home immediately.

Venue is fine: staff are business like but friendly enough, parking is handy, drinks aren't too pricey. The room is clean, good visibility with a slanted floor or upgrade seating on the balcony upstairs.

But...the sound mix is so bass heavy it buries the vocals and other instruments. we went to hear singer ZZ Ward, could barely hear her and none of the keys, guitar, etc. It was ALL bass guitar and kick drum.

Maybe for a DJ that is a great mix but a singers voice should be featured not unintelligible.

It was so bad we left early. wasted $, wasted evening.

Sheesh.

Bad sound mix/excessive volume ruined two visits.

Great looking new venue with fabulous possibilities. 

Reminiscent of the iconic Fillmore in SF.

Two shows later, the muddy sound mix with excessive volume drowning out vocals left a lot of room for improvement.

Seems a Live Nation venue would do better....maybe they need to hire someone to run the sound board who hasn't lost their hearing.

Terrible customer Service/Service refund refusal:

Three trips to the store and two home visits by service staff it was determined the internet extender network could not perform as advertised.

While, Frys was willing to refund the purchase price of the materials, the service manager refused to refund the $100 service/installation charge...even though their staff could not successfully install the equipment....concluding there was a design flaw preventing successful installation.

Even after a store visit, the manager continued to refuse to refund the service charge for their unsuccessful work.

Is it any wonder this chain is experiencing difficulties? This customer is not returning.

Mike showed up on time.  He gave me a price over the phone,  but said we could negotiate up or down depending on what I had.  I should have rented a truck from Home Depot since it was only a pickup load size and weight. The cost would have been less than 1/2 the $200 he charged me.  I tried negotiating with him but no luck,  so I gave up. Wouldn't use again. Ron

After reading a description of this restaurant in the newspaper, I was very excited to take my mother, daughters, and sister for brunch. We were all very disappointed in both the food and the service. It took an hour to get our food.  My sister and I both ordered a medium rare cheeseburger that came out well done and dry. The burgers had no sauce, and were mediocre. My mother ordered pancakes, and they were rather dense and tasteless.  We agreed that none of us will be returning to this restaurant.

Service: Our food took a while to arrive but they all came around the same time. 

Food: I liked the dosa and curries. My mango lassi was room temperature.

I tried the beef brisket, pulled pork and butter chicken pies. My favourite was the pulled pork but they were all good. Each pie is hearty and the pastry was flakey. There was plenty of filling so one pie would be more than enough for me. 

The place is on a side road, tucked in the lower level. There are 2-3 stool seats inside but a couple larger tables outside. 

Frozen pies can also be bought and reheated later. The to-go box includes instructions on how to reheat the pies.

Got the lap cheung (Chinese sausage) and seaweed egg waffle and matcha ice cream. The soft serve ice cream was very creamy and while it was good, I didn't think it needed to be incorporated with the waffle.

The lap cheung waffle was an interesting mix of sweet and savoury. There was no line up when we went at night and the waffle was made well. Not underdone or overdone.

Wasn't going to come because of all the hype and most likely won't be back unless I happen to be in the area.

I liked my thin noodles and beef short ribs. The broth wasn't oily which was good. The tofu snack was ok, but not a must-get. 

I thought the shaved noodle was slightly too al dente for me but overall it was fine.

There's a Presotea inside but I didn't get anything this time.

Ordering from and iPad was easy and convenient for those who don't speak Mandarin. The menu is available in English and Chinese.

1) Margherita pizza ($10)
Nice thin crust with a good amount of cheese. Made in a stone oven. 

2) Broccolini and sausage pasta ($13)
Linguini was al dente, generous amount of sausage and broccolini. Good portion. 

The restaurant is a nice space. The decor was well done. The prices are a bit high for lunch but for dinner, this would be a good option.

1. Grabong ($10): Deep fried battered squash fritters with a garlic tamarind dip
- I really like this as an appetizer. The tangy dip complements the sweet squash well.

2. Gaeng Kiaw Wan in a coconut ($15): Green curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers and coconut milk. Served in a coconut with rice. Choice of: chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, fish, tofu or veggies.
- Lots of meat in the curry. Good for sharing.

3. Khao Pla Tawt ($14): Crispy basa fillet with oyster sauce, crispy shallots served with 2 sauces: fresh chilli sauce and tangy tamarind sauce
- I loved this because the fish was crispy the entire time and it wasn't greasy.

4. Khao Soi with beef ($14): Fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander and green onions. Choice of braised beef, chicken breast or chicken drumsticks
- Consistently good dish from Chef Nuit. The golden curry is flavourful and rich but not heavy. Braised beef was tender. 

5. Papaya salad - salted crab ($10): Shredded green papaya, tomato, long green beans, garlic, red chilli, tamarind juice, fish sauce, coconut sugar and freshly squeezed lime
- The salted crab tasted like sashimi and though the claws were small, they were very salted which balanced out the rest of the salad. 

6. I Moo Ping ($10): Northern Thai Street Grilled Pork on a skewer
- 3 skewers

The squared pies and the box it comes in makes it easy to eat on the go. 

I tried the jalapeño chicken and chicken pot pies in the big size. They were filling but the small ones would've been a great snack. 

There are about 15-20 seats inside and the decor is math (pi) and science themed. Each table also had a photo of famous mathematicians.

We went on a Sunday around 1pm and had to wait for about 10min for a table of 2. 

We ordered the eggs Benny on a donut and the stuffed french toast. I loved the ricotta stuffed French toast because the ricotta made it lighter than cream cheese. 

The donut in the eggs Benny was a nice change to the usual English muffin. The sweetness of the donut balanced the peameal. 

I would definitely go back for brunch and get some donuts to go.

We were hungry and didn't want to wait for a table at Sushi House a few doors down. 

Grilled duck breast ($8 for 5 thin slices): It was overdone so it was dry and a bit tough. 

Katsu don ($10): The rice was too burnt on arrival and it tasted a bit too salty. There was a lot of rice and not a lot of chicken. 

Raku roll ($13): Their signature roll was small. Inside was white fish, crab meat and cucumber. The spicy sauce was good. We could taste the torched flavour (aburi).

The prices are good, the food is authentic and the portions are big.

The laksa is flavourful and quite spicy (even when we ordered as mild as possible). 

I liked the durian shake because I could taste the durian. This is definitely not for everyone.

Only a few seats available so it's best to get it to go. 

Call and order ahead because there is usually a wait, especially around lunch time.

Went on a weeknight and didn't have to wait for 2 seats. 

Squid ink/portobello 
Interesting flavours and filling despite the size if the dish. 

Offal sausage
Tastes similar to Chinese sausage. This almost seemed like a breakfast dish because it had an egg on top. 

Cannoli and waffle 
So good. The citrus flavour of the cannoli was light and refreshing. The waffle wasn't too sweet so I definitely could've had more than 1.

The venue looks nice. The food was decent for a wedding of over 250 people. The lounge area was very cold even when the room was full. 

The staff was ok. Not too attentive but given the size of the wedding, it's understandable that they are constantly occupied. They took away our champagne glasses after one toast so we didn't have them to toast for the rest of the night. Not a huge deal but wasn't sure why they did that.

I ordered a vermicelli bowl with 2 toppings (fried meat ball and spring roll) for $6.99. The spring roll was pretty small and it was mostly taro in it. There weren't a lot of noodles so the portions were on the smaller side. 

The tom yum noodle soup was spicy but the portion was ok. 

We wanted to order a sago dessert and were told that the kitchen was too busy to make it. The restaurant was less than half full and it was 8:30pm so we didn't think our request was too much. We understood that there was only 1 server but we would have been ok with waiting a bit for dessert instead of being denied completely. 

We will not be back.

The food was similar to a homecooked version I've had so I liked it. 

The restaurant's decor is modern and definitely stands out from the rest of the ones in the plaza. 

To order, you pay at the counter and find a table until your food is ready. There's a bit of confusion when the bell is rung because no one knows whose meal it is until you go up to check.

Overall, not a bad lunch spot but probably won't be on our regular rotation.

I've been looking for a pho place that serves bún with this exact combination: spring roll, grille meat ball and shrimp on sugar cane. Finally found it here. 

2) Pho 
Broth was clear and light but still flavourful. Good amount of meat. 

3) Jackfruit milkshake 
Contains real jackfruit, not too blended so you could still feel the fruit. 

Restaurant was still 3/4 full on a Sunday night with a thunderstorm on the way. 
Service was fine, milkshake came at the me of our meal but maybe they were too busy or forgot. 

Would return here.

Our server was friendly and attentive. 

The store is very small with only 2 tables of 4 seats. 

Free delivery available over $20 and within the delivery area. 

The 7.99 deal is great and hopefully they can keep it.

Bangcakes - $12 (Only at the Liberty Village location) 
Fluffy pancakes + caramelized banana + coconut + peanut brittle + pineapple
I don't love pancakes but I enjoyed these. The caramel sauce was a bit heavy by the end but we did dip into it generously

Corned beef + sweet potato hash + poached eggs + hollandaise - $15
I'm glad we shared this one. It was pretty good but it would've been too rich and heavy for me to consume by myself

Service 
Our server was good. She came by at the right times, not too often but not rarely seen either.

Reservations
I made a reservation through OpenTable but it didn't count towards any points. Too bad because it was the only reason I used OpenTable.

Menu/prices
The price was about expected for the Liberty Village area. If I go back for brunch, I'd want to try the French toast (duck confit) or the pork belly fried rice.

The reception room was small so it's great for an intimate wedding. The lighting is mixed due to big windows on one end of the room. 

The staff was accommodating and took care of us (wedding photographers). The food was made well. Chicken was not dry and vegetables were fresh.

The space is very small but it's nice for groups of 2-4 (we had 3 in our group). The team is friendly and helpful when answering questions about the menu. I don't have a favourite dish but I liked parts of the ones we ordered. 

1) BBQ shrimp nachos: guacamole, tamatillo, chilli jazz

- The nachos were really crispy and overall I liked this as an appetizer.

2) Patty melt burger: grilled cheese, fried onions + French fries, chili mayo

- I love thin/shoestring fries because it reminds me of McDonald's fries :) The patty was juicy and thick. 
- I liked the grilled cheese, especially the bread. The chilli mayo had a hint of pear which was pretty interesting.

3) Fried chicken: sour pickle brine, warm mushrooms and potato salad, soft egg

- The fried chicken skin was similar to Kentucky Fried Chicken and the meat was very tender and juicy.

- The vegetables were ok...I'm just glad there were some greens. If you don't like mustard, you may want to avoid the veggies (notice all the mustard seeds)

The French toast was thick (only finished 1 of he 2 slices) and the maple syrup has citrus flavours in it which may not be everyone's cup of tea but I liked it because it cut the sweetness.

Overall:

I called to make an appointment at the Yonge location but it was full so I was referred to the Eglinton location.

I called the day of my appointment to notify them that we would be late for our 1pm  massage and they said it was fine, as long as we got there by 1:30. When I arrived (before 1:30), the girl said they aren't able to do our treatment but to come back at 3, which we couldn't. We told them we called and they said it was fine if we were half an hour late. 

She showed us their handwritten agenda of the day, it turns out we were not even booked and there was another appointment booked at the same time. The girl at the Eglinton location said that the Yonge location takes their calls and makes the appointments. I called the manager and told her what had happened and she tried to convince us to go to the Yonge location to be treated right away. We were on a tight schedule so we couldn't but after this experience, we will not be trying to go back again.

The Asian fusion aspect of the menu was not great.

1. Crab/avocado salad:
- Not bad but nothing special. Expensive for half an avocado and crab.

2. Lamb/duck prosciutto dumplings 
- Loaded with meat, crispy skin. I liked this one.

3. Taro fries
- The crispy ones were good but the thicker fries were chewy.

4. Ribs
- Expensive for 2 pieces of ribs. Very saucy and tender but wouldn't recommend this.

5. Steamed black cod
- Fish came in 2 pieces of aluminum foil. The small piece of fish was sitting in a pool of soup. The truffle oil was unnecessary and overpowering. Wouldn't recommend this. 

Overall:
We won't be returning due to the mediocre food and service.

Noodles had good texture (not mushy). A lot of vegetables and a variety. The base was not spicy nor ketchupy. They put a lot of peanuts on top which I like. 

2) Thai iced tea - $3 
Cheaper than most places but it is smaller. Either the tea was brewed stronger or there was less evaporated milk because the tea was darker than usual and not as sweet. It was different than other places but still good though. 

Small restaurant, 20 or so seats. It was mostly empty on a Sunday night so we didn't have to wait and the service was good.

Chicken Teriyaki Don (not Bentoh) comes with miso soup and salad. Bentoh comes with gyoza too. 
- Chicken was a bit burnt and dry
- There was enough teriyaki sauce to cover the chicken and rice 

Service was good. Very friendly staff that spoke English well. Decor is much more modern than the restaurant that was there before, Tako Sushi.

Kaki Furai (Deep fried oysters) - $8
I don't love oysters but I actually liked this. The batter was crispy and thin and the oysters weren't dried out.

6-pack - $12
The outside of the nori was encrusted with...I want to say it was panko. It didn't look like deep fried sushi rice on the outside to me.

Spicy tuna 2 styles - $6
The pieces on the far left/right were spicy and the inside pieces were plain. Reminded me of bruschetta. But better.

Wild Jumbo Shrimp Tempura - $8
I don't mind wasabi but I wish it was on the side. Otherwise, I liked the big shrimp and the batter.

Mini Okonomiyaki - $6
Nothing spectacular, but a bit too much bonito flakes

Yaki Scallop - $12
These scallops were too dry for my liking.

Salmon on rice in soup - ?
That's literally what it was to me. The broth was interesting. At the end of each bite, there was a floral scent. It was like flower-scented soup. Not bad, but just unexpected.

Service
The staff was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. It would've been nice if they had told us which dish was which without being asked.

Reservations
We had to call a few times before getting through to book a reservation. The deal said that reservations had to be made 24 hours in advance but we called in the afternoon and got a seat for 7pm. The place was pretty empty when we got there but was almost full by the time we left around 9. We assumed it would be busier later on as it was more of a late night eats place (5pm-2am).

Menu/prices
I probably wouldn't go back if I didn't have a group deal like the one we had. We ordered 8 dishes and a beer. The total was just shy of $70 so we each ended up paying around $20 (for the coupon itself and tax+tip).

When I was looking for the menu online, most of the information out there was out of date. The prices have gone up $2-3.

Spicy pork neck tacos ($10 for 2 tacos)
I liked the amount of meat and cabbage in the tacos.

Spicy pork buns ($9) - 1 burger cut into quarters
I liked that the buns were soft. We tasted the same spicy sauce in the tacos as the tacos. It was good but didn't jump out at me.

Soo yook - 48-hour braised beef ($12)
I'd skip this one

"Galbi ssäm" set - short rib ($20)
I liked the galbi. Flavourful and not too much fat (I usually leave the fat behind).

Service
Our server could've been more friendly/pleasant. She wasn't rude but didn't appear very welcoming either. Maybe that's the casual vibe they're going for?

Combos come with miso soup, salad and jap chae (glass noodles). The fish/pork cutlets are huge and a lot of rice accompanies it. 

This is one of my go-to spots for lunch in St. Clair Centre. It's located in the food court, lower level. Tucked away behind a Chinese fast food place.

Food: 
Lunch specials ranged from $7-9
Thai iced tea was $3.50 but we found it a bit watered down (not as much condensed milk or tea flavour as we would've liked)
Pad Thai: sweet and sauce and not ketchup based
Khao Soi: the noodles didn't seem like egg noodles but the overall flavour was good. There was some spice to it which we liked. The beef was ok, not too dry like most places. 

Service: 
We experienced good service and had no complaints. Our server patiently explained the items we weren't familiar with. 

Parking:
We went on a Sunday for lunch and there was ample parking in the small plaza's lot. 

Overall: we would go back to try some other dishes.

I thought the the name of the place was clever. The words "noodle" and "face" sound the same in Cantonese. And repeating a noun in Cantonese is somhow parents would talk to their children. 

1. Jiajiang mien
- Not a lot of jiajiang sauce

2. Spicy noodles
- Noticeable amount of heat. Definitely big enough to share between 2 people with an average appetite. 

Overall:
Would rather head to Chinatown for noodles. Not a lot of seats, looked like under 50.

I come here regularly and usually order the Pad Thai or Bun (vermicelli) with shrimp on sugar cane, grilled pork and Vietnamese sausage. 

The Pad Thai is large enough for me to split into 2 meals (but if you're a big eater, you could finish it in one sitting). It's on the sweeter side and not the dry kind. There is a generous portion of meat.

The Bun with shrimp on sugar cane, grilled pork and sausage is good. A good variety and filling. 

The pho is good. Not too salty and the broth is clear, not muddy. 

The owners are friendly and accommodating as we usually come with a large group.

I was going to try out this place after looking at Yelp and then was recommended by a friend. Asuke was my stylist and was great at recommending a hairstyle that suit me. 

I told him I was donating my hair and he was very careful in measuring the length. My wash was relaxing and not rushed. Asuke was detailed and spent a good amount of time on my hair. I was happy with the cut and the advice Asuke gave me on styling and taking care of my ends. 

I have never paid $50 for a haircut plus $12 wash before but since I hadn't cut my hair in 1-2 years, it was worth getting a quality cut.

I like aburi (torched) style sushi so I was excited for Miku. 

Came here at lunch on a weekday during the holidays and it wasn't very busy. We didn't make a reservation so we were seated near the chefs which is also away from the windows facing Queens Quay (could also be because we weren't dressed in suits?). 

The aburi was well done, not too torched. The seafood platter was good for sharing between 2-3 people. 

The staff was great but our food came out slowly.

Ordered from the Summerlicious menu. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the $35 price. 

There was nothing wrong with the food but the flavours didn't complement each other and the dishes weren't very special. We left disappointed. 

Service was fine and the staff was quick to clear our plates and utensils and replace them with a new set. 

Most likely won't return.

1. Vermicelli with spring roll and grilled pork 
- Crispy spring roll, pork was not dry. Noodles were not clumpy.

Oysters were fine. The hot sauces that went with them weren't very hot at all except for the hottest one. 

My smoked salmon didn't taste different than store bought ones. My homemade ice tea was unique. Not too sweet and wasn't l overpowered by lemon either. 

Our server was very nice and accommodating. She made some good suggestions to us.

Expensive Mexican food. Ingredients and technique were good but execution could be improved. 

Ceviche verde
Nice big chunks of fish

Pollo en Pippian Rojo
The chicken was bland and the red sesame sauce/ancho chile didn't add much flavour, just spice. Could've used more salt (I usually don't need to add more salt to anything)

I only come here because it is cheap and there isn't usually a wait or a very short wait. There is a tea surcharge but still ends up being cheaper for the same amount of food as other places. 

The quality is fine..especially for the price. 

There are about 3 large tables for groups of 8 or more. Mostly tables for 4-6. Some tables of 2 along the wall. 

Lots of parking (the plaza is mostly empty).

1. Loukoumades (Fried dough balls with honey): fully soaked in the honey syrup and sprinkled with cinnamon. Good, but probably even better when warm. 

2. Galaktoboureko (Greek custard pie): Loaded with custard. The custard was not too sweet and wasn't like a smooth pudding consistency; it was thicker and not runny.

We had a reservation on a Friday night at 6:30 and the place was practically empty. We asked for a room which had space for our legs below. Service was fine. 

The food was fine. Nothing above and beyond what you would expect. The sashimi pieces were a good size. The sushi rolls didn't have too much rice. My tuna/avocado tartare appetizer was bland so it tasted like a tuna roll without the rice. 

I probably wouldn't come back.

Duck salad - $15
My favourite dish out of the 6 we ordered. The portion was bigger than I expected. A good mix of textures and flavours. Warning: peanuts.

Rare beef - $16
There were 4 slices of soft rare beef. I thought it was ok..probably wouldn't order it again.

Tartare 2 ways - $10
1) Spicy tuna with avocado on a crispy rice cake
2) Salmon with shallots on a crispy rice cake
I enjoyed the tartare and the deep fried rice added a nice crunch

Braised spiced short ribs - $22
This was my least favourite dish but it was probably because I was expecting thinly sliced short ribs (like galbi short ribs). 

Shanghainese steamed pork belly with sauteed brandy apples - $19
The pork belly was ok.  I don't like cooked apples so that didn't appeal to me. 

Our meal came with complimentary dessert (I believe every diner gets it) which was a nice surprise. 

Service
We went shortly after it opened so we weren't surprised when there were a few dishes that were delivered to us by mistake, but the staff was very friendly. Kai came out to chat with us and apologized that we couldn't take a photo with Susur because it was during the dinner rush. 

Menu/prices
Overall, I liked our meal. It's out of my price range so I probably wouldn't go back unless it was a special occasion.

1) Crepe 
- Nothing special about the crepe. The basic topping was jam. Costs ectra for toppings like fruit, nutella, etc.

2) Macarons
- Flavours sound unique but some were strange. Lavender was my favourite. 

3) Creme brule 
- The custard was ok. The brule could've been done better. It didn't taste like it was made to order.

A small brunch spot.

Ordered the Smoked Trout Plate and Eggs Federal. The trout plate had a lot of trout and overall the meal was filling. 

The poached eggs in the Eggs Federal were overdone but the rest of the dish was good. 

Also got a house made root beer which was similar to a typical/common root beer but tastes more earthy.

We came at around 10am on a Tuesday (during the holidays) and we didn't have to wait for a table.

If I go back to Lee, I would only order the slaw again. The decor and ambiance in the main dining area are  Asian-inspired, as expected but also appears somewhat dated. 

1) Singaporean-style slaw

We ordered Chef Susur's famous signature dish, the Singaporean-style slaw ($20) and added tuna sashimi ($10). This slaw was very good. There are so many ingredients but they work well together and it was refreshing and light. 

The tuna sashimi was smoked on the outside and it didn't really add any flavour so I would probably skip that. The tuna does add a contrasting texture to the crunchy slaw. I arrived hungry and felt full after eating half of this dish.

Note: there are peanuts. 

2) Peking & Char Sui Duck ($29): Beijing duck garnish, steamed pancake, foie gras pâté

This is not the same as what you would expect from a traditional Chinese restaurant style Peking duck. I didn't enjoy this very much. 

3) Warm Molten Chocolate Cake ($12): caramelized jackfruit & banana, vanilla bean ice cream

Nothing unique about this dessert but it was delicious anyway.

For the price, the lunch specials are well worth it. Lunch specials are on until 3pm. 

We ordered some specials like ma-po tofu, General Tsao chicken and corn/fish on rice. All were priced between $5-6. 

The portions were good. My ma-po tofu was big enough to split into 2 meals. The staff was friendly but did get one of our orders wrong. To be fair we did have a group of 12. 

The restaurant is small but has 2 large round tables and a few smaller tables. The plaza doesn't have too much parking but the plaza isn't usually packed so we didn't have troubles finding a spot (but we did go on a Sunday). 

We'll come back because of the price and location.

A new grab 'n go sushi shop. Regular price: $3.99 for small boxes, 5.99 for large. Grand opening special, 40% off. Just opened this week so not too much variety yet but regular prices are better than other sushi joints. Quality is good so far from what I can tell. The ratio of rice to fish is fair. It's too early to make any concluding thoughts but will be back to get a quick bite.

I've been twice and was glad that the food was good both times. The prices are decent for the entertainment district and the quality of the food. 

The zucchini fritti was good but a bit too oily. 

Arancini came in 3s and it was nice for sharing. Not a must try though.

The prosciutto pizza was good. The crust was very thin so if you like thin crust, you may enjoy this.

Overall, pleasantly surprised and would prefer to come here over some of the other "nice" restaurants in the area.

The maki sets contain large rolls but the rolls are similar so it almost feels like you ordered one type of roll. 

2. Sashimi boat
- Each piece was thick and evenly sliced

They take reservations but we've never had to wait. The location is not the best but there is lots of parking.

Service was rushed and the staff didn't clear the plates often so the table was full of piles of plates. This was towards the end of the night with an hour left of service. 

Last call was at 10 and the staff was turning down the restaurant even though closing is at 11. 

The food was ok. Some special rolls were interesting but the menu was about the same in quality and selection as other AYCE places. 

Overall, not a great experience and would not return.

Went on a Tuesday night at around 7:30pm. It was pretty full. Only a couple tables available (one was for a large group, one 2-person table). There are a few counter seats for single diners. 

1. Ma Po Tofu - $6.95
Very spicy. No ground beef like most places. Lots of chilli oil. Good but wish it had meat in it. 

2. Pork intestine, hand pulled noodle 
A small bowl had quite a lot of noodles. Not mushy noodles, firm texture. Pork intestine was a nice balance. Broth was flavorful but not too salty.

Decent Indian food. Not incredible, but not bad, either.

I usually go for the lunch buffet ($8.95/person) since shelling out $50+ for a decent dinner for two doesn't give me the food for value I can get elsewhere in town.  As someone else mentioned, they have a late-night 1/2 off deal, but unless you want to eat dinner around midnight, it doesn't make too much sense.

Nothing stands out in my mind as a "must have" or "to die for".... But, on the flip side, nothing is a "must miss", either.

This place has been around for decades. And Coraopolis is full of Italians from the homeland. However, I don't know any of them that eat here regularly.

After the place was featured in Diners, Dives & Drive Ins, I figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. I won't make that same mistake again. The sauce was oily (as was shown in the episode) and bland and noodles were tasteless. Home made? Maybe. But not the way I do it. It wasn't the worst Italian I've ever had, buy definitely not up to Pittsburgh Italian standards.

How anyone could rate this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me.

Another one of my favorites in the Burgh. Kaya has been around for quite a while and it used to be a refueling stop for me on Christmas Eve before diving in with the shopping masses on Penn Avenue.

Their specialty, tropas, tropical tapas, were here way before Ibiza and all of the other tapas bars in town caught on with the idea of serving little dishes. Although, the tropas menu has been substantially reduced from Kaya's glory days, there are still some tasty treats on the menu. 

The tuna tataki (or whatever it's called) - sashimi tuna, seaweed, sesame seed, all chopped up and marinated in a soy-based sauce, served cold and with some crackers is great. I also like the conch fritters; and the tofu cracklins - deep fried tofu served with a sweet, chipotle sauce (a little too sweet and not spicy enough for me - nowhere near the heat of mapo doufu - but it is good nevertheless).

I have never tried any of their main dishes...so I can't comment on them. It's usually 3-4 tropas between me and the mrs.

I rarely give out 5 stars. It has to be incredible food and drinks or something so new and delicious that nothing else compares. With that being said, the Naked Grape was very good time, the place is intimate (maybe 10 tables total?), and also has a decent wine list for the Burgh.

The food was fresh and good, although portions were a tad on the small side, so we ended up sharing plates like a tapas bar and kept ordering until we were full. I would definitely go back for more. 

As others have mentioned, you can sit and eat at the bar, which is not a typical bar used to serve customers drinks before they are seated - it is definitely meant for dining and you can even reserve seats at the bar.

The owners, who were inspired to open the place after a few trips to Italy, were working that night and service was pleasant and attentive. It is a hidden gem and not your typical restaurant in the Burgh.

Excellent dry-aged beef. You won' find a better one in town. And you will pay dearly for it.

Similar in atmosphere and menu to Morton's, the Capital Grille is located on the ground floor of the former Lazarus building at the corner of Wood & Fifth.

Expect dark paneled wood, a massively overpriced (300% and up) wine list, and oil paintings of Pittsburgh's forefathers (including Mr. Rogers).  The little things, like impeccable service by the bartenders, and umbrellas to your car on rainy nights by the valet staff, are refereshing. 

Regarding the food - appetizers were just ok. I'd give a big thumbs up to the any of the dry aged steaks (simple and delicious and the house speciality) and a thumbs down to the Filet Oscar (Filet Mignon topped with lump crabmeat and a bearnaise sauce).  Also, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries (if you like truffles) - these are to die for. Desserts are nothing special - I'd give a pass on the key lime pie. 

When I go back, it's straight to the dry aged steak and truffle fries for me.

One of my favorite places for breakfast in the area.  No frills, Mancini toast, reasonable prices (like $4 to $7 per person)

If you are really hungry, try the 3-egg scramble (3 scrambled eggs mixed with grilled onions, peppers, sliced italian sausage, and melted cheddar cheese) - with Mancini toast (and butter). If you finish all of it, you probably won't need to eat again until dinner.

The 2 & 3 egg combos are also good. Sandwiches for lunch are not bad, but breakfast is definitely a better call.

Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the "unspoken house rules": 

1. Order first (do not try and sit down).
2. Wait for your food while standing.
3. Find a seat (if one is available).

Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.

My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.

Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: "you can either sit there or there", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the "unwritten rules" to us.  An "excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down" would have sufficed.

So, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money.

Let me preface this by saying I love sushi. Nobu Matsuhisa and Kazunori Nozawa are two guys I used to visit frequently in LA for the good stuff.  I mean the really really good stuff. Andy's Sushi Bar ain't in the same galaxy.

However, I must say, Andy is the man. How can you go wrong with a take-out only sushi restaurant inside the largest fresh fish market in town (Wholey's)? Especially in a town like Pittsburgh which doesn't come to mind when you think fresh sushi.

I've had my fair share of nasty fish around town. Even in some nice places that looked like the fish should have tasted better (and fresher) than it was. Then I found Andy. No frills, no bar, but hey, the fish is as fresh as you're gonna get in these parts of the USA.

People seem to line-up for his endless list of rolls - and there are plenty. I never got why someone would order a Fried Chicken Roll. Personally, I prefer the lunch special which includes 8 pieces of nigiri sushi (whatever is fresh that day....usually yellowtail, tuna, salmon and eel), as well as eight pieces of some roll Andy throws together in front of you - like a spicy California Roll or Salmon and Cucumber Roll. You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.

And one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up. 

There is also a decent sized dining room upstairs (paper covered tables) that you can eat in if you don't want to take the food to go.

The best coffeehouse in the Burgh, hands down.

If you love Starbucks, stay away. The is not your run of the mill same old, same old coffee chain ala Starbucks, Caribou, Crazy Mocha, etc. etc. tt is the one and only and it shows.

It took more than a year to renovate this South Side loft into a very comfortable and neighborhood feeling coffeehouse and you can tell down to the minute details. From the real fireplace (I am sitting next to as I type) to the handmade coffee bar when you first walk in, Big Dog is something better experienced than described.

Everything is made fresh on premises, including the pastries and soups. If you are in the area and looking for a really good cup of coffee or my personal favorite - Mocha Bianca - stop in. You won't be disappointed.

Without question, the best, and most authentic, Mexican restaurant in town. We're not talking Mexico City Mexican, we're talking Baja California Mexican.

The menu is quite simple and the food is awesome. The margaritas are small, potent, and pricey - but worth it.

My favorite dishes include: the shrimp cocktail appetizer with chips (good for sharing), and the mahi-mahi fish tacos. The burritos are huge and also recommended - try the surf n turf, wet (red sauce). It is enough for 2 to share (especially if you have starters).

No reservations are accepted, so if you go on a Fri or Sat night, be prepared to have a few cocktails at the bar.

Also, if you are a fan of chains like Mad Mex or Don Pablos, I wouldn't recommend trying Azul. You will come out of this place saying the prices are too high and the portions are too small. 

If you prefer quality over quantity, Azul cannot be beat (unless you fly to LA or head south of the border).

Never...Never....Never consider this dealership sales department.  They should be working at a used car lot in the boondocks.  Run for the hills!  I honestly believe we were racially profiled and gender profiled.  They don't respect customers who just want the "bottom line".  They want to play patty cake and pretend it is negotiations.  It is plastered all over their wall, (literally) painted that they respect their customers.  I guess if you see and read something everyday you actually believe you are demonstrating those values.  SOOO NOT TRUE!  Find another dealership where they respect the intelligence of women and others.

Oh yeah,  they tried to keep us at the dealership, by pretending that we had taken the keys to the test drive vehicle.............HILARIOUS!  

Only thing I can say is that Ruben in service is very committed to customer service.  He has gone above and beyond to help my daughter.  Maybe he can teach the guys in the front about ethics.

One of the most wonderful hidden gems in all of Europe.  You'd almost miss it (we stumbled upon it accidentally.)  The owner is extremely welcoming and friendly, and will discuss wines and offer tastings.  The small bites and apps are amazing.  They'll also ship wine internationally, in case you fall in love with their own label from their winery nearby.

I have shopped here since 1998 when I got back into keeping tropical fish in a live plant environment. after a few year's off.

I like that incoming livestock are kept in quarantine after arriving, that I can ask to be told when a particular species becomes available, that the staff are so knowledgeable and enjoy discussing the hobby, even though I notice some impatient shoppers just wanting to grab and go. 

Reminds me of the now closed Pirrhana on Avenue Road that was run by a hobbyist, or Fintastic in the east end run by Mike.

Harold the head guy has saved a couple ailing fish with clear advice.

Just in case this seems too high a rating, keep in mind that I have seen a lot of fish shops since I began the hobby sixty years ago.

And plant and fish prices seem as fair as elsewhere.

Here sushi equates to much ice-cold rice with very skimpy bits of fish on top. Had to ask waitress for wasabi and ginger and given inadequate amount.
Salad floating in dressing, bland miso soup.

Slow service.

A year or two ago one could get a decent lunch here.

Creative cooking. Modern cool joint with pleasant staff. 

Loved the soft small gnocchi with 'nduja- though I found only a tiny morsel of this delicacy in the savoury sauce- and my friend enjoyed the Ontario perch which is difficult to cook well. Asparagus side imaginatively broiled and seasoned, al dente very yummy.

Overall very good food and a fresh approach though 25% overpriced on many items , the perpetual problem of focusing on decor that costs $$$ to build in.

Give it a try, I will return despite the cost issue.

I am very pleased to have found this restaurant which is several cuts above other pho joints I have eaten in in the past thirty years. 

It starts with brilliant pho broth: here is a very complex , low salt highly complex broth . It reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone White Lotus on Lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years ago.
Anyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth. I had the soup last time which brought me back today.

I tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and spring rolls. Verdict: massive shrimp lightly grilled, lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non- greasy spring rolls which I dipped in Hoisen sauce as an experiment.

My bowl of Bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts, and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balanced.

Overall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour. 

So I will go again though it puzzles me to see some negative reviewers dissing this place for another pho joint nearby. Guys, stay out of the commercial rivalry and avoid negativity! Life's too short.

What makes a really goog neighborhood joint? For me it's not just quality cooking and decent prices- it's the sense of being welcomed and appreciated.

I have been dropping by for lunch three or four days a month often with a friend since the current owners remodeled the former Tokyo Sushi opposite  St, Paul's Chuch (where Tafelmusik plays).

The food decor and atmosphere have stepped up greatly. I have tried many items but my fave is the Chef Combi with salmon teriyaki and sushi. it includes generous sashimi as well. Many veggie items too.

Only a light dinner needed after such a feast.

No friend has ever disliked Maido and my friends are 
Mostly picky foodies. 

Anyway, it's my kind of low-key friendly place, give it a try.

Having read raves I decided to eat at Sea Witch on a quiet Lunch hour. 
There was  only  one other diner and about five staff.

No big deal being served , right?

Not that there was much effort to break off conversation and speak to me as I waited for a welcome. Finally ordered and having confirmed with the pleasant cashier that yes I would like tartar sauce, I was then asked by two different servers if I happened to want tartar sauce. 

It seems that the staff don't pay much attention.

 I told the last one that I had been asked twice already and received no reply, though in the end the sauce was supplied.

Pacific haddock was tasty but more batter than fish and the chips were lukewarm, far from piping hot as they need to be for taste and texture.

Slackness kills reputations, the decor and concept are good but the execution left much to be desired.

Pleasant staff, decent food and fair prices, yet what might have been a perfect brunch on a warm summer Sunday today  was considerably diminished by many wasps swarming the patio tables.

I was told the owners refuses to use wasp traps or even one of the effective fake wasp gadgets that keeps wasps away.
It's not even an expensive fix to protect diners so what's going on here?

It's a matter of time before someone gets stung and sues for damages.

Too bad, but shows a lack of care for customers!!

I down rated the place by two stars for that reason.

Great food at a great price! 
I had brunch there and got 2 eggs, plantains, beans, half an avocado, cheese, and a chicken tamale. I asked for scrambled eggs and to my surprise they added tomatoes and peppers. Everything tasted great! It's a good change from the regular brunch staples.

WAYYYYY too much hype about this place!! Seriously though... No seriously. 

Only good thing about this place is how they are good at making the portions look decent in the photos lol

Service: 
the waitress was no offense an airhead she was so distracted looking around at people seemed to have a bad case of ADHD

She knew nothing about her drinks list or about the food ... Was gone when we kept trying to order more food (we had to order with the bar back because she took so long to show up)



FOOD: 
Tater tots :  meh not worth it 
Cauliflower app: meh over cooked and nothing special 
Corn bread: alright but really not worth it .... Unless you are feeding tweety bird. 


Kentucky handshake sandwich: not worth the price (it's literally Kentucky fried chicken ... Like might as well go there and pay $6 instead of basically $15 to look at some arm ) lol 

Chicken and Waffles : portion is not worth it flavor was alright nothing mind blowing (go to the Kensington market one ... WAYYY better and much more for your money) 
 
Red Funnel cake : save your money .... Tiny over cooked and completely over drizzled with icing ... Yuck  worst thing I have ever had in the funnel cake department.


We ordered more food but honestly don't waste your time ... Just go somewhere else.... Not worth even going on about how bad it was.

Service was really great fast quick friendly but the food was a terrible..... 

Blanco roll was the worst..  it's like someone squished egg, tuna from a can and panko crumbs and made it a roll.... As if that's not bad enough they make it resemble some back ally hotdog by adding pickled jalapeño to it.... Gross if you like fish cakes and hotdogs this roll is for you. If not I highly recommend staying away. 

If they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalapeño over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here. 

Volcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish ... Which is why I go out for sushi. 

The sashimi plater (30 pieces) was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon.... Everything else was off temperature. 

Complimentary salad was small cute and good. 

The miso soup was good. 

Tea was average. 

Ginger is really good here.

Wasabi is really weak here. 


I hope the chef seriously considers the suggestion I made about the less sauce and torched raw jalapeño.... Ja Bistro has mastered it and it's incredible.... Maybe the chef should check it out and see what I mean. 

Would not recommend this place. Will not be coming back.

Always great friendly service and fresh baked bread and desserts everyday. 

Highly recommend the custard cakes they are the closest thing I have ever tried to the original Pastéis de Belém in Lisboa  

The rice flour cake is also really good and a good option for those whom do not like cake too sweet. 


The bean cakes are great here too!  orange, almond, and a few others I have tried are all good.

-6 stars ...I have come here several times....


The staff is friendly. However, I feel they have not been properly trained in making the drinks they sell. 

The coffee beans are good quality however, sometimes the load is packed to tight and the espresso comes out with a burnt taste. Other times in a latte it is either too over heated or comes out like a cappuccino. 

In the simplest way put very inconsistent and not in anyway good. 


Some of the desserts are really over priced for the quality and quantity you are getting (i.e. Small Almond croissant $4.20) 


Today I ordered an Early Grey. The earl grey tea I had tasted moldy .... It also made me sick.... Which makes me question what type of hygiene they have there. 



Will not be going back to this place ever .... They are a disgrace to cafes. 


Tip* go to the Starbucks upstairs in the indigo or across the street... They are closer to what it should really taste like.... You will get the coffee, late, cappuccino or tea the way it should be done.

-5 stars literally saw the 'chef' lick her fingers over and over again while I waited for my orange juice. Then she started setting up people's dishes .... With her bare hands...Disgusting place... Extremely unsanitary!!!! After waiting 10mins to receive my orange juice while almost puking watching the levels of sanitation plummet more and more I was then presented with half a cup of juice. When I asked to upgrade to a full cup I was then told that's the only amount I can buy? Okay guess they don't want to make money. 

Tip- save yourself the nausea go somewhere  else

Save your money for a better serviced, hygienic, more organized and professional establishment.

Really small place to grab ice cream which is fine considering we have more cold weather than summer. The ladies who were making the cones were very pleasant and had great vibes... The person who was at the cash the first time I went seemed a bit stuck up but then the second time the front cash/ barista was also very pleasant and seemed to have very good vibes.... Hopefully I see more of this side the following visits too. 


LOVE the cashew latte with the Brazilian blend  perfection ! 


Ice cream ($6 I would say they should be priced more at $4) was good quality for a soft serve.... It was defiantly not the same quality as McDonald's or an ice cream truck WAY better. The only similarity is that it melts quickly ... Like any other soft serve. The cones could be a little better quality because they do get pretty soggy at the end.  

Love the creativity they have with the cones! I hope they continue to come up with new ideas. 

Small suggestion on the cinnamon one... Maybe add some nuts ... The current topping just seems so plain jane compared to the other creative cones you have! 

Definitely going back to try more flavours!

All I have to say is .... if you're going to get a tattoo and want it done RIGHT and like no other place in toronto go see RAIDEL at adrenaline!!!! 

I originally had an amaZing tattoo artist in Kensington (Vince) who unfortunately moved back to Venice, Italy. Fate brought me to the hands of the very talented RAIDEL! 

His passion for creative designs and art is phenomenal! He has done quite a large AMAZING piece on me and most of it he just did FREEHAND  (That is talent!)  

The thing I LOVE the MOST about his many talents is the fact that he has something that I find is SO RARE in a tattoo artist... he can create that FLOW into making your tattoo not look like a stamp ... but a part of you... an art that can even take previous pieces and make them one! I have about 1 3rd or fourth of my body tattooed and this tattoo SAVIOUR turned my several prior tattoo pieces (ribs, shoulders upper back) and with his new addition turned my body into a canvas with one solid flowing united piece. Brilliant engineer in designing.     

Adrenaline is quite pricey ..but if you are getting it done with him IT'S WELL WORTH IT. If I wasn't so broke ass I would give him a HUGE TIP as appreciation for his VERY hard work and TALENT! I intend to repay him some day by surprise for the lack of the TIP he deserved that I didn't have at the time.


This HARD working FRIENDLY always smiling singing ARTIST will make you NEVER WANT to go anywhere else with all his talent and positive energy!

Quick very friendly service this evening! She was very welcoming and made some suggestions after knowing it was our first time. 

Butter Chix- Creamy subtle kick of butter chicken spice... Saucy very enjoyable!  

Mum's Chicken Pie - Classic  was not disappointed LOVE the touch of Chardonnay really gave it that extra little something 

Traditional Aussie - Saucey , meaty, has a little potato (not too much... Which I really appreciate because I didn't have an allergic reaction to it from that very reason ) 

Surprisingly even though these little guys are the size of your palm they are actually decently filling ! ... You might just need 2-4 to fill you up depending on how much you can handle. 

Price is okay ... About $7 each Palm sized pie. They have 4 pies for $24 to take home and cook located in the freezer ( I feel that is a better suited price for the cooked ones too)   

On the plus size the hand held sizes lets you try more flavours!! 

Would recommend people to check it out!

The only good thing at this place is the friendly staff... The food however is ...terrible. Save your money. I don't know how someone can over cook rice into a mash! The curry was literally just curry no veggies or anything... And I felt like I was drinking curry soup that was much too creamy and not enough spice. Also had the Tom Yum Shrimp soup... Very disappointing it was literally some powder tasting broth with 3 shrimp and a couple mushroom slices... Not a traditional Tom Yum at all. If they had a -1 star I would have put it.

Customer service from both staff today was really great. So I ordered the matcha latte .... Drank it and my stomach turned it is really sweet! I don't mind sweet treats but when it comes to beverages I am only a fan of bitter and sour things.... They happily (literally with a smile) offered me another beverage. I felt pretty bad because I hate wasting but I just can not do sweet drinks.


FYI their matcha powder has sugar mixed into the packaging they get (just like Starbucks).... Which would be great ... Unless you are not looking for a sweet drink... 


Great news! Their soy latte is amazing! Deep rich coffee bitter flavor (which I love). I was very pleased by how calm and positive they both were with me as I am sure that was probably annoying to have to waste the product  More coffee shops should have this type of professional positive smiling customer first type of employees 


Location also has a fireplace which o imagine will be nice in the cold winter months. Washrooms are clean (probably because now they aren't bombarded with all the school children arroyos the area coming in and disrespectfully destroying it and leaving it messy every 30mins.

The pork bone soup is awesome the meat basically falls of the bone! (Perfection) 

The Bibimbap is always my go to dish! It tastes like the best mothers home cooked meal! 

I love how they are always attentive to make sure you get your pickles and such at the beginning and how friendly and welcoming they are. Great place to go with a family, group, as a couple or alone!

Several unfriendly / unhelpful staff. Unorganized. Will not be returning.


Went in to drop off a prescription staff was rude and when I insisted on leaving my account information she cut me off and told me she would get everything she needs when she contacts the other location to move my prescription over. 


I return 2 days later (no phone call left to let me know they were filled). I get there and had to wait 30mins for this also unfriendly staff that seems to apparently hate her job to give me my prescription. Apparently it's too challenging for the staff to process a simple refill pickup.

Use to come here all the time and loved it! 

Service needs a little work but more importantly lets get to the food reviews 

Starting with my personal favorite...

Ravioli di Zio Paperone -Great 
homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano

Tonnarelli alla Norcina - Good 
Italian black truffle shavings, homemade spicy sausage, pecorino 


Tagliatelle alla Bolognese- Great 
traditional bolognese ragù, parmigiano 



Tonnarelli ai Funghi - Good 
oyster and honey mushrooms, porcini sauce 


Cavatelli al Ragu' D'Agnello -Great 
handmade cavatelli, lamb braised in tomato sauce, Pecorino 


Gnocchi alla Simi- Good 
tomato sauce, fresh ricotta, basil, parmigiano 


Rigatoni Arcobaleno - Good 
mozzarella di bufala, zucchini, light cherry tomato sauce, basil 


Agnolotti alla Lilli -Good 
stuffed with spinach, ricotta and pecorino, butter, sage and parmigiano

Spaghetti in Canna a Mare - Okay 
fresh clams and mussels, calamari, scallops and tiger shrimp, light tomato sauce 



Apristomaco - Appetizers 


Carpaccio di Manzo- Great 
hand cut, raw beef tenderloin, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, parmigiano reggiano shavings, arugola


Funghi Assoluti - Good 
basked oyster mushrooms, parmigian, bread crumbs, extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, arugola 

Frittura di Calamari - Okay
deep fried lightly floured calamari

Tagliere del Salumiere -Good 
selection of Italian and local cured meats 
Tagliere di Formaggi - Good 
selection of italian cheeses served with honey and homemade jam 

Insalate - Salad 

Only one I have tried is Caprese and it was Good. 


Pizze - Pizza 

They are well done thin crusts .... I personally like Napoli, Margherita, Bufalina, Quattro Stagioni, Santo Stefano, Da Dó a Dá, Smendozzata, Li Pecuri, and finally C't Mang. 


Dessert ... I always get a flourless chocolate cake heated .... It's a perfect finish for my dinner with a cappuccino or latte

Desserts and bread are always great at Nova Era. Customer service is terrible. 

Desserts always a great variety and always fresh. 

Couple recommendations; custard cakes, bean cakes are all amazing! 


Customer service.... After waiting in line for 15mins with only two people in front of me I was told to go to the other counter to order my sandwich.... After ignoring me for another 10mins the extremely rude woman making sandwiches doesn't even greet me and in a very unfriendly manner tells me to basically go sit down and now wait to be asked what I want.


20mins pass and I am still here sitting and waiting to have someone approach me to take an order. I will never be coming back here to eat and HIGHLY recommend only coming for the bakery stuff only here! 


Terrible fucking service.

"In cod we trust" great deep fried fish toco (but fish portion is small) 

"Beef Cheek" braised and good portion 

Tuna Chive in hard shell toco okay portion ( a little too drenched in sauce) 


We had some ribs "special of the day" portion not worth the price AT ALL ... Sauce is a type of honey garlic (drenched in mayo ) not worth the money. 

 I had high hopes for great food here after reading the reviews ...but was over all not really that impressed.

Not authentic at all..... NOT AT ALL 

Khao Soi ..... Not sure who paid all these reviewers to call it "authentic" ... I am a HUGE fan of Thai food and have NEVER had coleslaw ... Yes that's right ... Literally COLESLAW in the Khao Soi. It is disgusting. Beef was not tenderized and undercooked.  

Tom Yum - the only average thing worth maybe trying if there is nothing else open and you need food. It is heavy on the lemon grass and is missing the fundamental herbs and spices.... For starters galangal .... Had no freshness to the soup .... Tasted like over cooked boiled veggies that had some paste added  choice of meat and severed.  


Curry is not authentic at all .... It is a pre-made paste added again to something cooked separate.... Then served. A paste at a Resturant considered to be authentic should be made in house and better quality.


Service was fast. 

Servers were fine. 

Music was fine. 



Overall poor quality food.... Will not be coming back and DO NOT recommend this place to anyone.

Awesome home cooked style food! What a little gem we found! The outside is a little off putting but once you go in its a completely different situation.

Service was great ! Friendly professional classy staff and great priced filling traditional food!  

Cabbage rolls - saucy simple and tasty 

Perigees- loved the potato ones!! 

Schnitzel- tender, not oily, tasty  

Very fresh ingredients ... Really satisfied our home cooked craving

Butter tarts really well done, they have a bourbon one that is also very good for the liquor lovers. 
Chocolate and butter croissants very well done and properly texturized. Almond croissant was a bit on the drier side 

Macaroons
Matcha & white chocolate - had a strange fridge radiator after taste which I hated and the matcha was too mildly infused. Earl grey has a chocolate filling which is honestly, too overpowering for the bergamot notes. Red velvet also more chocolate in flavour not quite enough vanilla (maybe just the supplier). 

Over all there were a few I did really enjoy and would recommend, as I would select the following flavours again upon my next visit  100% Salted Carmel then, Hazelnut, Pistachio (could be a little stronger but still amazing) , Lavender, Boston cream is very true to flavour, Raspberry, and Chocolate. 

Honestly, the last time I came in but NOT the first three times ... but the last time .... all my macaroons had a really off putting stomach turning fridge taste. As it was the only time that happened I will he going back as I love the lavender and salted caramel macaroons ! 

Have yet to try the pies but they look fabulous along with the scones and meat pies.... can't try everything in one day ;)

Staff taking orders in such a rush they mess up my order... Which I only find out 10 mins after watching the barista mess up my drink twice ... Which she claims 'someone must have taken'  

Then to complete her customer service the barista then speaks to her coworker and makes me go BACK to the line to pay the extra $0.63 cents for the mistake they have made  

What a joke where do they find these people? Never thought I would find such horrible people working at a coffee place as all my past experiences at many other coffee houses have been great. 

Tip - save your money for a Timmy's or other coffee place in the hospital.

I have been here before but my last experience was not good at all. 


The bad - the younger lady who served us seemed like she does not like her job ... She made our visit unpleasant right from the entrance ... She seemed a little arrogant too.... And was not very familiar with the desserts. 
I am not a fan of lemon desserts but I do not mind something with a tiny note of it (as I know a lot of baked desserts often do have a little in them) ... When I specifically asked for her recommendation she gave me an extremely lemony dessert. I also requested a no foam latte and she seemed to also miss that one as she handed me something that closely resembled a cappuccino. 

I love the heart of this place ... It was actually a bit heart breaking with my last visit as I have come in several times throughout the past couple years and have not received this type of treatment. 

The good- Love the desserts here I usually always grab a mix box of the traditional southern Italian almond and pistachio biscuits and am always very pleased with the texture, the flavour and the combination of them! 
The bread here is amazing highly recommend you try anyone of them (I am sure you will love it! ) 

The coffee beans they use here are also very robust and strong which I love.


I try to ignore the treatment I got here last time .....because maybe she was just having a bad day and was taking it out on us .....but to be honest that's no excuse, ever ... And it will effect me to now go closer to Bathurst and collage to go get my almond pistachio fixes from more pleasant staff.

I really love the butternut squash soup here... It's one of the things that has always stayed consistent even after the change of hands after the owner passed away.  


Curry Lamb Wrap - Good 
Has a great spicy kick .... Perfect for winter and autumn days. 

Chicken Wrap- Good 
Chicken is tender and cooked simple but well. Can't go wrong with the chicken. 

Steak Wrap- Usually great but last time was way over cooked... They need the cook to keep a closer eye on the meat to make sure it's still pink on the inside of the beef.... 

The fact that it was over cooked made me think maybe they downgraded the meat quality ? Regardless now I will only be going there for soup!

Highly recommend this place if your looking for a dedicated, experienced, professional who really listens and goes above and beyond to get the job done! Everyone is extremely helpful positive and kind. 

 I started coming to Myodetox after my boyfriend always telling me about how his whole volleyball team loves Boris and his magical fixing hands. I was not disappointed! 

At first I was going to Boris to help with tightness in my hamstrings, hips and shoulders. Results were often immediate and helped me achieve better form and dig deeper in my workouts. 


After my car accident and suffering from some serious whiplash and  a terrible concussion Boris really dedicated his time to help me. 

He informed me on what to expect with concussions and whiplash and how to overcome my daily obstacles while being rehabilitated 

They do a lot of services here! It's like the one stop shop for anyone's needs! I have had Physio, massage, acupuncture, cupping, and even things on vestibular rehabilitation. The list really just keeps going. 

I still have a long way to go but I have made some incredible progress which I owe all to Myodetox! 

Through my experiences thus far I can honestly say Myodetox really will bring back the new you

Quick service ... Tasty flavourful food... the chicken kabob is great and tender, tandoori special gives you a nice mix and the beef kabob is also very flavourful and tasty. 

Salad could use a little extra something something but is fresh ingredients at least for now. 

Great place if you need a quick bite.

Suffocation best describes the services given at this location. The rep was sooooo annoying. She didn't even ask for what we were looking for and kept bringing us what she normally wears in sizes that aren't even our size it was like she was having a conversation with herself or something ..... Like every min she brought me something new to try on.... It made me feel frustrated annoyed nauseated and obviously did not want to buy anything ever from here again. 

I will be going to the other locations from now on to get proper service.

Great selection .... When in stock. They need to get people who understand the products that they sell... Came in several times and it was hard to find anyone on the third floor who could help me with anything really. 


I'm pleased with Micheal's being in the area none the less. I just hope for future hires they consider always having at least one person who understands what they are selling. 

The first time I went in for gold leaf paint no one was even around to help.... Out of all the floors I finally managed to find a representative on the third floor. Once I asked her where I could find it she asked me to wait because apparently she was the only person working and had 3 other people in front of me?! How can such a large store be so understaffed on a weekend morning I don't know.... I was very happy to see on my second visit that this has changed.

They now have many more reps working the floor ...unfortunately when I went to ask about some stain glass products again, I was not able to get the help I needed from the first representative.... I was however referred to Amanda (on the ground floor) who was able to answer my questions.

Service is definitely getting progressively better.   


UPDATE***

Went back a couple more times since and they are definitely getting things more organized! 


I have to say I really love all the 50% off coupons from this place! I don't go to any other places for art supplies anymore because of the amazing prices and they stock is unreal!

Love love love this place! 


Tacos tacos  

Firstly just need to say I put the habanero hot sauce on everything here to give it a little kick! ... If you love spice defiantly try it.  Also rule of thumb *squeeze* that lime on everything ! Tacos and in drinks .... Just go wild. 

Shrimp tacos were juicy and great 

Fish taco was great and flaky 

They had a Trout taco day feature which was great (with a little lime and hot sauce)

Chicken and beef tacos had a decent amount of meat in them and were nicely cooked and shredded. 

The Vegetarian option was surprisingly also very tasty and flavourful 


Ceviche love the jalapeño touch inside but fish and tomatoes needs to be chopped up more for better chip grabbing fun. 


Margarita pitcher could use a little more lime less agave and more tequila.... Less sweetness and more pungent twist and kick in the mouth to go with those tasty tacos. (I just ordered extra tequila and added to my cup.... But I would say about 4 more shots in the pitcher would fix it)

Over all very great vibes...music is beautiful loud and upbeat. Friendly staff. Great place to go grab a bite laugh and enjoy a fun Latin vibes time

Was very displeased as a regular client of Khao San Road. 

I have come here for a couple years... always in person. 

The other day I tried to order take out I was trying to get through for over 30mins calling over and over and over again. I was EXTREMELY unhappy with the fact that I was pushing close to an HOUR with trying to order food. I called Northern Thai and they picked up the phone immediately.

REALLY dry ribs, pulled pork tasted like watered down sauce was added after cooking. 

Mac and cheese was creamy and good not over cooked 

Slaw was good- just normal slaw 

I honestly could not believe how dry my ribs were.... It was pretty heart breaking as I had been looking forward to going there just for that for sooooo long ! 

Brisket was cooked well ... For most of the pieces I got because again part of it was dry. 

Tip***The sauces are good but they need to leave the ribs in for a longer cooking time seriously tho .... Please do.... Ribs are suppose to fall of the bone not be like jerky .... If I wanted jerky I wouldn't order ribs. 

Customer service was great! Very friendly and helpful. 

This place has a LOT of potential to go so far ... The major loss of stars for me was because when you are a bbq house that advertises ribs like that I expect them to know it is suppose to fall off the bone.

My dog is really nervous(shaking, hiding, an occasional growl) at the vet.  Other places I have been the technicians make a comment about her being scared, ask questions, then leave. At countryside the technician went out of her way to try to calm my dog. My dog even gave her kisses, which she has NEVER done in the 10 years I have been taking her to the vet. I wish I could recall her name, because she was excellent. Dr. Hoppe was wonderful and knowledgeable and made our visit quick and easy without trying to add any tests or procedures that weren't needed. Because my dog is so nervous she is often overlooked as being a good girl, so I appreciate the nice words that Dr. Hoppe said about her! The free hugs and kisses on the bill is also a nice touch. Thanks for the good experience!

I was unfortunately very dissatisfied with my visit. After having been recommended by more than one person for their Thai food, the Pad Thai and Massaman dishes were bland and lacked many key ingredients. The Pad Thai was particularly sparse lacking leeks, raddish, and especially the bean sprouts....and it isn't Pad Thai without bean sprouts.

In short, isn't worth the wait or the hype.

DO not use this company !   The "owner" is rude, obnoxious, self absorbed and if the lack of business is any reflection of the work they do (NO cars,  no repairs, not busy ever) - then that should tell you ** ALL ** you need to know.  Whenever you walk into a company and there is NOTHING going on - then you should be suspicious.  This guy needs a course in Customer Service - but it wont matter - doubt he will be open long enough.   DO NOT USE - don't subject yourself - PLENTY of other quality, caring, busy automotive repair places right nearby.   PASS THIS ONE OVER .....

Best fried chicken I have ever had. We went for brunch and started with the fried green tomato BLT. It was so delicious and unique. Next I had the chicken and waffles and my husband had the plain fried chicken. We both agreed it was the best fried chicken ever. The cocktails were delicious and so were the mimosas. I wish we had saved room for desert! Service was excellent and I loved the ambience.

We came here for brunch on a Monday.  Pretty tasty food!  Great selection of both brunch food, and regular dinner-type food.  The price was much better than I expected it to be for a Vegas buffet (around $24), and it included a free mimosa/bloody mary/champagne.  The decor is amazing, complete with great hanging glass installations in line with the rest of the Cosmopolitan hotel theme.  

Definitely try out the desserts (especially the great selection of gelato, and the chocolate covered strawberries!) as well as the macaroni & cheese.

Came here for lunch after a long night of partying.  I'm a huge fan of French food, and had definitely been craving it ever since I arrived at PH and saw that the Paris was next door.  Mon Ami Gabi definitely satisfied my craving!  A friend and I split the steak classique (steak with butter), and the quiche Lorraine.  So good!!!  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, as requested.  The quiche Lorraine was delicious, but I was so full by the time I got around to eating it that I only had a few bites; what I did eat was perfectly balanced.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders as well.  I only wish that the restaurant served steak tartare... I would've been on that like white on rice!

Side note, the bread is served warm and crusty, the way it should be.  I wanted to eat the whole baguette myself, not to lie... but highly disappointing was the cold butter! 

Definitely worth coming here for a meal that is nice, but not too nice (I'm looking at you, 16-course tasting menu at JG), when you're in Vegas.

I want to like this place SO MUCH.  The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  

To be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would "incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue "fighting".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. 

If this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. 

In short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.

I heard raves about onion rings being so good. I was a bit disappointed when I tried their onion rings. It tastes ok...not terrible but no seasoning to it. I like the A.&W.'s onion rings the best. Crispy and firm at most A&W's. Peter's were simple and bland. Maybe a bit like back in the 50's?  The burger was ok; it looked to be put together as an after thought and squished. The good thing is the variety milkshake flavours. That was what I was into; but for me; the milkshakes didn't have enough of that dairy/ice cream flavour for me. It was good but not giving me a wow factor. It didn't taste like real ice cream shake to me. I won't rave about it but don't hate it there. It's not a place I would want to go as top thing to do when in the area. Food is decent though.

The food was good BUT the service was terrible. There was no spoon for my coffee; they ran out of spoons they said. The waitresses aren't too friendly either. They were busy with their cell; texting and I had to wait a while for my coffee to be refilled. I was pretty much ignored for most of the lunch. Won't go again due to poor services. Also my home fries were burnt/dry. Other than that..the egg Benedict was good.

We went there with our 9 and 11 year old. We didn't feel too welcome at all by the manager because we bought our 2 girls with us who behaved very well and it felt too "upper class" to even go there with kids even if they are older. Not a place to go with kids even though kids are allowed. 

The lasagne was good but a bit burnt on top which I didn't like. The Alfredo pasta was flavourless. Not too good. Was disappointed that they had no pizza for a month when we went there. 

The waitress was sweet. But the manager ignored us and went for the people who looked like they had more money to spend and talked to them about the variety of wines. 

There was a sign when I came in that said something like no hats allowed or take off your hats. That was fine with me but a bit taken aback by that sign which kind of set the negative tone in a sense. 

Don't think I would go again because it felt like setting a foot in a stranger's house and felt awkward there. Food was good though but hard to enjoy myself.

My daughter and I are both picky about the sushi; she loves this place hands down so we only go here when the craving for sushi hits. The food is just amazing and delicious. My daughter often orders two plates of california rolls; her fave. Rice is good and food is just right. Not over or under cooked at all. I love their good prices; not even overpriced at all. :) The waitress was very sweet and nice. Hubs asked for extra pickled ginger and got that.

We live out of town and really just needed some place to watch our dog while we had lunch since it was too hot to leave him in the car. We decided to get him groomed and had a great experience. The staff was friendly and did a great job. The price was cheap compared to other places. They called when our dog was ready to be picked up and we told them we would be another 30 minutes until we could get there. That wasn't a problem!

This is a nice off-leash dog park. There are plenty of spots to sit while your pup plays. There's not a ton of shade which was fine for our visit in late October but I imagine it's miserable in the summer. The park is separated by weight. There was a third area not being used due to maintenance. My reviews is only 4/5 stars because it's kind of a small park. It certainly does the job though!

Took our 2 dogs for grooming here. While the groomer was nice he did an awful job. He had burnt the side of one of my dogs necks. There was burn scabs
For weeks afterwards. I let the groomer know, he apologized and said ill use a different Gaurd next time. We gave him another chance and this time the burn marks were even worse! He had two huge scabs on both sides of his neck. My dog was shaking the entire way home. I am not one to write reviews but had to in hopes that it might safe another dog having to go through this. I can't imagine how I'm gonna take him to another groomer, he's been traumatized.

I have been successfully treated by Dr. Xiao for 2 very different conditions.

1) I suffered a CTD / RSI hand/wrist injury due to my profession.  Rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests.  For a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.  Unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.  Dr. Xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how I sustained it.  She used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to remove the inflammation.  

Now, I am working with both Dr. Xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function.  I have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery.

2) I had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.  Dr. Xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel.  She used a combination of herbal remedies and acupuncture and cleared it away permanently after 4 months of treatments.

She is easily one of the best diagnosticians and practitioners that I have ever met, and she truly loves her work.  I cannot say enough about how she has dramatically improved my life.

I had a vacant rental house with pet odor that a competitor carpet cleaner washed twice to eliminate the odor throughout all of the carpets.  Desperate not to have to do new carpeting, I found Spotless Carpet Care on the internet and called Steve.  He came over right away and knew exactly how to search for the problem spots using a black light (the prior cleaning company was not trained with this technique).  He found nothing on the surface, as the carpet had been previously washed but gave me a great deal to wash it on his own, as he had high confidence it would work.

When he came to clean, he was on time and very professional.  The cleaning was very thorough and brightened quite a bit, even after the previous cleanings.  I would definitely recommend him for pet owners or landlords that have to clean carpets after someone with pets leaves the property.

I called Just-In Time on Monday to see if they could move a very large china buffet to Goodwill.  They were very professional and courteous and mentioned I could save some money with the Yelp Deal in place.

Robert and Rick, the crew, were very professional, on-time, and very efficient.  I was so impressed I wouldn't hesitate to use them again!

Thanks guys!

We woke up this morning and found out that our garage would not open and we could not lift it due to a broken spring.  Wayne came out 2 hrs later and saved the day!  He was professional, courteous, and honest.  The repair will help our original garage door last another 10 years or so.

Thanks Wayne!

I recently had an interior paint job of bedrooms, bathrooms, trim, and touch up done through a competitor.  The price seemed to float higher and higher, even though I thought we had reached an agreement on the work to be done.  Needless to say, it left a bad taste in my mouth and some of the touch up looked terrible.  

I called David and he was incredibly helpful and sympathetic to my situation.  I bought a couple of gallons of paint and he made the most of the situation on a limited budget.  The house now looks fabulous and I will not hesitate to use him again! 

Thanks David!

Dr. Andy, Dr. Patty, Dr. Jeff, and the entire team has dramatically improved my spinal alignment on a permanent basis.  Yes, I said permanent!  It's not just them, its their combination of great talent, compassion, and a top notch methodology (chiropractic biophysics).  I used to get migraine headaches 1-2x per month...other talented chiropractors would be able to alleviate the symptoms after onset, but then it would come back again in a few weeks.  Since treating at Pivonka Chiropractic,  I have had 2 in a year, and the severity has been much less than before.  I used to have swallowing problems...this has also all but disappeared.  My shoulders could not relax.  Now they do.  I was so impressed, I sent my entire family.  

FYI: This form of chiropractic is not for those looking for a quick-fix!  It requires serious commitment, but I promise that the gain in your quality of life will be well worth it!

Never had better burgers before! My wife and I were looking for a place to have some dinner in Toronto's Fashion District. Going to Big Smoke Burger was the best decision we could ever make. I had the Big Smoke Burger which was simply awesome side by side with some very big and good tasting fried onion rings. My wife had the Chicken Burger with french fries. It was so delicious and the sauce was so tasty. We will definitely come back next time we are in Toronto.

Not impressed.  I took my Cavalier King Charles in today and gave them specific instructions about shaving his belly and legs and giving him a trim on top.  Not only did they not trim his belly but it looks like they just washed him, put a scarf on his neck, and called it a day.  We will be seeking a different groomer in the future.  It's slightly cheaper than other groomers, but who cares if your dog doesn't look right?  

Also, the shop seems a little haphazard in how it's run, dogs running around everywhere in a small space.

My friends and I went into Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian for a late dinner and drinks.  The food was OK, our server was reasonably pleasant, but the night manager Matt Timms, when questioned about the cost of an item on our bill, was so off the charts rude- my friends and I will never come back!  Mr. Timms even went so far as to threaten to call my girlfriend's employer to make her look bad when he learned we were locals.  I've never seen someone lose their cool like that, especially not a manager.  There are many better options for restaurants within this casino.  Beware!

Never again.  I've been to numerous chiropractors and I've never walked out in this kind of excruciating pain (I left in a neck brace!)  I communicated several times that it was hurting and he kept pushing.  There are better, more experienced chiropractors out there.  Don't make the same mistake I did.

The worst stay I have ever had. I understand it is a cheap motel. With that being said; we ark for 1 room with one bed simple two night. We arrived and found they gave away that room. So they gave us an "upgrade"we walk into a dirty room where the beds weren't made and towels left on the floor of the bathroom. So of corse we walk back to the front desk ask for a clean room. They gave us one just down the hall. As we lay on our bed we hear burn outs in the parking lot and now the building smells like burnt rubber. Mixed with the smoke and musty smell. I complained to the front desk and I was told I think the "regulars" are working on a car. At midnight mind you.  I look out side my window and they are tack welding and grinding out side. I will never stay here in my life and warn others.

My friend and I went here for lunch today. We got seated right away.. Took about 10 minutes for us to be greeted by our waiter. I ordered the curry beef stew and a honey dew slush. The curry had a good taste, but it had literally 2 pieces of meat and the rest was potatoes. We were done eating and we were waiting for the check... About 15-20 minutes.

I gotta give the place 2 stars because the staff is extremely nice. If that weren't the case I'd give this place 1 star because of their lack of knowledge. 

I have a 2008 6.4L diesel and it calls for 15W-40 in hot AZ weather. Newer ford diesels call for 10W-30. I should've checked to see they put in the right oil but when my wrench light came on and read a p012f DTC I knew immediately they put too light of oil in.

I got an oil change here a few months ago. When the car was ready they informed me that my AC was out, which I already knew. They told me my compressor was shot and quoted me $1000 to replace it. I left bummed out. I finally got around to getting my AC fixed this week. I took the car to my usual shop, Granite Reef Auto to check it out. They told me there was no belt around the compressor. Well, $100 later I have AC! How did Advanced Auto come to the conclusion that my compressor was bad? I can never trust them after that. I will never go there again. Granite Reef Auto is great! They saved me $900. Advanced Auto was ready to take my $1000 and replace my already working compresdor. Shame on them. Really bad business!

The place is kind of filthy. I tried it 4 or 5 times. The last time the barber didn't even finish the haircut and yanked the cover so that the hairs that she cut fell all over my clothes. The old guy was okay the first couple of times I went there, but there's no guarantee who you get and in any case you come out feeling like you need a shower urgently.

Let me start off by saying this WAS my favorite Mexican spot in las Vegas. I drive from Southern Highlands just for the Pastor tacos! Usually I go late night but today I went in around 5 ish. Was greeted by the kitchen employees and when they asked what I wanted I nicely replied with "I need a few minutes". This man I never seen working there before said in Spanish a rude remark back to his coworkers about me saying I'm not ready yet. I was so offend, and he totally ruined my appetite so I left without ordering anything. Horrible experience for a loyal customer.

This place was awesome! I found out I had plantar fasciitis, which stinks since I have a 16 mile run to train for in November. Linda told me to come in and she'll take care of me. I was properly measured, asked a bunch of great questions and totally catered to. It was great. I got an awesome pair of new Nike running shoes that not only look really cool, but fit my feet perfectly. I also got an awesome set of running socks, inserts and a roller. They explained to me that I have tight calves, which can affect my feet the way it did. So, I got the roller to help break up the knots. I feel great and loved the experience. I'm not sure I'll ever just go to a Sports Authority again for sneakers. This was great!

The ONLY reason they didn't get a 5th star, was because I asked the hostess a few days beforehand if there was dancing, and she said "yes, the band is awesome and they move the tables out so people can dance."  The band WAS definitely amazing, but everyone kind of just stood there and my wife wanted to dance on her bday.  Other than that.... awesome!

Wow... talk about the absolute WORST company I've ever tried to do business with.  It does NOT get much worse than these guys.  First... a little background, I have never gone out of my way to complain about a company.  If you see my other reviews, you'll notice I go out of my way to rave about companies on here.  There's only 1 other negative review in my portfolio, and even that company is 4 stars compared to crappy old Appliance Certified.  

I used these guys about a year ago, and the guy that came over was cool and the price was reasonable.  So I actually referred them to about 3 people since and kept their magnet on my fridge. 

However, last week my sink started leaking and we were unable to use it anymore until fixed.  I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message. 

Bottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.  One for every time they messed up.

Been going here for 3 years.  Great gym.  Other than a pool they have everything u need!  Because of the no pool, I was going to give them a 4 star.  However, because they give yelpers an awesome deal by awarding them with a free smoothie and tan if they check in... It will be a 5 star!

PS:  Expect slower service, because it is TRULY mom and pop.  If you go in with this attitude, you'll really enjoy the experience.  If you want quick, timely servers that ask you how food is every 30 seconds, you may want to try Olive Garden or something.

Christina's the best, use her and you'll have no regrets!  You can simply explain what you want to her and she'll figure out how do cut and style so that it complements your features!

And the price is beyone reasonable for a great hair cut!

I had my big olde english sheepdog groomed here and they did a fine job and the price was on par with everyone else. Actually I think the price is about $10 more, but I'll pay the extra money because of the extra service this place provides.

I really appreciate that they have a pet taxi, bc of this service my dog gets a ride home for free (but we did tip the driver). Since I have a little child it's hard for me to bring my dog and pick him up on the days I would have time to pick him up, so the taxi is worth it for me. Bc of this service I can now drop off my dog before I go to work and my husband (on days he's caring for my daughter) can be home to let my dog inside. This is easier for me than having to bring my 100+ dog inside while holding my baby.

Shauna's is right next to Mountainside Fitness, it's right in Surprise so if you live in Surprise this place will be easy to get to. 

I also thought the service was great too. I'll definitely be taking my dog back here the next time he needs to get groomed.

I joined this gym after leaving Fitness 1. This gym isn't perfect but is as close to perfect as I could ask for. 

I like the long hours the gym provides for daycare. And daycare will change dirty diapers!!! And for the most part I really do like the gym daycare employees (except I had an experience where the daycare manager was extremely rude, but I forgave that one instance because I figured she was having a bad day).

I also enjoy the towel service. & The equipment is great. The classes seem great though I have yet to attend a class. 

But I wish the gym would add free wifi for members to use while working out (so that I can watch netflix while working out), add some more channels to the equipment's tvs (I wish they would add e, bravo, mtv) and add a laundry shoot for towels inside the locker rooms. I even put in a request for the laundry shoot but Mountainside obviously just ignored my request. 

I also wish this location & all other locations would have a water service that they provide in their Scottsdale location. It seems like the west valley is constantly getting the short end of the stick and this is another example of that isn't it? & might be wrong but I think the Scottsdale location also has better tv channels than the Surprise gym does.

But despite those gripes I'm still a fan. This is the best gym in Surprise.

I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could. Because to me, this place isn't blow your socks off delicious! Instead it's just good enough. 

Look, when I'm craving pho I'm glad I have a place close by to order from, however it's just not as good as I'm used to back home. I think my problem is it doesn't taste as authentic as I'm used to. This place to me seems like it's trying to be asian fusion (like Pei Wei or PF Changs) when I just want pho nothing fancy just pho.

Though I did think the spring rolls were awesome!!!

But nonetheless it does fulfil my cravings without me having to drive 45 minutes, so I'm happy about that!

I love it here!

But you really need to order the all you can eat because the portions on the plate of meat are too little for the amount you're paying.  The all you can eat is around $25 / person & everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it. If you order the all you can eat then you don't have to pay extra for rice (which you really shouldn't have to do if you put in an order for meat--but that's just my opinion).

Seoul Grill recently revised their menu, so there are more options for different meats. They have added different flavors, which are so yummy! Try to spicy pork belly (sam gyop sal) that was recently added it's one of my favorites.

And remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat.   

I must say it's really nice not having to drive to Koreatown for a decent korean bbq place!

Oh and all the people who work here are so nice & helpful! I wish they would make a Seoul Grill in Surprise! We need a korean restaurant in Surprise!

I'm so glad I found this salon!!! After getting my hair burned last year & then finding out that Hair City in Phoenix closed I wasn't sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened. I even debated driving out to LA to get my hair done in Koreatown.

But luckily I received a referral to Cleo's from a Korean restaurant and so I went here and am glad I did!

I got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo.

I have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.)

I also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year)

Go here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea & Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, & English. 

I believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid. And digital perm costs around $130

I also had the best massage by Kimber. I'm always having neck / upper back pain because of stress & taking care of a young baby but Kimber gave my upper back so much attention that I finally found relief in my back. 

And everyone from was so nice! One stop shop for hair, body, & nail care!

Helen's was terrible.  I got magic straight at Helens I think I paid $150 ish and she did not know what she was doing.  & kept blaming me, and kind of made me feel stupid my korean was not on par with hers.  

Then when I called to tell her it didn't come out she had me come in again.  Attempted it again but given she doesn't know what she's doing obviously it didn't come out.  

She also laughed when I asked her to cut my white husband's hair.  Told me to go to a white salon.  I thought she was really rude.  Hair city is waaaaay better.  623) 847-0308

Hair city has on multiple occasions successfully straightened my hair (hair city did give me a funky hair cut once)

Family owned , Mike and Kelly (owners) are both very nice and both know their stuff. It's nice going to a repair shop that I trust isn't taking advantage of me! And it's nice walking in and speaking to the owners. Great customer service! 

Every time I go to one of those other repair shops they come up with a list of stuff to fix -- and when I check in with my father in law or friends they tell me those repairs are not necessary for my vehicles!

I've been a member here for 4 or 5 years.  I only pay $9 / month and the gym had everything I need... that is until I had a baby.  Look you know what you're getting at this gym.  It's kind of a no frills but cheap gym that's clean enough. So it worked for me during these past years.

the daycare hours that the gym are ok but the daycare workers don't change a baby's dirty diapers and instead page the parent which is disruptive to a workout.  Also the daycare hours (for me) don't start early enough.  So I'm sad to say I'm going to be switching to another gym probably at the new year.  

But I did enjoy working out at Fitness during the past 4/5 years.  And all the gym workers are so nice and quick to help out with any billing issues (of which I have had too many!).  So I am sad to be switching.  But need to so that I can work out around my & my baby's schedules.

Went here to celebrate my anniversary. Food was good. But not lick the bowl clean good. 

For the amount of money we spent I think we could have done better. But the meal was fine. Service was great. 

Dessert is to die for. Pound cake & chooclate fondue. Enough said! 

I agree with other posters who suggest just going for dessert. The food isn't worth the price.

This used to be my favorite nail salon in Surprise.  But I think they changed ownership (in fact I saw that they changed ownership-- at least that's what they're advertising in the Surprise weekly).  

Anyway, I received a white tip pedi from a new tech (female).  She did not paint even  lines.  And when I looked at my toes the lines were a mess and did not match one another.  Some were lower, some were shorter.  It's hard to explain but  my toes did not resemble one another.  I asked if she could fix the lines.  And she had to redo the lines and still couldn't get it right.

Look, getting a pedicure is a service and I want it to look nice.  And the fact I'm paying extra for the white tip... I feel like they should get it right.

I've been getting pedicures for years and have never complained.  

Anyway, it was obvious I wasn't happy, the manager(?) Kevin came and looked at my pedi and told me it looked fine to him.  They know me at this salon.  I think even if they thought I was imagining the concerns (which I was not) I think they should have had another tech redraw the lines or comp something to make me feel valued.  Instead they made me feel worthless as a customer by telling me there was nothing wrong.

So I got upset, passed on the manicure, paid for the pedicure and left.

I've been going to this nail salon for years, I think 2 years.  They know me at this salon.  And to question me when I'm upset about something just doesn't make me happy.  

I'm not going back to this salon.

We have been going to Phoenix for sometime now, but only recently learned of Joes Farm Grill. We tried it out, and let me tell you, it was awesome. Their portions were just right, and even though I was full when we left, I didn't feel gross like I do at other restaurants. I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I loved it. Thin, flatbread crust made for a light pizza, very tasty pizza. My wife had the chicken Caesar salad. She gets that salad so often that she knows her Caesars, and she said this was her favorite dressing. And the chicken of course was amazing as well.

I've been to see Dr. Tom Nguyen for the past few years.  He explains things clearly, he's friendly and is willing to take the time to answer questions.  He does the cleaning himself, which means that you get more time with your dentist.  The cleanings have always been free of any significant pain (as little discomfort as a trip to the dentist can be, anyway!).  He has never suggested any costly/unnecessary procedures (which I'd recently heard can happen), and I'm glad that he noticed some gum recession and suggested that I see a periodontist to prevent problems in the future.  Appointments have always been easy to get.  All in all, a great dentist!

I am giving 4 stars for the coffee, otherwise it would only be three. My croissant tasted dry and as if it was made a few days ago. However, I could tell it was yummy. I find it very difficult to find a good cup of coffee out of my house and neighborhood, since we are spoiled in the Bay Area. Sure enough, they actually use a Bay Area roaster (Equator) and it was great and quite the relief!

I am in love with this place. Today was my first time and we need one in Tucson immediately! 

The parking lot was packed and just as I was about to get irritated I noticed there is complimentary valet service. Que  fancy! 

The inside is super casual and clean and the staff was awesome! We didn't get to sit outside in the crazy cool and dog friendly patio. I saw a dog sitting on the a table outside! 

I ordered from the $10 brunch menu. Food plus 10oz beer or mimosa. I had the breakfast wrap, the wife had the breakfast flat bread. I recommend both. My girls had chicken tenders which were actual chicken with a tasty fried covering. They loved their food too. 

If you have kids, a dog, and hankering for good food you owe it to yourself to come here.

A must stop on your way back from Vegas! 

I had the huevos rancheros with their signature green chili and pork. So good! The portion to price ratio was a nice return to normal coming from the land of a $10 beer on the strip 30 minutes away. The eggs were cooked just right and the pork green chili was smothered over the fried tortillas and beans. If you like green chili and solid breakfast food you have to take the very quick detour into the historic downtown area. 

I'm sure there is a wait almost every weekend but that will give you some time to do some antiquing. 

I'll definitely be going back!

This theatre is the ultimate splurge!  From the comfy recliners complete with blanket and pillow (in the premium seating) to the fantastic wait staff you couldn't ask for a more luxurious way to watch a movie.  Being able to book online and have reserved seats is very convenient.  Yeah, it's expensive (total of $250 for premium seating and dinner for 5-no alcohol involved) but is worth it for a nice evening out with friends once in awhile!

Bought a used beetle at a dealer out of state and had a small problem with it on the way home.  Called San Tan VW service department the next day and was pleasantly surprised how friendly the people were on the phone.  I took the vehicle there the same day and was greeted by Jeff Aguilar in service who looked at the car and called me within the hour with the diagnosis.  The next day, the car was ready, fixed right and freshly washed. They even worked with the dealer in California that I bought the car from for payment.  I will be bringing the car back for regular maintenance without hesitation.  Thanks and keep up the good work!

Went tonight for a quick dinner which turned out to be over an hour.  Nice decor, very clean but the very slow service (40min wait for our entrees) was way too long.  Never saw the waitress again after we placed the order until it was time for the check.  When the food arrived, it was only lukewarm and despite my attempt to flag down a waiter to refill our drinks, we were basically ignored.  Can't see this place lasting any longer than the other places that have been it this location, will not return.

Kudos to Charlotte Motor Speedway!! They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!! Way to go CMS even though we regularly attend races here you now have a customer for life!

I have eaten here quite a few times and the food is good. The 2 stars is because they no longer have limes!(trying to get a response) I ordered a margarita (ultimate which was very good) and when I asked for a lime the bartender said they had stopped ordering them because they were too expensive! Now granted this didn't make or break my meal but that was one of the strangest things I have heard. It wasn't like it was $2 margarita night ($9 to be exact) Hopefully someone in management will see this and respond. If you like a lime with your margarita or your Mexican beer you may want to pass until they they make a better business decision

Terrible customer service.  Was looking to buy an Evoque.  The salesman was totally arrogant  and the Sales Manager wouldn't budge on the quoted price even though I could get the same car in Scottsdale Az for 2K less.  I just wanted an extra 500 off - nothing crazy.  I was basically told that they know they are the only game in town - only Land Rover dealer for hundreds of miles and I was just going to have to take it or leave it.  After getting totally pissed and deciding that I'll just buy the car and get screwed on a bad deal they tell me that it is getting late (Saturday 4PM) and that even if I buy the car - right now - they can't delivery it to me today because they don't have enough time.  I'll have to wait till next week to get the car I am standing right in front of.  What!!!  What kind of low budget garbage is that?  

I've never tried so hard to give someone 54K.  I'm done with these guys.  Taking my business and money somewhere else. What a joke.

I went to see Dr. Steven Folkerth for a routine physical. The receptionist was unfriendly. The doctor gave me a prescription for blood tests and Vit D test.

I went to do the tests the same day. After waiting for about 2 weeks and I did not hear from Dr. Steven Folkerth about the result of my tests. I called his office and the receptionist said she has the result in. I went in to pick up a copy of the tests and the receptionist was still unfriendly. I saw that my triglycerides was above normal range and that the Vit D test was missing from the report. I asked the receptionist to locate my Vit D report and she said she is going to give me a call next day. I waited and she never call. I called her and she said she is going to get back to me. It has been 10 days since I talked to her and she never called me back. I am missing a vital part of the test because my Vit D level was low from a previous test. I understand Vit D is very important for my daily health. I got a run around. The doctor or the receptionist never contact me about my high triglycerides and missing test.

I am very disappointed from the people in this office.

This by far THE best sushi in the valley. No joke, everything is to die for! The sushi chefs are amazing. I like to sit at the bar here even though I usually opt for a table elsewhere. Their menu of specialty rolls is a bit intimidating I admit but, just let them know what you like and they'll make excellent recommendations. I must say, the sauces are beyond anything I've ever tasted. If it were socially acceptable, I would pick up the plate and lick it clean. I'm not exaggerating, they're heavenly perfection and unlike no other.
Please be aware there are no prices on the menu. Apparently it changes based on market fish prices and it can be a bit pricey. If I lived closer I'd be there all the time, seriously. No matter where you live, it's absolutely worth it!

The blackened chicken quesadilla is sooo good, they give you tons of sour cream and delicious guacamole to enjoy it with. The chips/salsa/guacamole side is a must order. They're portions are fantastic, their food is consistently delicious, and they have my favorite frothy pina colada drink. I really couldn't ask for more, I love you Habaneros ;)

Excellent food, fresh quality ingredients, great service. I feel great after eating here, not at all sluggish. The spring rolls are amazing, we usually get a few orders. The jasmine iced tea is fantastic. The owners are sweet and passionate about their business, they even have a cookbook out and available for purchase there.

Pat is truly an artist! I love what she does to my hair, not to mention the way I feel after she works her magic. Her cuts are perfection, her highlights stunningly gorgeous. Whatever it is you want she can give it to you. Pat is experienced, talented, and knows how to make you look good. I even referred a guy friend to her who was frustrated after receiving mediocre cuts all around town. Needless to say, his hair looks great and with minimal effort which he loves. Also, this is my favorite Ulta, everyone is friendly and helpful.

I love 5 & Diner! The cherry cokes, the mac 'n' cheese, Mrs. Cleaver's pot roast (no longer on the menu but you can still order it), the diner grilled chicken sandwich, and the most delicious root beer floats & shakes! Being a classic movie fan, of course I love the atmosphere and photos of movie stars that adorn the walls. Plus, some nights they have live rockabilly music and people bring their cool, classic cars. How awesome is that? There's no where else like this in Scottsdale. Oh yes and the service is excellent too!

Worst food and service ever. My boyfriend took one bite of their so called steak sandwich and said dog food. My boyfriend is nicer than I am. Seriously, I doubt my cat would've eaten it. What really got me however was the fact that when we politely informed the staff we were questioned 3 times about why it wasn't good. Now, I could have been straight up honest and flat out rude about it but it not our style. The man who questioned us could have been a manager but since he never identified himself he could have been anyone. I suggest the zipps staff eat it themselves and find out exactly why it's worthy of sending back. Don't bother when in the same complex there are truly excellent places to spend your money.

I'm mostly reiterating what other have said but with a few additions.

General
- Bad ventilation. With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.
- Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing
= Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.

Bouldering area
+ Decent number of routes and variety
- Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhere

Top rope area
-The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird.
- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?
- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.
- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.

We weren't planning on visiting here but saw a billboard (they work!) saying Jerry Seinfeld was on that night and we just couldn't miss out that opportunity!

So we ended up with seats towards the back but the view was still great along with the acoustics. Would make for a great venue to see some live acts in as well.

To be honest at first I didn't want to stay here as it seemed like it might be a bit 'tacky' but after being recommended by a few good friends we decided to book in as part of our US trip for 3 nights.

How wrong I was! Upon entering the driveway it was just 'wow' all of the way. The reception was massive and they had plenty of staff ready to book you in. The only one downside was that we had to go into a smoking room which did have some smell left to it but was gone in a matter of hours and reception did tell us we could change later that afternoon if it was still bad.

The room was very spacious and the bathroom was huge. The resort is massive and trust me it will take you some time to explore. The gym had a great setup and has plenty of equipment- no waiting like at the gym back home!

We gave the buffet a go and just like everyone said it's a must visit. They make just about anything there and have heaps of options to choose from.

All up well worth the stay and couldn't believe the price compared to other hotels in the USA.

ps. the blinds in the room operate by a switch - we spent a while trying to force them open haha!

Oh. My. God. This place was awesome! Not only did it have the widest choice of options I have ever seen at a buffet, the quality and presentation was like a top restaurant!

Highly recommend going here if you're after a good feed. Plenty of healthy choices as well but I must admit I gave in to quite a few of those tasty pastries... :)

Outside seating that's truly different!

As we were only in Vegas for a few nights we wanted to make sure we got to experience as much as possible - including the dining. After doing the usual hunt on Yelp we decided to try out Spago and it was a great suggestion.

When we arrived the waiter asked if we wanted sit inside or out and we opted to go outside - best choice! To be honest I thought the blue ceiling was tacky at first but after a while it really started to trick you that you were outside!

The food was awesome (as expected) but the service from the waiters was top notch as well. Highly recommend.

Never being to a Cirque du Soleil before I didn't know fully what to expect but judging by what everyone else had told me, it would be an amazing show.

Happy to say it was superb and I'll be certain to see another if I get the chance! It was amazing to see the skills of the performers and it was a great mix of acrobatics, theatre and comedy.

Looking forward to the next one!

We always love our Italian food so I couldn't resist checking out this place when we were inside Wynn checking out the casino.

It was a great find and the decor inside was executed perfectly! The staff we really quick to serve us and the meals came out really quick. We had asked for a white sauce instead of the tomato for one of our meals which they got wrong but were very apologetic and came out just as quick with another one for us.

All up a great meal and find in such a great casino.

Worth it just for the view.

We only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)

The drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there. But the main thing we went for (the view) was well worth it - especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below.

We had been recommended Pink Jeep from some friends of ours and we're really thankful they did!

The trip was well organised with them picking us up from the hotel and then heading out to the Canyon. Our driver gave us some great commentary on the way out and had the perfect balance of not talking the whole time but still being really informative.

We stopped at a few spots on the way out including Hoover Dam and a small store for a rest stop which made the trip out there feel even more authentic going into an actual country store.

We didn't realise when we got there that we would all be going onto buses afterwards but the guide was really good at making sure we all had the freedom of looking around each lookout and then still grouping back together at the end.

Thanks for making it an easy and great trip!

This place is a must visit for anyone to Las Vegas!

I'm so thankful I came across it on here as it was never suggested to us by anyone else or even at the hotel we were staying. You start off the tour at their meeting spot where they give you plenty of water and warnings about just how hot it can get in there so be careful!

We got to meet our tour guide as well who gave us a quick background on the non-profit organisation behind the museum - it's great to see such a dedicated group of people preserving what some people would just treat as junk.

It's an amazing collection of old signage and as part of the tour around the 'boneyard' the guide gave us some great (and humorous) history about Las Vegas.
 This really made the tour as there was so much we learnt at the same time and it was astonishing to learn just how much the city has changed.

If you like your photography this place is an absolute must visit. There's so many good opportunities as the place is full of so much colour and typography.

Stop reading my review and book in now! :)

Roast beef was amazing that sandwich alone will bring me back again before I leave Vegas.  I didn't care for the pizza I've had better.  But that sandwich was easily one of the best I've had.  I ordered a pizza, chips and drink and the roast beef sandwich for about $20.

The veggie sandwich is around $8 is also great. And the BLT is good as well.

It's ok if it fits your budget. Plus when you get out your on freemont.  But if you are not a silly person or don't have enough drinks in you it will be hard to get into. Buy your tickets at tix4tonight on the strip it comes out to $104 for two. Don't get the pasta most didn't finish there's.  Chicken was o.k.   sodas are free and well drinks are $6.

for the PRICE the rooms are huge and very comfortable. the AC. was strong, for 110 degree heat, the beds were comfy and they have a hid abed. large bathrooms separate tub and shower. this place is a hotel first and casino second. All the rooms are in different buildings from the casino which makes it very family friendly.
        front desk was very friendly and helpful. Even though its not on the strip its a block and half away from the center of the strip. a short cab ride or a short walk and you can be at ceasers palace, bellagio, paris,and bally's for the shuttle to the Rio. wi-fi is free in the lobby and pool side. there is a fee to have it in your room. there is a resort fee if you book it through a third party like orbitz, travelocity, priceline,etc. you should check there price first and see if you can save some money. i was there from Thursday to Monday on labor day weekend. it was quite and peace full as appose to the chaos of the strip on a holiday weekend.

I'm talkin about the regular buffet on Wednesday under $55 for two.  without a players club. we got to the line around 7 and were seated about 7:15. it wasn't to busy.
at the dessert bar you can order fresh coffee or a latte with Kahlua. If somebody hadn't told us we wouldn't have known. 
      everything was really good. The place is very clean.  Don't bother looking for the bathroom its not in the Buffet its outside to the right.

mystery adventure is must do Sunday Thru Thursday. its great but its 3hrs+ long. i like the fact that it had something for everybody. you don't have to be a mystery junkie to enjoy the adventure. and for the price you really cant beat it. nothing in Vegas will keep you entertain for so long for so little, plus there's snacks to munch on while you try to look for clues. The one thing that is definitely fun is to determine what clues you need to solve the mystery and what clues you don't.   you'll get to meet people and work as a team to solve the mystery.  if your on a tight budget this is a must.

besides going up the Eiffel tower and the crepes its the only reason i even step inside the Paris casino.  I've been here several times already and it hasn't gotten old.  no cover, two drink minimum and  pricey to, if you haven't you must.  two guys on a piano going at it.  they play everything from oldies to today's music.

i was there from June 24 to 27th. the room big enough for four adults. we checked in early and we got a room on the 25th floor facing the strip. that was the best part. the view was unbelievable. the AC. was strong. the room was very modern and clean. the beds were very comfortable. the casino i didn't care to much about nothing special to see or write about. there is a free show outside the hotel. if you haven't seen it. its worth check out. the area is pretty good, there is tram to the mirage and next to that is ceasers palace and on the other side is a big mall. accross the street is the Venetian, Harras casino (and a shuttle to Rio that were the best buffet in vagas)and the carnival bar. pool parties are not the worst but not the best either. the DJ was pretty good ,the down side very little shade. 

there is a mandatory $22 a day resort fee that includes wi-fi in every room and newspaper in the lobby. they don't tell you about the fee until you check in.

great tip i found by accident. book your room through www.easyclicktravel.com and you wont pay a resort fee of $20 per night.  I'm not sure if it works for other hotels as well.  the hotel is great location, great bathtub, comfy bed, good or great view of the strip depending on your room.  only downside is walls are thin. you can hear the next room so gotta keep the TV. turned up.

it doesn't get better than green valley ranch sports-book.  1 dollar beer, 1 dollar hot dogs, turf grill only top of the line food and priced very good, plus free well drinks when you gamble (must get coupon when you place wager).  get there early and you get your own TV. booth., the waitresses are very thorough, they walk down every isle and ask everybody if the want a drink. unlike ceasers.  the whole right side is for football and the left is for horse racing,  but you can pretty much sit anywhere.

This place is a coffee shop by day, and a bar by night, which may help explain the stripper pole and the dance floor. 

Really nice atmosphere, lounge-like seating areas and free wifi. What's not to like?  Well. While I did appreciate not being charged for soy milk, and I liked that they charged extra for to go/paper cups (I think it was 50 cents) the soy latte I had was totally awful. 

Bitter, sour and composed of mostly foam. Maybe this was an off day, but it was honestly atrocious. I wouldn't mind visiting Blondie's in the evening sometime, but I think I'll just skip the coffee from now on.

Relaxing atmosphere, educational chalk based corn diagrams, and air conditioning... what more could you ask for? Well, add to all of that, that the food is delicious. Maizal is a recent addition to the Liberty Village area. They have vegan and gluten-free options in addition to non-vegan/veg ones.

The menu is short and simple. At the moment, the vegan options are: grilled quesadillas sin queso (ask for no cheese/dairy) with either poblano peppers or mushrooms, the sopes with black beans, tlacoyos (bean filled tortillas), and opales (cactus.) All very yummy sounding options. Their tortillas are entirely corn based (and gluten-free) and made fresh every morning. (they also happen to be delicious.)

Other things on the menu I should mention: the horchata. Traditionally milk-less, it's rice based at Maizal, with a cinnamon spice, and perfectly ice cold. 

Outdoor patio space is out front on Jefferson, and small but decent. Interior space is ample, but I imagine it's going to be an area lunch time takeout place pleaser, a tasty, healthy meal for under ten dollars. If you sit in like we did, you can read about the history and cultivation of corn on the very aesthetically pleasing chalkboards (and no joke, it really is interesting.) And let me say it again: Air Conditioning.

We each ordered 2 grilled quesadillas sin-queso (no cheese.) We sat sipping on horchata's while we waited and enjoyed the corn diagrams. They arrived, with pico de gallo on shredded lettuce, and a side of refried beans.  One poblano pepper and one mushroom. One bite and I've decided these tortillas are made of tasty magic. That one bite was all tortilla, and it was so rich in maizey-flavour and texturally superior to nearly all other tortillas I've had up until now (so I eat a lot of tacos...)

The fillings for both were great, both hearty and satisfying with rich savory flavours. Add some of the pico and a touch of lettuce and it is perfection. The folks at Maizal are doing exciting things with food, and I'm looking forward to seeing more, and eating much more from them.

p.s. prices are reasonable.

This is another place I'd never have stumbled upon had it not been for the Indie Coffee Passport. I'm never in the George Brown area. We dropped in on a Saturday morning and it was mostly empty.  Walking by, it looks like an old antique furniture store with a random assortment of unmatched pieces.

No, but really, I like random, and I like the atmosphere, it's weird but well lit. I'll call it... cozy. I liked the big wooden table by the window I didn't have any luck connecting to their wifi with my ipod but I saw other people on laptops tapping away. Minimal plug ins, but they exist.

It was a beautiful looking cup of coffee, but it may have also been the worst almond latte I've ever drank. I think it's great that they offer almond milk, but I'm not convinced they knew how to use it that day. Overall... my problem was that the coffee was very bitter. Way too bitter. 

Although it didn't effect me, this place is cash only. No Debit Cards Allowed!

I went to Z-Teca for the first time a few weeks ago after being really excited to try it out. Unfortunately, as with most over hyped oversold places, once I did try it, I was really disappointed.

Service was friendly but the flavour was lacking. It felt like I had gone to Chipotle, but so much worse. The rice and vegetables were boring, and rice was in copious amounts. Beans are optional/extra? What is up with that? It's a burrito!

I doused my burrito in hot sauce to give it some flavour, and vowed to find some where else to go next time I was hungry in Fairview Mall.

So it's the first day Tori's Bakeshop is open, so maybe it's premature to review them... but I can't help it. Yelp must know about a new vegan & gluten free friendly bakery.

It took me about 40 minutes on the Queen streetcar  to get here after work... but it was worth it. Since it was the end of the day, they had already run out of many of their sweet baked treats (even after apparently baking 3 day's worth of things) but I grabbed a vanilla cupcake with butter cream frosting, a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and a gluten free butter tart (and a non gluten free butter tart). They were all delicious. The cupcake was spongy and fluffy, the icing sweet, whipped, and not stiff at all. I was especially partial to the GF butter tart.

Friendly service, and great interior design. I loved the overhead lights - they're freaking lamps made from giant beaters, plus every table had fresh flowers on it. One word sums this place up -  adorable. (In two words - adorably delicious.) I love the random jars with stuff in it aesthetic. Lots of greens and neutral tones.

Also - wifi.Free functional wifi. There are outlets all over the place if you look for them (one main one that I know of is right at the front corner with the comfy seating. Yes.

Golly I wish this was closer to parkdale/trinity-bellwoods - though odds are, I'll be back really really soon.

I'm not quite sure what the fuss is about about Chipotle. My burrito was flavourless and unexciting. When I bit into it I couldn't help but think... wow, I waited 15 minutes in line for THIS? 

I think it didn't help that one of the members of counter staff left right as I got to her station, so I stood there an extra 5 or 6 minutes waiting for someone further down the chain to realize... oh nothing is happening.

The one of the things I did like was the tortilla chips with the hint of lime and the fresh pico.

Maybe I had a bad experience, maybe I've just had really amazing Mexican food, maybe I should try them again, or maybe I should just try a different location.

I'm late to the Hot Beans praising party, but not late in trying out their delicious tacos and donuts. Taking a bite out of one of their fresh lime coconut donuts makes me want to write poetry, but it looks like another reviewer has taken care of that.

So what can I say, I haven't eaten anything here I didn't like. The tacos are all delicious (though my favourite is the Yuba), and an order of nachos is filling and flavourful with spiced beans, cashew cream cheese, some kind of cheese sauce and veggies. I've been eyeing those burritos, but haven't gotten around to ordering one yet.

I'm happy to see a couple of different hot sauces on the side bench, along with a help yourself collection of water jugs. You might notice the lack of garbage can, well, everything is biodegradable. Which is awesome, but I can't help but be compelled to bring along a reusable container with me so I don't waste any more paper bags on donuts I inhale in 5 minutes anyway.

The limeade can be a bit too heavy on the agave sometimes, but otherwise I have no serious complaints. Service depends on the day and who's at the counter, but it's usually somewhere between decent and awesome.

The seating is limited to about 9-12 people depending on where you're sitting, but it hasn't felt crowded any of the (several several several) times I've gone in. There is a lot of foot traffic, people running in and out to grab a quick bite. 

The simplicity of their menu and pricing scheme is appreciated, just enough choice, without too much choice. What you see on the board, is what you will pay (tax is included), and combining donuts and tacos or beverages results in a nice round number which nutty folks like me will appreciate.

I haven't checked them out for breakfast on the weekends, but it's definitely on my to do list. Breakfast burritos... tempting, tempting.

Seriously, vegan or otherwise, at the very least pick up a donut, you wont regret it, really, go. Eat.

I've lived in Toronto for two whole years as of this month, and I have never once had  a bad time there. More often than not, we've gone there for brunch, and the service has been stellar. Not just hey they'll bring me my order the way I asked for it, but they'll do that AND be friendly, helpful, and fast. Service is great, they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating (without attitude).

A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.

I'll also say, that the food is okay. Tofu scramble is hit or miss, but usually it's decent enough that even on it's worse. I've had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians, so there is that.

I've gone with friends, I've gone with family, I've gone in pairs, I've gone in big groups. Go for brunch. It's great. Go for drinks, it's fun. 

Other stuff: Cash only (but there is an ATM inside), they have baked goods and cheesecake from Through Being Cool (vegan) bakery, and conveniently close to Nazareth Ethiopian restaurant (eat delicious Ethiopian food then go drinking).

I finally went to Burritos Boyz the other day and I was really pleased with what I got. Flavourwise and servicewise it trumps Chipotle entirely.

I got a vegan burrito and didn't feel deprived of anything, it was a nice big meal. I really liked how they constructed it. It made a huge difference when biting in. There was an intermingling of flavours rather then the usual "oh here's rice, oh here's lettuce, oh here's salsa"  feeling I get from some other places. It was quite filling, though I probably could have eaten two for lunch. I think grilling the burrito is a nice touch, crispy on the outside warm and yummy on the inside. 

They have veggie ground round, and vegan guacamole, and hot sauce that's actually hot. I wish they also had some daiya, because that would have made this place all around perfect.

We got there right before the lunchtime rush, so not only did we get our orders quickly, I even snagged a seat in the corner.

There are a few vegan options here, and they are labelled clearly on the chalkboard near the cashier (though they don't always write everything they're serving on the board). 

Service was friendly and quick, I ordered the sweet potato and rapini pie, which wasn't as tasty as the dish my friends ordered (the cauliflower and soy protein pie). They have a vegan cheesecake that is phenomenal.

It's a cozy little space, and there were a few other folks there when we walked in on Saturday, but it didn't feel too crowded.

I'll have to try their coffee next time.

I went here last week on Friday, and it was great. I wondered why it had taken me so long to actually go in (well I know why, the outside doesn't look nearly as inviting as the inside does). Menu is colour coded and vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, or non-veg friendly. There is probably something for everyone here which makes it a good potential spot to take non-veg in-laws or something. 

Service was great, our server seemed to actually like it there, and was knowledgeable about the menu.

I had the phish and chips and would totally eat them again, pretty delicious. Crispy deepfried pieces of tender tofu, with a side of chips and spicy house made tartar sauce.

I think it's time to check them out for a Sunday brunch and see what it looks like on a busy day.

I prefer this location to the other ones in the city. We live really close to the Queen West one, but order delivery or dine-in at this one.

Dine in service is always friendly, and quick. Dishes are veganizable, there are lots of options, the food is always tasty and the portions are huge (we're eaters, but we still end up taking food home with us). The food could be spicier, but that seems pretty standard in this city and nothing a bit of hot sauce can't fix.

My delivery experiences have varied. When I order things through Order-It or Just Eat,  the resulting delivery takes forever, there are often issues with our order (like egg in the pad thai when we specifically said vegan/no egg), and the prices are more expensive than just ordering directly. 

So we started calling them to place delivery orders and things went much more smoothly. Orders seemed to come faster with no mistakes.

I went to check out Kupfert & Kim today at First Canadian Place. It was reasonably busy, even at 3pm.

Service was friendly - though it seems like they have a lot of staff behind a very small counter (maybe it was shift change?) It's a very clean looking space, and I like the selection of vegan and gluten-free sweet treats, like stuff from Earth & City, Bunners Bake Shop, and Rawlly Delicious.

I ordered the "First Canadian" , and while I've often felt really bored with bowls of vegetables/grains/etc, this one was a great mix of ingredients - tempeh, quinoa,  shredded red and green cabbage, sweet potato, and a flavourful dressing on the side.

They've got a decent selection of milks (soy, almond, coconut, and  rice) for prepared coffee drinks like cappuccino, lattes, etc.  and fresh juices.

Open from 8am to 5pm, they've got breakfast and lunch menus and seem like a great option for meatless, wheatless, fare in the Financial District.

They just opened two weeks ago, so they still seem to be working out all the kinks, and they don't have a (useful) website yet, but as far as the food is concerned - so far so good!

Love this place. Sure it was way out of town for me. Sure I can't figure out a way to get there with public transit from Toronto... BUT it's worth the trip, however you get there.

To be honest, before we went there I thought it was just going to be danishes, which was actually exciting in and of itself, BUT it had a variety of other Danish baked goods (like marzipan cookies, and kransekake ) as well as vegan chocolate bars, chocolate soft serve, cookies, brownies and biscotti. And little grocery type items like fake tuna and non-dairy cheese.

The woman that runs the bakery is so sweet and friendly, I felt like I could talk to her all day about food and not get tired of it. Another great part about this place is that it's inside of a costume shop. Can't go wrong with that.

I neglected to read the reviews on here regarding the Greyhound/Toronto Coach Lines line, and stood in line (at 5am I might add, 5am does not make me a happy camper) for 15 minutes while a woman argued with the counter guy about something ridiculous. I don't envy these people their jobs, I can't imagine the crap they have to deal with.

So I came to the counter, talking about Greyhound, he told me (and it's probably been the millionth+1 time he's said this.) to go to the greyhound counter down in the waiting room and talk to the guy in the vest. Well, shucks. Who knew. 

The waiting room was clean, my ticket situation was sorted out without any issue well before my bus arrived, so I really don't have any complaints.

I really hate going through airport security, and for certain trips (like NYC for example) the rates on the greyhound are really reasonable (especially with advanced purchase), I usually don't have to sit with anyone AND most importantly (is she joking?), I can get wifi the entire way down.

I'd like to say I loved this place, because for the most part I did.

The veggie selection was beautiful, the store was bright and clean, but ultimately, all of that was ruined by my experience at the check out.

I went through the self check out, you know, so I could avoid talking to cashiers and go through the process quickly? Instead the attendant would not leave me alone and it took twice as long.

He hovered and hassled me the entire time I was going through the check out, he yelled out the veggies at me that I was buying from his station, and it was really frustrating. It totally ruined the whole experience for me. 

If I do go back, I'm not going to bother doing self check-out (and I don't recommend anyone else does either), not much point if someone is going to micromanage the entire process.

I would have given this place a five, I wanted to give this place a two after I left, but it gets a begrudging three because it has such a nice selection and a clean bright location.

First of all, this is probably the best Vegetarian restaurant I've been to in the Toronto area, and probably in my top ten of vegetarian restaurants I've been to in North America.

I took a big burly omnivore with me, and he loved everything we ordered, so I take that as a great sign.

We started things off with an order of crispy oyster mushrooms and seared dumplings. I wish we had ordered two orders of the crispy oyster mushrooms because I can never have enough, they are so rich and flavourful and the sweet slightly spiced sauce is a perfect compliment for it.

We both ordered the Special of the Day, which was a tofu skin wrapped taro root mash on a bed of greens, with a side of noodles, and a flavour explosion of a mango salad. 

Our waitress totally sold it. Her description got my mouth watering from the very beginning. It adds so much to a meal when the server is friendly, and she was wonderful. Moreover, she clearly loved the place and the food, which is exactly the type of person I want advising me on what to order.

I was feeling pretty full after finishing my plate, but there is always room for dessert. My dining companion and I shared a piece of chocolate cake and a brownie sundae (but since they were out of brownie, they used lightly warmed chocolate cookies.)  What can I say, other than delicious! delicious! delicious! 

The chocolate cake was good, but not as good as the sundae. Though I'm glad our server made sure we took the left over chocolate cake home, because while it wasn't as awesome when it went head to head with the sundae, it was fantastic by itself at 3am.

In Short: 
- order the crispy mushrooms, you wont be disappointed. 
- And the Special; it's consistently amazing.

I've been travelling a lot lately and in the time I was away having fun and eating lots of great food, Bloomers opened and I was really looking forward to coming home and visiting this (still) new vegan cafe and bakery in Bloorcourt.

So finally,I got to visit them today. 

First impressions are: I love the wide open space, that there are multiple options for seating (booths, tables, high tables, etc). They've got free wifi (I didn't look for power outlets this time). Service was really nice and friendly. And I felt pretty comfortable just hanging out with my coffee for a bit

Today I saw a couple of different kinds of donuts, fluffy coconut donut holes, chocolate chip cookies, butter tarts, blueberry tarts, BAGELS, and a donut Bread pudding, and probably more, but I was especially drawn to the bagels, as I haven't seen bagels around any of the fine vegan bakeries we have in our city AND I happen to really like bagels (and usually end up making them myself). as an added bonus they had tofutti cream cheese available. 

They've got a variety of kombuchas, teas, blue sky soda, and assorted bottled fruit juices, in addition to fancy (and more regular) coffee options. 

I hear there is a menu extension coming in September with sandwiches and the like coming soon, so I'm pretty excited to check that out too when it appears.

I liked it here, I would (and will) be back again soon. 

Accessibility-wise: Today the door was wide open (otherwise it's not powered), but there is a bit of a quarter step to get in. And  in a wonderful departure from the usual Toronto bathroom in the basement style the restroom is on the main floor.

And regarding one of the other reviews... it seems a little (no, it seems a lot) ridiculous to complain about the lack of dairy products at a vegan cafe.

I come here about once every two weeks, mostly out of convenience, since it's near my workplace, has vegan options, and offers a decent alternative to subway/sushi/pizza options I have in the area.

Service is always friendly and helpful, reasonably quick, and they don't use a microwave to heat up your samosas - which some other Indian restaurants do in the area. Ew. 

I've had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said, the curries are quite bland.  They are spiced but not really (especially if you've gotten used to more authentic little India flavours) and just generally have a "healthy" flavor to them. it's not terrible, but miss-able. 

I'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.) They do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice.

They've recently upped the price of the samosas, but 3 samosas and two chutneys will still only run you just under $5.

I like this place.  I need to go back on a Friday or Saturday night to see what it's really like, but I went a couple hours before closing on a Wednesday with Nicole H, and it was pretty comfortable with four tables occupied.

I like the interior, it seems like a place I would actually go to just drink coffee or do some work, with the added benefit of having games available if I wanted to play them.

They have a great selection of games in the back, and various events happen every week, including a Scrabble meetup group (Scrabble in the City) every Thursday night.

Beer and other alcohol selection appears ample, but since it was 3 pm on a Wednesday, I opted for tea. Prices for food and drinks are very reasonable, as of yet, there is no game playing fee.

As an extra bonus, service is friendly but also unintrusive.

No on-menu vegan food options or treats (yet), but they do make veg sandwiches with hummus, which is something.

I thought I was finished with Fresh, but a friend from out of town came to visit, and wanted to come here for brunch. So... okay, back to Fresh.

It still didn't win me over.  But this visit was better than before.

Our server was a bit weird, but ultimately helpful and friendly so that's all that matters. One of the other servers "helping" the table next to us was terrible and I'm glad we didn't have her. She seemed to be all attitude, and no help.

Brunch was great. I got the pancake platter, which comes with two pancakes of your choice, two vegan breakfast sausages and tofu scramble (for 12$). I could have done without the over-spiced boring tofu scramble, but the pancakes (banana-nut flavoured) were excellent, especially when slathered with margarine and dark rich maple syrup. Tofu sausage was fantastic.

I got an americano.  And while it wasn't a very big cup of coffee, or very caffeinated, it was very tasty.

I also ordered a side of soy yogurt, but really, I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you get some jam. It's not flavoured with anything so when you order soy yogurt that's really all it is, and it's not very good. 

Next time (since there will probably always be a next time with this place): BBQ Burger. How can I go wrong with a veggie burger, that also includes a couple of those delicious quinoa onion rings?

We went to Bello Bio earlier this month to check out their selection of products. All the food items there are vegan, and imported from Italy. The imported part sounded a little strange, since I've never thought of Italy as a very veg friendly place, but we learned from the owner, that Italy has a growing vegan/vegetarian population

Great selection of random products. They have grain based pseudo-meats, and a very interesting MozzaRisella sprouted rice based soft dairy free cheese, which made an excellent addition to a recent caprese salad. They have prepared foods, and frozen items available to take home (such as varieties of vegan stuffed ravioli.)

Those folks are friendly, and the products have a lot to offer flavourwise. And I liked that they have products that are vegan/plant-based, without depending entirely on soy.

I'm looking forward to going back and picking up more stuff soon!

We ordered delivery from this location and it was okay. But not amazing. 

I think their queen street location is better, or maybe we hit them on the wrong day. The fredo pizza is normally covered with thinly sliced potato and a nice level of rosemary and other spices, this time around, it was rather sparse. 

Considering they said an hour for delivery, and we were only 6 minutes away (if you walk), I would have expected they'd have enough time to actually cook the potatoes properly. I wish we had just picked it up, maybe it would have been better. 

They have three vegan pizza's on the menu and an extensive combination of other types as well. So I'd start the Pizziolo experience at a different location if you want something especially good. 

That said, my slightly undercooked potato pizza was still better flavour-wise than the Pizza Pizza in the neighbourhood.

Easy wasn't easy. I considered getting a smoothie and word on the street is their coffee is stellar. 

But it was busy, and after about 10-15 minutes, with no coffee, we left before ordering.

I've watch D-Beatstro improved their offerings and options over the last few months and it's been great to see them grow from sort of disorganized but charming to really having a solid menu, kitchen, and coffee set up. They have a nice variety of baked goods, occasionally have gluten-free options too for those of you that need/want them, and herbalist blended teas available. But my favourite thing now is their brunch, because it's good, really good.

Seating is comfortable and well spaced out, so if you're tired of sharing elbow room with other folks during weekend brunches - this might be a great spot to check out. The restaurant and cafe is also wheelchair and/or mobility device accessible with a ramp outside (they also have an accessible washroom.)

The folks here make a great soy latte, and why anyone would recommend going to a Starbucks or Tim Hortons over even a non-dairy latte, I don't understand, but Kevin S. you do you. They also have a variety of other fun drinks - like hot chocolate, white hot chocolate, matcha lattes, and other surprises in store for you.  They also "only" have soy, almond, coconut, and cashew. Oh no, too many options? Branch out a little.

Check em out for brunch or during the week.

You know those times when you visit a cafe or store and leave with the desire to tell everyone you meet how wonderful it is? That's how I feel about this place.

They have a great warm inviting atmosphere, and it's a cozy (i.e., kind of a small space). While there is room for about three people to sit in the window area, prepare to either stand and eat, or take a box home (or eat there, AND take a box of treats home like I did...)

The people working there are friendly and helpful, and when I walked in, all wide-eyed and overwhelmed with options, they gave me a run down of what they had and offered some recommendations. Bunner's was just all around fantastic from the start. And then... I ate one of the "gypsy" cookies, and I was completely sold. Oats, melty chocolate chips, dried cranberries and a few other things combined into a soft chewy cookie. I want to go back, right now, and get another one.

I should probably mention that in my experience gluten free tends to secretly mean gross, and I have been known to occasionally thank my body for not having celiac disease. So what I'm saying when I say this place is good, is that it's not just gluten-free good. It's actually good.

When I went in today there were cupcakes (three different kinds: vanilla, chocolate and red velvet), DONUTS, amazingly yummy cookies (gypsy cookie), freshly baked loaves of bread (which I'm kicking myself for not trying), muffins, and cookie sandwiches!

What I'm going to hope for is that every coffee shop in town starts using them as their source for vegan (and/or gluten free) treats. While they have decent enough coffee (and Silk Soy creamer is available), I sure wouldn't mind having one of their cookies or muffins with a nice soy latte. (Of course... Crema Coffee is just across the street...)

Balluchon is now i deal coffee. It's basically the same place, but better.

I love this place now, so my regular Monday Sorauren Farmers' Market visit is paired with a tasty cup of coffee from -i deal coffee- as well.

Service has been fantastic every time I've gone in. It feels like a space that's good to hang out in, they have vegan and/or gluten-free options, and have soy and almond milk at no extra charge (YEY!)

So lovely. I can't wait to keep going back.

As an added bonus, since they only recently took over that location they are part of the Indie Coffee Passport less-than-3 Edition, so you can give them a try, while taking advantage of a really great deal.

They're currently cash only, but it sounded like they were planning on getting a debit machine at some point.

You might have seen this vegan bakery win the Toronto Vegetarian Association's Vegan Bake Off (repeatedly), and you've might have seen it at the Vegetarian Food Festival, or at the Farmers Market or a bunch of other places around the city (and Ontario).

Now, you'll see it in a sweet location in the Annex.

Full disclosure: I've been excited about this bakery opening for months, and I don't care who knows it. I have wanted a source for a steady supply of vegan magic squares, and now I have one (p.s. get the magic squares)

I had the opportunity to visit the bakery during the sneak-peak opening in December, and bought magic squares (but not enough), a cookie, and a couple of candied apples and it felt like early Xmas.

Then I waited (im)patiently for their opening this month. And today I braved the snow and went in. I left with dark chocolate croissants, magic squares (obviously), and a pot pie. My partner came home with croissants, a couple of sausage rolls and a whoopie pie. Yes, we're getting ready to hibernate this weekend.

The croissants are ridiculously flaky, the magic squares are incredible as usual, I haven't eaten anything else yet, but I've sort of come to expect that anything from APiecalypse Now! will be really good.

In the fridge & freezer so far they've got (all of these things are vegan): cashew ricotta, Caesar salad dressing, flavoured butters, lasagna, pot pies, shepherd pie, gluten free and gluten-full chili mac, potato salad, tzatziki, tartar sauce, Northwood Cold Brew Coffee (which I'm drinking right now - tasty), and more.

I like that there appears to be a sincere effort made to find ethical, ecologically sound, and human friendly products to make & bake stuff, and that they have compostable packaging.

Service was friendly and fast & they take cash, credit, and debit.

There is no seating inside, so prepare to take out.

P.S. try the magic squares.

This place is huge, but lacks seating. I spent a considerable amount of time visualizing how they could fit more tables in without getting to crowded, and I can see why they set it up the way they did. But a couple more tables wouldn't hurt. (but that's what everyone says).

I love the space. Floor to ceiling windows facing Queen St and the rest is brick. High ceilings, ample bookshelves and the random old stove in the center... it just works.

I ordered a soy latte, and it was delicious, not too bitter, not too boring. Foam was nice and thick (but not too much) Just right. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have any "to stay" cups. But on the plus side, they've got free wifi and they don't charge extra for soy milk.

One thing I find really cool about Ground Level is that it operates as part of Ground Level Youth Ventures where youth learn life skills and job training (beyond just making coffee). Definitely something I'm into supporting.

I went here solely because it was part of the Indie Coffee Passport, but I'll go there again if I'm in the neighbourhood. My latte was better than the cups I've gotten from other shops in the area.

Feel Good Guru is in the progress of slowly opening.  It's a take-out place right across the street from Trinity-Bellwoods Park, and conveniently located in my neighbourhood. I walked in not caring what I ordered, I wanted to try... anything. 

I ordered the soup, which was a hearty miso based vegetable lentil, with lots of greens and packed with flavour. Perfect for today's rainy glumness.

The space is really clean and relaxing, there is seating for about 4 people, but like I said, it's styled as a take-out place (so you know, you could hypothetically take stuff out, and eat in the park.) There are fresh herbs in a wall-mounted garden (that look absolutely lovely). They also have a useful website that actually gives you the information 

I've come to expect raw cakes to be delicious, and Feel Good Guru's cake was no exception. In fact... it was even better than I expected it to be (and the raw bar is raised pretty high already.)  She gave me a sample for free, and I want more of that chocolate heaven in my mouth. Luckily they are right down the street, so I could wander over any time I want. Lucky me.

Meh. I'd feel okay just leaving the review at that. This place embodies meh, I've had better. 

I walk by every day on the way to work, so I thought... maybe this will be my alternative to Starbucks or (on days when I feel like being treated rudely) Tim Hortons. Nope.  The coffee tasted burnt, in a bad way. And soy milk is 0.70 cents extra (I hate that.)

I was oversold on the 20$ gift card. I like going out for coffee because it's relaxing - I didn't expect to have to say "no not interested" to some pseudo promotion (gift card - meh) repeatedly.

With the exception of the sales pitch,  service in general was quite friendly though. But not friendly enough that I would go back again.

This location was my first foray into the Pizzaiolo chain since moving to Toronto.

We went to this location at 3am on a Saturday night and asked for half a fredo (with potatoes, rosemary and oregano)  and half a vittoria (tomatos, zucchini, red peppers). They didn't even blink, no problem, done. When we got it, it was packed with toppings, hot and delicious. Everything seemed cooked to perfection. 

Afterwards service was a bit off, I tried to buy a drink, and stood at the counter, drink in hand while the server talked on the phone... for about five minutes. Then I put the drink back in the fridge and sat down to finish my pizza. 

On the plus side, the variety of pizza they offer is nice, they have vegan and vegetarian pizza available by the slice (amongst others), and they are open super late.

It's a Starbucks, with the same problems and benefits that every Starbucks has. The coffee is the same as every other starbucks, and they never seem to use separate containers for soy and dairy frappuccinos but they are quick, there is lots of seating, and a good collection of power outlets at this location (you just have to find them)

Overall, it's always clean, some of the staff are reasonably friendly.

No more trudging downtown to get a oily slice of potato rosemary (The Fredo) pizza for me, finally, a new Pizzaiolo up north and in my neighbourhood.

This location is clean, and at 4pm, completely empty except for the reasonably friendly dudes working there. They had a special deal going on for a free beverage with purchase for their grand opening (which is now over) but honored my request anyway. Free soda is always a plus. 

Pizza was decent. One half of the GIANT slice was perfect, the other half was more than half of my daily requirement of olive oil. Crispy tasty crust, maybe verging on too crispy, but it was still within tolerance levels. Also, I'm happy that they actually had a vegan pizza available, which is more than I can say for half of the downtown locations I've been to after 7pm. 

I'd come here again and I hope business picks up because that area has been lacking in quick tasty (vegan or otherwise) food options.

I've been going to Totum for almost a year now I think, and it's been great for seriously getting into weight lifting without having to navigate through clusters of bros and other gym jerks. Everyone is generally nice, respectful of space, and you know, no one is ever doing bicep curls in the squat rack.

I still haven't convinced myself to go on a repeat visit to any of the 6am classes, but they exist for those pre-work workout fiends. I'm just too much of a night owl. I'm also lazy.

Classes to chose from include yoga classes, Pilates, boxing, kettle bell workouts, spinning, crossfit, and a whole bunch of others. Lots of elliptical machines, 5-6 treadmills, and bikes. They also have a decent variety of weight machines, free weights, and other equipment to play with.

There is one personal trainer that without fail will change the music station from some amazing techno/dub/remix (you know, perfect workout music) to some weird classic rock/easy listening/crud, so word of advice - bring some headphones if you're going in the middle of the day. The weekend hours are not as convenient (they close at 6ish), but I do like that they're open later than most gyms on Fridays.

One other thing I like is that they have other sport related services available on site. In addition to personal trainers, there are chiropractors, RMTs, a holistic nutritionist, and an ND. It's nice to have the option of just going in, working out, seeing an RMT, or someone else, and going home.

It's clean, friendly, and welcoming. There is a free week trial, and I'd totally recommend you try it out. But only if you're awesome.

Worst/best thing - it's right next to Soma Chocolate.

I went to Nazareth yesterday and we lucked out because it was nearly empty inside (however it filled up within 30 minutes of our arrival and then there was a bit of a line.)

The service was fast and friendly, but there was a bit of a wait to get our actual plate, but it wasn't uncomfortably long. Our server checked on us regularly and was very pleasant.

We ordered one order of the vegetarian combination plate, and between the two of us, we still didn't finish all of it.

Over all it was a great experience, we got there at just the right time and the bill was ridiculously cheap.

Upon walking in I was delighted to see that they brew a very familiar coffee, Stumptown Coffee (the coffee found in nearly every coffee shop everywhere in Portland, Oregon... aka Stumptown.) The nostalgia was short lived, I think I prefer the Intelligencia coffee I've had nearly everywhere else in the city.

My barista was friendly, and helped me out right away, so that part was nice. 

They charge extra for soy milk, and in doing so, became the most expensive latte I've had in Toronto (however, I should also mention, the portion is comparatively bigger than other places so I'm not exactly complaining about that part.)

Lit has WiFi! Lots of seating, and a nice interior.

I like this place, I guess that's why I keep coming back. The seats are comfortable, I like that I can lean back, and the temperature has always been decent (unlike some places). The location can't be beat (easy access from Dundas Subway).

I know some people aren't into the "butter flavoured topping" that AMC has going on, but I love that it's available. Not that it's in anyway good for you (mmm soybean oil...), just that all signs point to its veganness, which works for me.

As with every movie theater, they will gouge you at the concession, and make you wish you had the foresight to sneak in your own snacks.

I didn't mean to go to Freshii for lunch the other day, but events conspired in such a way that I was in the neighbourhood (hoping to buy a Indie Coffee Pass from Crema Coffee - but they were sold out) and the line was short (because their debit was down) and my stomach decided it was time to eat.

After looking at the menu board, I filled out the custom order form (and there were LOTS of options to choose from.) s  and handed it to the nice server informing everyone that the debit machine wasn't working. (right at noon time! what terrible timing!)

I got the spinach wrap, grilled and filled with veggies, with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Can't go wrong with that combo. It was warm and fast. Even though there wasn't much reason to (nothing to melt, nothing needed to be cooked) I'm glad I got it grilled. It seemed to help keep the wrap together as I was running down Bloor.

If you don't feel like making up a meal for yourself they also have a huge selection of "Chef Creations" (at least one of which is vegan)  that you can modify further if you feel like it (for an extra charge).

The other benefit to this location is that Crema Coffee is right inside, so you can get a wrap, salad, bowl, or whatever AND get a delicious cup of coffee too. And by the way, Crema has one of the best soy latte's I've had in the city... though maybe I should save that for a Crema review...

Just a note, I can never get the freshii wifi to work with my iPod Touch, but I can connect to it with my netbook. Maybe it's me, but I'm just going to blame them on this one.

I love Shauna's!  The prices are great, Shauna is really nice and my dog has a good time playing there. Shauna is very knowledgeable and you can tell that she loves animals. If I had even the slightest notion that my dog wasn't being cared for, I wouldn't go there. It's too bad someone had a negative experience, but I've been here many times and have always seen the dogs in their care happy. I have sent many friends to Shauna's and am glad that she's so close by. I highly recommend!!!!

I've been going here every other week for a mani pedi for several months now.  I like the staff. They are professional and friendly. I feel comfortable there.  I like the massage chairs and the fish tank, both help me relax.  I'm a stickler for cleanliness and their tools are always sterile (autoclaved) and they use liners in their foot baths.  The service is very consistant from tech to tech, so I don't feel the need to be choosy about who does my nails.  They give a lengthier massage than most places, but I find the massages lack-luster.  That's really my only suggestion for improvement. Better massage technique.  My gel polish lasts a full two weeks and so does my pedicure (not gel).  I really like this place and will continue to treat myself to a trip to Dream Nails every other week!

We have visited many many times over the years.  I love the salsa.  The food is excellent and fresh.  I wish they would give out a larger bowl for the salsa since the small cups available are not easy to dip a chip in, however this is a small complaint.  The only other negative is the "ambience," which is lacking. Not the most comfortable chairs.  Everything I've tried has been excellent.  The staff is friendly.  Love it!  We will continue to be regulars.

We buy loaves when we are there so we can enjoy it at home. I've tried the eggplant parm sandwich, egg salad, veggie, grilled veggie and a few others and all have been excellent!  I'm a vegetarian, so it's nice to have lots of choices here.  My husband has had roast beef, Italian, pastrami and other subs and has always been happy.  I send friends and family here. Everyone has been happy.  I highly recommend Heidi's!

Yesterday I had my new patient appointment with Dr. Adams. Immediately upon arriving I was happily greeted by 3 women at a side desk. They immediately informed me that the ambulance had just left and Dr Adams was a few minutes behind. This was fine with me. There were 4 patients waiting and the office was comfortable and clean. They made sure all waiting patients knew of the situation and one by one called them back. About 45 minutes later, happily to my suprise, I was already called back!  Yolanda took my weight and BP  - she was professional and kind. She did my initial intake and we had a nice laugh as well. Dr Adams was in the room in about 5 minutes! Now where do I start. Dr Adams is very professional and thorough. She was interested in my home life and even what I was reading in the office! We discussed many options of treatment for my 3 reasons of being in the office. She gave me immediate referrals and advice that I felt was not only professional but thoughtful in her answers. She even called for my bloodwork and labs right there in the office instead of sending me on a goose chase to a random lab. She related to me and understood my past with what I felt very comfortable sharing with her. I have searched for a doctor in NV for 10 yrs. I am so pleased that I actually look forward to going back to see Dr K. Adams. You are truly one of a kind Dr. Adams! God bless you!

Today my best friend and I went to serenity nails at 1pm. They sat us down immediately. The entire place stunk of someone's lunch. They began to fill the pedicure tubs and when we asked for it to be warmer one woman began scooping the water out (while on her cell phone and chewing with her mouth open) we sat with the running water and nobody to turn it off for 8 minutes until it began to overflow. In which we recorded this embarresment of a "salon" proceeded to put on our shoes and leave. The blue pedicure water covered half of the back salon and at one point another man doing a manicure stood up, observed the mess all over the flow and sat back down to the manicure lol! If I could stand on the corner directing people just a block down to Dream nails I would pay them not to step foot in this facility. What a joke!

Went for a special occasion and let them know in advance, asked for a nice table, we were put in a corner in a cold area was so cold my shoulders hurt and feet were like ice, when I asked to move they were reluctant even though the place was far from full, they did move us however next to a drafty door. The waiter comes out overly friendly, with phoney smile as others on the staff. The truffel soup was like a bowl of salt water.  The Pasta dish was cheap dumplings with frozen peas and 2 mexican shrimps chopped up so small and yes a lot of salt. The Salmon  was bland but the mashed cauliflower under it was salty and not cooked all the way, the broclii was burned, we left half of our meals on our plates and no one asked why? The service was horrible we constantly had to ask the bus person to find us the waiter. Way Way overpriced and an added 18% service charge for poor service. They never said, thanks good bye or come again. I read so much good about The Farms that I really wanted to go, but it is a Never Again, does not deserve a 2nd chance, $180.00 for 2 and did not eat and 2 beverages. Also my stomach was very uncomforatable from so much salt,  I felt very nausiated.

I can't say enough good about this place. Oysters are always fresh and they
bring in daily from both coasts. Go on a Monday and you'll get the two for
one deal; that's 2 dozen for $30...wow!!!
As a seafood lover it has become my favorite haunt for a great meal.
My daughter (teenager ) loves their lobster poutine and I am in love
with their blue crab claw butter lettuce salade with homemade butter milk dressing.

My husband and I hired Up N Smoke for our wedding reception. They had catered my husbands work and before he even proposed he said that we should have Up N Smoke cater our wedding when that time came. SO when we were planning I made sure to hire them. I personally never tried it but I trusted my husbands tastes buds and I couldn't have been happier that we went with them. Rich was so fast to respond and to answer my questions. He was even willing to work with us around the timing of our ceremony and setting up the buffet, so we wouldn't be hearing clinging and clattering while we were saying our vows. Once everyone was served, Rich and his crew put all the left overs in tin pans and had everything cleaned up in a blink of an eye! All night I was hearing about how good the food was from all our guest, and I myself have been loving having the left overs to eat and enjoy for the last few days! I almost want to find another event soon to have to order different food from them so I can try out their whole menu!!! If you want great BBQ food, and have an amazing costumer service experience go with Rich and Up N Smoke!!

My wedding was just at Villa Tuscana this past weekend. I honestly couldn't say a bad thing about these wonderful people!! I was in a few times from when we booked them in July, and they were always so willing to sit down and talk to me about my worries and my questions. In the end the hall was decorated even better then I thought. They were so willing to help me and I had a lot of last minute minor changes and they were there helping me set up the room the way I wanted it to be!!!  I also love that the base price includes SO much. Most places that I was going to to have chair decorations it was going to be an extra charge. To do this centerpiece was going to be an extra charge. Villa Tuscana does have a deluxe package but the base package includes so much that if you can't afford the deluxe items you still can have a wide selection of choices! Also there are some great things that come with the package, the DJ is included, the cake is included, and the photographer is included.  I highly recommend taking a look at Villa Tuscana for any kind of big event that you need plan!

Great customer service! They go above and beyond with making you feel comfortable and giving you the hairstyle you ask for! Andrew did an awesome job on my husband and Mariana did an amazing job with my hair! Carlos the owner, is really sweet and makes you feel at home! Hard to trust anyone especially coming from a different state not knowing where to go! Definitely will be back!

I came here with expectations after reading some reviews here. I have to say the service was not as bad as I thought it would be. It is your average Asian resto service. Distant and quick. I got the pho with just the noodles and it was better than Pho Kim Long's! They do not give you a lot of mint and sprouts like Pho Kim Long but I am sure if you ask for more they will give you more. The large was not that big but it was enough for me. They have bigger bowls at Pho Kim Long. Over all I say its not bad. I will come back here just because the Pho was great. Service could be better but hey no one said you have to be happy at work. As long as they do their job right, you do not have to be my BFF.

Ok, the pho was not bad tasting at all. It was actually ok however 2 hours after I ate it I experienced dizziness and got nauseated and ill! I threw up all the food that I ate from that place. I do not now what that happened but it happened to me. The food was not bad and the waiter barely understood English. I cannot recommend this place after it made me so ill. I do not wish it on anyone. Be warned.

I made an appointment in the morning to see Leah in the afternoon and she was able to see me right away. It was my first time at this salon and she was great! She was very good at was she does. We talked about what kind of cut I wanted and she listened and made some suggestions. I like that she was not overly chatty and she just did what she had to do which was to cut my hair. Leah did not act like she was my bff and I like that. I did not come there to chat but to get a good haircut. 
Leah is skilled and knows how to cut coarse asian hair. She cut my hair just like the way I wanted it and she was so nice. The cut was for $30 which was reasonable and there was no push to sell you any shampoo or hair products which I really like. I dont like to be put on the spot after a haircut to buy hair products that I do not need.
I highly recommend Leah to anyone. I am so glad to have found a great hairdresser that can cut my hair the way I want it!

So we went here and we had fun. We did the $20 for 1 hour and ride all the rides you want. They had about 5 to 6 rides for kids and 2 rides for adults. Its ok. It is one of those places that you go once and then thats it. he mini carts were fun but I would not do it again. I dont know why. Maybe its the smell of the fumes coming from the carts or maybe it just did not do it for me. Even our 8 yo was just ok with it. I guess it depends on how much you like mini cart rides.

Closed for parties on the weekend and open Tue-Fri 930-1230 and 2-5pm. Call first to check the hours. Worth the trip if you want to have fun and get a work out. Dont forget socks for everyone.

Ivy is great!  The place is clean and the techs are courteous.  The only draw back is the smell of nail salon, I dont know if it is the acetone but it is strong.  An exhaust fan or opening a door will help but with the cool air outside it might not a good idea.  Overall it was not a bad experience.

I booked this hotel in a rush and my bad as I did not read the $18/night resort fee. Basically I paid $66/night to stay in this hotel. I would not have minded that if the hotel was just honest about it. I think that it was very sneaky for them to practice such a thing.

The resort is huge. It's like an apartment complex and since we arrived late at night the grounds were so dark it was tough to find your duplex like room. It was nice that we were connected only to another room. The grounds were clean and quiet. The bed was soft and comfy. The AC was cold and loud. It had room for 2 people and a kid. The furniture was old and the the tv in the living room and bedroom was ancient. I did not even try and use it. The in room safe actually uses a key..lol (not code).

The room has old stained carpet and the ceilings have beams. The bathroom was old and small. On our first night we actually had no hot water in our room. We showered in lukewarm water. I called the front desk to report it and the lady acted like I was bothering her. The next day at 830 am, thank God we were already awake, with our DND sign on the door we get the maintenance people at our door minimizing our no hot water complain. I insisted they check and surprise, surprise it was broken! I demanded to be moved to another room.

The man on the phone who moved us was probably the only normal person there. He was appropriate  and helpful.  The rest of the staff in this facility have no customer service skills. They just don't care.

They also put a $100 hold on your CC when you check in. I am waiting for them to remove that on my CC or I will definitely dispute it.

I would not recommend anyone to stay here. Except for the soft bed and extra pillows there is nothing here to write home about. There are a lot of other places in Scottsdale that will appreciate your business and you can get more for your money. Stay away!

Sushi was ok, nothing extraordinary. LIke most sushi places in LV they are owned by Korean folks, not Japanese. If you know your sushi you know it is not the same. It is ok if you want sushi on the go. Go to Raku for authentic sushi, the real Japanese style. Pricey but worth it! Make reservations ahead of time at Raku.

I do like the Bellagio buffet. Its a toss up between Mandalay Bay and Bellagio. French food is what they say this place is about. Although I do not eat any kind of seafood I have to say they have the best selection of crab. They had the Alaskan King crab and the snow crab in buckets! This place is like crab heaven if you like crab. They have melted butter that you can scoop up to your hearts content and they have champagne in a glass now not in those cheapy plastic containers they do in other casinos. I like the salad selection and of course the choices in bread. I do not eat bread although I love bread because of the high carb content but enough about that. The bread had to be tried! It was delicious, and they had real butter on the side. Soft butter, not the frozen kind. The butter was at room temperature so it was easy to spread it on your bread. Yum! 

Alright downside to this place is you have to be ready to wait. It felt like a line at Disneyland to get into one of those rides! The line was long! We waited 75 minutes to be seated and we stayed for 2 hours inside. Prepare to wait folks. It is worth the wait but do not come here starving hungry because you will wait and you will end up grouchy and impatient by the time you get to the cashier. Eat enough for about an hour wait and then be ready to feast! Happy eating1

The ramen was good. We have been to Japan and the ramen is similar in taste. The place is busy and small like they are in Japan. I recommend getting here early and be prepared to wait if you have a big party. I like their Shoyu ramen, the gyoza was ok. I thought for $5.00 it was a bit steep. I will visit again although I am not a big fan of MSG which I know for sure they have in their broth.

I have been to both locations. It has that buffet atmosphere so there you go. People taking what they want and more. My hubby likes it because you get more for your money especially for dinner. They have lots of seafood and fresh oyster that I do not eat but hubby does. I like the Mongolian bbq although I had to tell the man making it to not overcook the veggies. No salad bar and some fruits. Love the baked bananas, yum! Will go back because of the mongolian bbq.  At least I can eat something here that I like. Kids are also half price, yay!

This place is terrible!  One star is generous for this place. I hope the owners realize their place is a dump! The food is old and tasteless. Its messy and the restaurant is unkept. I cannot imagine what the kitchen looks like. They do have an "A" rating but that food is just plain bad! We used to go here years ago when it had the same reputation and quality as Asia Buffet. The place now is like the haven of people who just need something to fill their stomachs for cheap. No quality, no taste kind of food and cheap. It is sad to see what happened to the quality of this restaurant. I will never go back there unless it is a no choice kind of situation. Do yourself a favor and drive down to Asia Buffet. A few dollars more and it will be worth your time and money. There are also some very seedy characters in the resto. Bad, cheap food attracts the bad customers? lol

Great place for kids to learn how to swim. The pool is warmer than the YMCA pool which kids love. Kids can swim year long and not be cold. When they get out of the pool the whole room is warmer and the showers are nearby. The facility is clean and the workers are friendly.  Kids learn at their own pace so don't expect your kids to be like Michael Phelps after they finish their summer classes. 

I recommend year round classes if you want your child to be good at swimming. 2 months of class is not enough to make them great swimmers. I highly recommend this place for learning how to swim.

Careful about signing up with this facility. This place is concerned about profit only (selling tshirts,pants, etc.). High pressure shady sales tactics.  They make it very hard to cancel your membership.  The owners are only concerned about making money off of you IMO. Please be advised. Learn from our experience. Stay away from this place. Very disappointing.

I read a review here so I lowered my expectations when I got there. They gave me robe and your own locker to put your things in. I was so far impressed. I did not have to wait for very long at all and my therapist got me into the nice massage room right away. My therapist was ok. She was not the friendliest although I like that she was not chatty at all. Her pressure was not that firm. I guess I could have told her to give me more pressure. No water at the end of your massage like other places. She disappeared after the massage never to be seen again...lol.
The check out was interesting. There was a pimple faced teen ago boy at the desk that was not sure exactly what to say. I figured a business like this will have a receptionist all the time and not an awkward boy at the check out not knowing what to say to customers. I cannot even express anymore how weird the check out process was and the tip giving. There was no envelope to put your tip and my therapist was no where to be found! I gave her a good tip and handed it to the boy. I hope she gets it.
Overall the customer service at this place is terrible. The massage was ok. I would NOT recommend this place unless you are just desperate for a massage. This place feels like these people are just going through the motions. Their hearts are not in the right place and I did not feel any pride in their work.  It is clean though, other than that..stay away.

The place is a sit down kind of restaurant . The menu is not very helpful and the food selection is limited. I am used to Filipino food places like Fiesta Filipina where you can come in and pick any food you want quickly because it's ready. I was disappointed to see that it was a sit down place. There is also a distinct smell to the place. I don't want to say it smells bad but it was noticeably present.

My wife and I took the tour with Imbibe Tours a few days after Christmas. We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit "homey". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value. Those who love amazing wine, great food and education on how a winery runs will not be disappointed!

Weekly wine tasting events give a great chance for everyone to try wines from all over the world. $5 per person gets you a tasting of 5-6 wines. 

Brian is so very knowledgable about their wines and is not afraid to give you his personal opinion instead of the usual tasting notes you get from others elsewhere. I would highly recommend this place if for no other reason than the amazing selection they have from all over the world. Mentioning a varietal, appellation, region, food pairing or any other descriptor will get you a list of suggestions. 

I would highly recommend working through their selections...the wine cellar has some interesting finds as well.

My wife and I had an early dinner here on a Monday. The staff was friendly and helpful, but it was obvious that the other waiter was much more interested in customer service than our waitress. Our waitress read off some specials, but we overheard the other waiter reading off a much more extensive list and go out of his way to make his diners much more comfortable.

The food was OK, but overpriced for what we received. I would not recommend getting anything with snap peas as the chef does not know to trim the stem ends off of the peas. The risotto also seems to be a favorite as it is a side with many entrees; however, it is a bit dense (Gordon Ramsey would not approve). It is very obvious that they are doing their best to make this establishment work, but I think they still need to update themselves a bit in order to draw a younger crowd. At present, it is a "blue hair" establishment. This may be the image they are looking to portray and clientele they are looking to attract, but the image discourages those under 40 from dining here.

I would also look to update the wine list. At present they have a wide range, but these are the very traditional and well-known mega-winery names. I would like to see some more unique items on the list.

This stop is a gem on the strip. Situated on the second floor of the Cromwell hotel across Las Vegas Blvd from Caesar's Palace, The view is excellent. Depending on the time of day and your seating location you may even take in a view of the Bellagio fountain show. The service was a bit slow and we spent roughly 15 minutes there before anyone came to our table, but our server seemed to have a number of tables so we can certainly understand the delay. We were there for lunch and as this was a special occasion, we brought our own bottle of wine. The corking fee was a bit high (but not for Vegas prices) at $35, but it was still a steal considering that almost every wine on the list was an ultra premium wine. Once we ordered, our food came out exceptionally fast. We highly recommend the baked pasta of the day, the Buratta cheese (buffalo mozzarella), Baby Sweet Peppers and Marinated Olives. Our total dining experience lasted over 1 1/2 hrs. We were so fulfilled by the time we left. In the end, when our check came, we found that the corking fee was not on it. This may have been due to the fact that we bought so many dishes during lunch or maybe our overwhelmed server simply forgot, but we weren't complaining :) 

I would highly recommend Giada's for lunch!  All their food is fresh and homemade, which is somewhat rare these days, even on the strip.

One of the best places in Tempe to get a late-night snack that isn't horrible for you.  I'm guilty of not always (or even usually) going with the most healthy options, but the sheiftalia platter has got to be better for me than a burger and fries, right?  Their tzaziki is bomb, the sheiftalia is delicious and tender and juicy and coated in just the right amount of lemon-y-ness, and their pitas are thick and soft, the way they should be.  They're open 'til 3:30 AM, and they deliver.  If you love good food and like to eat at weird hours of the night, do it here.  You won't regret it.

This is the some of the yummiest Chinese food I've had since moving to AZ, and absolutely the yummiest Chinese delivery I have had since moving here.  I've only found three or four places total that have delivered, and all of them have been mediocre or worse, except for Asia Lee.  Everything I've gotten from them is delicious; last time I ordered Szechuan Beef, Pork Egg Foo Yung, and the free Chicken Fried Rice that comes with any order of $15 or more.  I wasn't a huge fan of the pork that came with the Egg Foo Yung, but the egg patties themselves are savory and delightful.  The Szechuan Beef is my absolute favorite, and it made a great lunch when I reheated it the next day, as welll.  I've never been inside the restaurant, so I can't vouch either way for the last review, but honestly, why would I go to the restaurant when I can have all the yumminess delivered right to my door?

Okay, so I might be a total weirdo, but I wake up craving Pei Wei's fried rice some days.  There is very little I enjoy more than waking up hungry at 10 AM on one of my days off, logging on to Pei Wei's website, and ordering fried rice just the way I like it without having to explain it to anyone and risk them writing it down wrong.  I'm antisocial, so what?  Then, I know that when they open at 11 AM they will have my very special order of fried rice hot and ready waiting for me.  The portions are huge, so a $6-$7 order of fried rice can last me up to four meals, which is an awesome [if not exactly healthy] deal.  

I don't really like much of their other food that I've tried.  There's some sort of curry dish that was nice, but I'm sticking to my fried rice with extra egg...  yum.

Their specials menu is extremely misleading -- I went there on a Wednesday, and according to the menu you get "50 cent drafts with any entree."  So I ordered an entree and asked what they had on draft.  Apparently that wasn't specific enough, because my beers were $5 a pop.  The waitress played dumb, and when I spoke to a manager he treated me like an idiot for not asking for the "draft specials" rather than the drafts.  That language is nowhere on the menu.  He told me if I didn't want to pay that much, "we were going to have a problem."  He didn't even offer any sort of discount or anything, claiming that "he didn't write the menu."  I paid and left, and I'll never go back, simply because they're purposefully misleading and expect their drunk customers not to ask questions at the end of the night. 

Also, the stalls in the women's restroom have no locks.  Charging five bucks for a plastic cup of beer, they should be able to afford to get that fixed.

This is my go-to bar.  I'm not into the scene at places where there's a lot of loud, obnoxious frat boys.  Four Peaks isn't especially quiet, mind you.  They play pretty good music for the most part, and almost every time I've started to groan because of the song that just came on, someone who works there changes it.  The service is a little slow, usually, but I honestly don't care.  The food is amazing, and the beer...  oh, the beer.  I love the Sunbru for warmer days, and the Oatmeal Stout when its chillier out.  I always end up drinking a little more than I planned because they're so delicious, and that leads to me splurging on appetizers.  My favorite is the spinach artichoke dip.  

All of their beers are worth trying, since they brew them there you're not going to get them anywhere outside of AZ, as far as I'm aware.  If you don't know where to start, for $9 you can order the sampler, and get a tiny glass of each kind of beer they brew, then decide for yourself.  

Short version: good food, good beer, one-of-a-kind establishment, go, now.

Me and a friend ordered delivery through GrubHub, which was fine.  The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. 

My friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.

I am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment. 

For a $50 delivery order, I was extremely disappointed. Worst $50 I've ever spent on a meal.

I love Dutch Bros!  I'm a dedicated punch-card holder, addicted to iced Kickers, which are their Irish-cream flavored specialty.  They're really rich though, just so you know what you're getting into before you take my advice.  They make it with cream, but you can also get it with less fatty milks (or soy milk).  If you want the full experience, get the cream though.  

I also love that their prices are all in increments of $0.25, including tax.  It's just a nice touch.  :)

Oh, what a wonderful experience.  

My boyfriend and I were going a little nuts on Groupon yesterday (I think we purchased 3 different deals) when we discovered a Groupon Now! for Thai Buffet.  My boyfriend is a huge buffet fan, and we both love Thai food.  He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.

We were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.  Joann, the owner, described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries, as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad.  We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.

My favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than "restaurant-y," for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.

As we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.  This might have been my favorite part of the meal, but it's hard to say because it was all so good.  I'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though.

Definitely will be back.  You get a great value for the price (even without a Groupon, the buffet is $9.99/person), with quality eats and very friendly service.

My main problem with the Cornish Pasty Company is inconsistency.  I've had pasties that were simply divine, and I kept going back.  Once I started getting ones that were a little icky, I just assumed they were having an off day.  I stopped going after my boyfriend and I got sick.  I really want to like this place, and I do like some things about it.  The crust on the pasties is always fab, but the fillings are hit or miss.  I always got either the Oggie or the Pilgrim, and the Oggie was more consitently good.  Once I tried the Pilgrim, it became my instant favorite since is had turkey and stuffing inside, and came with cranberry sauce for dipping.  But like I said, their lack of consistency, as well as the fact that I got sick last time I went, has made me not want to give them any more chances.

My boyfriend and I are super broke right now, so we're taking advantage of our Groupon credits.  We were hungry, and 5 & Diner was one of the Groupon Now! options.  I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.  As a side note, I had been here once before a long, long time ago, and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well.  

As a side side note, I don't know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about.

The employees are for the most part very friendly, and right now they've got some sweet deals going on for candy.  2 sodas, 2 candies, and a popcorn for $5, or 1 soda, 1 candy, and 1 popcorn for $3.  Plus they give out free gift cards for pre-ordering movies and games.  

They also have a new thing called Direct Access, where if there's a movie or game title that they don't have in the store, they can have it mailed to you within 2-3 business days for the same price as renting it in the store.  You can mail it back when you're done, or bring it back to the store for $3 off a movie rental or $4 off a game rental.  Sweeeet.

I am addicted to Venezia's.

A while back, a coworker picked up a slice for me and I was not impressed.  I don't know what was wrong with me.  

I re-tried Venezia's on my lunch break four days ago, and I have eaten there every day since.  I brought my boyfriend there, and he is obsessed as well.  I am boring and usually just get cheese pizza, but my boyfriend always gets the slice of the day and raves about it, whatever it is.  I also got the Combo B last night, a slice of pizza with a small salad and a drink, and the salad was impressively good.  The Balsamic dressing was excellent, too.  Everyone should try this place out.  The pizza slices are huge, delicious, and satisfying.

I crave Ono from time to time.  I wish it was closer to my apartment.  I still swing by for some Chicken Katsu whenever I get the chance, because it is tasty and delicious and katsu sauce is addictive.  My boyfriend is more adventurous than me, and he literally always is in the mood to go here.  He especially enjoys the spare ribs, bbq combo, and the spam musubi.  We both love the macaroni salad...  I get why someone said there was too much mayo, and I guess by some standards it's a little plain, but that's what I like about it.  People who say the rice is boring are obviously right, but they're forgetting to put soy sauce or katsu sauce or whatever they want on it.  It's plain white rice, guys, what do you think it's going to taste like?  

They also have these super tasty canned Hawaiian beverages at the counter that we both highly recommend.  

Oh, and if you have a smaller appetite, definitely go for the smaller plate option.  My eyes tend to be larger than my stomach and I can never finish the full-sized katsu plate, but the smaller one is just right (actually still a little more than I can eat, usually) and it's only about $5.  Awesome.

Amazing wine list, fantastic pizzas with unusual toppings, and gnutella crepes for dessert.  It doesn't get any better.  Not to mention that the service is excellent and friendly, and the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming, something that you don't usually experience in a place as hip as Cibo.  I get nervous going out to trendy places because I'm scared of getting dirty looks from rich people, but this was not my experience at Cibo.  Just sitting on their patio is a relaxing experience, what with the lovely foliage, glass of wine, and beardy waiter.  I always want to go back when I've got the cash.  Great for a date or special event.

Today was my second or third time coming to Paradise, but I wouldn't call it that if I had a choice.

I ordered the Chicken Katsu, which is a favorite of mine when it comes to Hawaiian food.  I was disappointed that it was especially chewy, and that they served it with BBQ sauce instead of Katsu sauce.  It just didn't taste quite right.  The lady working there wasn't particularly friendly, either.  I'll just go to Ono next time I hear the call of Katsu.

Best. French Fries.  Ever.

Also they have great onion rings, fried zucchini, hot dogs...  I don't eat burgers really, so I can't speak to those.  I am obsessed with their tuna salad, though.

I never thought I'd be ordering tuna salad sandwiches regularly from anywhere.  Tuna salad has a tendency to be that unpleasant gray or pinkish color, and have a tinge of fishiness to it, if its not fresh enough.  That is never the case at Chicago Hamburger Co.  This might sound strange, but their tuna salad is the most pleasant pale green color I have ever seen.  It's because they put relish in it.  Lots of delicious relish.  I am in love with their sandwiches, and although I used to devoutly order Polish sausages & fries, I can't turn my back on my new love.  Not the first thing people think of ordering when they come here, but it's definitely worth a try.

Same deal as everyone else.  I bought the LivingSocial deal, and emailed them through their website as soon as I got the voucher.  I never got a reply, but I didn't mind because the instructions DID say to call a specific number to schedule, as opposed to going through their website.  About a week after my initial email, I called and left a voicemail at the number listed on the voucher.  Never got a call back.  Today, my boyfriend called to try and schedule a cleaning and the number on the voucher is no longer in service.  Their website has also been disabled.  I've requested a refund from LivingSocial.

I was here for a conference in April, and this was probably the most beautiful hotel I've stayed in. The staff and service was wonderful, and the provided food was more than satisfactory. Wi-Fi was a decent speed (except in the lobby), and was free to members who join their loyalty program.

The main issue I had was with the room I stayed in the first night. It faced another room, and therefore didn't have much natural light. I also couldn't leave the curtains open if I wanted privacy. The worst part was the noise. There was a low pitched humming from air conditioning equipment outside the room. The noise wasn't incredibly loud, but it was very grating and made it difficult to get work done or sleep. 

The next day, I asked for a new room. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and did not make me feel like a nuisance. I got a room that was much quieter, faced the street instead of another room, and had better natural light. I just wish this was true for all the rooms.

Overall, 5 stars for service, 2 stars for the first room, and 4 stars for the second room.

Went to Wally's last night and all I can say is YIKES!!!!! The biggest disappointment I've experienced in a long time. What used to be this hidden gem, with the comfort of home vibe with perfectly cooked home cooked food and staff that treated you like family has now become just like every other restaurant in Scottsdale. Way over priced for poor quality of food, staff that doesn't care anymore, management that doesn't care anymore. My favorite waitress is gone, which I guess is no surprise seeing what the owner Chris did to this place. If I wanted to eat at Grassroots or Twisted Grove then I would drive a few blocks down and eat there. Wally's was something amazing, something special that is so hard to find in a restaurant these days.Now, it's ruined, now is disgusting, now it's a complete waste of your time and hard earned money. Don't bother trying it out, trust me. I will not be back to this one. I would much rather drive to the other location on Camelback that has remained the old Wally's. Way worth the drive.

I came into Wally's  last night for dinner with my wife and another couple. We were seated at a large round table in the corner on the patio. Our server Candy was amazing! What a gem she is. I have never had a more remarkable server. Seated next to us was a very large rambunctious group of ladies (if I can even call them ladies). The disgusting display of disrespect towards Candy was something I have never seen before. They were behaving like they were in a night club and to watch them bark orders at her and to treat her as if she was a slave to them was horrifying. But even more astonishing was how Candy carried herself through it all. That smile never left her face. I hope those women wake up today feeling completely ashamed of themselves, especially the one who did all of this in front of her teenage sons. I hope I never see any of the women in Wally's again and no server here ever has to go through what Candy went through.

They do a bad job of repairing flats. They'll probably make you get a new tire and that's expensive but the worst thing is the tire will more than likely have a slow leak meaning you'll probably be going back again and wasting more time. That is what happened to me.

Just go.  Unbelievable duck tacos, sublime filet (really how does one make onion rings so good you want more? same for the grits, good grits-WTF?).  Fiance said lamb was so good she didn't know that lamb was supposed to taste like that.  Service great, attentive without being a pain.  Sit outside if you can, inside is noisy and small but smells really good as the kitchen is pretty open (no doors between it and dining).  This was top 3 in my memorable dining experience. ( Everyone has a bad day I guess, hence some of the bad reviews, but go. )

We love Shauna's doggy day care! It's close to home, and her hours are convenient. And she offers half day services which are quite useful when you just need to run a few errands but don't want a crazy puppy on your hands when you get home! She has supplies, but we haven't bought anything yet, although we plan too. Also offers grooming service, which we haven't used either, but will in the future.

This place is as good as they say it is, and more. We've been there twice. Once with another couple who were grumpy about the whole experience and thus made our experience less than par. We were expecting the wait, but they were still irritated about it. They weren't nice to the staff, the staff thus wasn't nice to us. 

However, the pizza is absolutely amazing. So, we went back a second time, just me and my husband. Our experience was much more delightful. We enjoyed a bottle of wine during our three hour wait (and therefore were not drunk as one reviewer suggests) and excellent conversation. The ambiance is wonderful. The staff was very friendly since we were friendly to them. We were not rushed to eat quickly, although the pizza is so good it is hard not to shovel it in your mouth! Overall, we were quite pleased and look forward to going again. 

I'm not sure how one reviewer said it cost her $70 for her meal. Pizza's are $10 to $12, I'm sure soda isn't all that expensive, and salads range from $6-9. Must have left a pretty good tip! 

We've had the Biancoverde and Rosa, as well as the Spiedini for an appetizer. Delish. I just love this place and wish I could go more often. It's how pizza should be made!

I love local business. Especially when they have great customer service like Toshi's! 

I too have had the green tea smoothie, and what a delightful treat it was! I've also had their blended coffee, and iced coffee. Both far exceed the quality of that "S" coffee place. What's so great about the blended drinks at Toshi's is that they *shock* actually blend all the ice!! At the "S" place, I usually have chunks of ice at the bottom which greatly annoys me. Not so at Toshi's! And they always toast the bagels, which is great. They have limited outdoor seating, and they don't mind if you bring your well-behaved dogs. 

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the most important part....they roast their own coffee on site!!! So you know that you are getting very fresh coffee. And you can tell....the taste is so smooth and not even a little bitter. 

Now what are you waiting for? You know you want to go to Toshi's!

Paradise is good. Wildflower is better. But there is no Wildflower in Surprise, so Paradise it is! 

As others have said, the tomato soup is quite delicious. I'm also a big fan of the salad with cranberries....but the name escapes me right now. The turkey wrap is average...lacking flavor. The breakfast quiche is also average. I think mine had been sitting out for a while, so maybe a fresh one would taste better? Cookies are good, but it is hard to screw up cookies. 

The salads are gigantic. Seriously, who needs a salad that big? I guess if you want it for lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day, what a deal! 

It can be a bit confusing the first time you are there since there are two lines, but you figure out that one is for the bakery, one is for the rest of the food, cafeteria style.

Why do I like Wildflower better? I think their sandwiches are better, and the soup as well. The only soup I like at Paradise is the tomato soup. The others are lacking. I need flavor! I like the ambiance at Wildflower better too, although there is much more seating at the Surprise Paradise vs the Goodyear Wildflower. 

Overall, not a bad place to get a fresh salad for lunch.

I should have read reviews before heading here. I had heard from several folks that this was a good place to eat, and we had heard that the wings were out of this world. Yeah, not quite.

First of all, the ambiance is not that great. Lots of small, loud children. 

The service was very average. We had three servers ask us if we had been helped yet, which I suppose is a good thing, but they all seemed very confused and not sure if we were their table. But good that they asked. Our actual server took quite a while to greet us, and of course he forgot my water. Brought the beer though! 

We started with wings and we wanted to split them...two flavors. At first he told us we couldn't do that, even though it says right on the menu that you can. He made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by splitting them for us! They tasted more like chicken fingers and not wings. Way too much breading. 

I had the California burger, hubby had the fish and chips. The burger was overdone, but I expected it would be so I ordered it medium to get it to medium well. It was well done. Thankfully I didn't order well done! Otherwise it wasn't bad for this kind of place. I also order the potato chips as a side since they make them there. The chips were burnt.  The fish was seriously over breaded (apparently they like doing that here) and way too big. The baked potato and cole slaw...very average. 

Now all that being said.....our bill was very cheap ($33) and that included two beers, wings, and two entrees. 

Want cheap food and average service? Go here! Otherwise, try somewhere else.

We went here for a belated Valentine's dinner. It was fantastic. Parking was a pain, but we eventually found a spot. They seated us immediately (we had reservations) and our server was very attentive. They immediately brought out bread (delish) and water. Not long after, our wine arrived. Speaking of wine, don't be scared when you see the wine list...I didn't see any wines by the glass, only bottles, so I simply told the server what I wanted, and there it was! 

I had the tagliatelle (sp?) pasta with wild mushrooms. SO good. I'm a big fan of earthy tasty yumminess, and this hit the spot. Why can't I do this at home?? Oh, and the soup... divine! The special was potato and leek soup. Perfectly smooth, must have been strained several times to get it this smooth. Very comforting. Hubby had the mac & cheese for an ap...YUM! That Vermont cheddar is just too good! He had the pork chop for his entree, and I will never be able to make pork chops at home again. Oh well! He thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert we had the Iron Chef apples, which were perfect. We were pretty full by this point, but these three adorable little tasty apples were just the right finishing touch.

The second best part of our night (the food was first, of course) was meeting Mark Tarbell! I tried not to act like a fool, but I watched him on Iron Chef, so it was cool to meet him! He was very friendly, very down to earth, and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience. He was walking around to all the tables...great chef! 

So for a nice night out, you can't beat this place. Enjoy!

We had a fantastic experience here! We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great. 

I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't! Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience.

Mmmmm.......bread......

Oh, sorry, I'm supposed to be writing a review. Wildflower is easily our favorite place for lunch, and breakfast too. This place is always clean, always busy, and ordering is always easy. 

We usually get the same thing every visit, since it is so tasty. We both get the potato cream cheese soup, no matter what time of year (yes, it is that good!), I get the chicken and feta, and hubby gets the BLT. Even at half size, these sandwiches are plenty to fill up on. And, if we feel we can spare the extra calories, we will get a cupcake to go. YUM! I've also had a salad, can't recall which one, but it was fantastic as well. Sometimes we'll also get a loaf of bread to go, and we've varied the kind, all have been great.

Now breakfast...ah, that was just divine. I got the lemon ricotta melt in your mouth pancakes with fruit topping. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! And I got the apple sausage on the side. It was a little dry, but no matter since I was so full on the pancakes. All I needed was a mimosa.... Moving on, hubby got the banana walnut pancakes, which werer also oh so scrumptious. 

So, we love supporting this place, and think it kicks Paradise's butt. We are wishing and praying that they would bring one to Surprise, although that might not be good for my waistline....

I love the ice cream here! Course, I've never seen baby roaches, thankfully. While the place isn't spotless, it is clean. I love the decor... very charming, and the employees are always friendly. I've had shakes and sundaes here, both have been very good. Also, they sell "pup cups"...a frozen yogurt treat for your four legged kids! My dogs love these pup cups, and at $1.25....it's a great treat for them when it is so hot out! And it is a local store...so all the more reason to support it!

I've been to Babbo's several times since it is so close to my house. My two favorites are the Pasta Martini and the Gorgonzola Salad. The bread is excellent, and I've had no issues with the wine, so maybe I've been lucky? I've also had their pizza, I can't recall which one, but it was excellent with peppers and goat cheese. The ambiance is great as well, and prices are very reasonable. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service has been sketchy at times. But, it isn't so bad that we won't return. Overall, a good place.

I have mixed feelings about this place. I love the concept, but the owner seems to only provide good customer service to his "important" customers. I've been in here several times, and each time I felt as though he didn't really want us there. My dogs are well behaved, and I've promoted his ice cream socials (and told him so) but I still felt as though I was not welcomed. I may not be as regular as some customers, but I still deserve good customer service. I'm not willing to pay high prices if I don't get good treatment. I want to support his business since he is local, but apparently he doesn't want my business.

We checked this place out to compare prices to Target and other grocery stores. What I found....prices are essentially the same. Since I enjoy shopping at Target so much more (it is my happy place!) I will continue to shop at Target and the grocery store closer to my house. The good points....It is clean and well organized, and in the frozen section the lights don't come on unless you are standing in front of it. Nice touch...keeps the food in a dark cold area, while conserving energy. But, Walmart just isn't my thing, and if the prices aren't cheaper, then off to Target I go!

We've only had Bronoc's once. We had it delivered, and it was average pizza. The sauce was too thick and too much tomato flavor, the crust was average as well. It tasted more like certain chain pizza stores that I avoid, but it is a step up from them since their cheese tasted better. But I am a major pizza addict (usually make my own) so I am very particular. Their customer service was good, and the pizza was hot when it arrived, but the taste just wasn't that great. It's been a while since we tried, maybe we'll try again sometime and see if it has improved.

Ok, so service isn't always the best. The workers can often be clueless and even rude. Luckily, I know Target very well, so I don't need these workers! I can find it myself! The cashiers are hit and miss. Sometimes they don't even mutter "hello", but whatever, I'm at Target. Yeah, it's my happy place. They always have fun stuff and great prices. Things are always well stocked (at least the workers have that part figured out). I can easily drop $100 here even though I just went in for toothpaste. How? It's one of the mysteries of the world, I suppose. So when I'm trying to save money, I don't go here! If I really need something, I do not, repeat, do not get a cart, but a basket! That way I can't fit much in my basket. 

I think Target is a girl thing. Guys don't really get it. But if you are a girl, you get it. It's Target.

We've been to Tokoyo lobby twice. Both times were great. I'll start by saying I gave it four stars instead of five because it is small, small, small inside and the ambiance isn't fantastic. But the things you must do for good sushi! 

I can't recall for certain the name of our favorite roll, but I believe it was the Glendale roll. Deep fried goodness is all I can say! I know, it isn't traditional sushi, but I just can't do raw fish! Nuff said. We tried two other kinds which were good as well, but the deep fried goodness overshadowed the other ones and I have erased them from my memory. 

The pot stickers were ok, not fabulous. The green tea was great and came in cute little tea pots. I haven't had sake here and I don't know why, since I usually get sake. Guess I'd better head back for some more sake and sushi!

Vogue Bistro is by far the best restaurant in Surprise! Why, you ask? Oh so many reasons! Let's begin...

1) It is not a chain restaurant! It is locally owned by a well trained chef. 

2) The Food. Ok, maybe this should be number one, but with the dominance of chain restaurants in Surprise, I think it is important that it is not a chain. But the food is FANTASTIC. I haven't had a thing I didn't love. My favorite is the Vogue Burger. It's big, but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it. The toppings are perfect, not overwhelming, and the meat melts in your mouth. All that yumminess for only $8!! What a deal!  I've also had the sweet potatoe fries (make sure you ask for the dipping sauces), the garden panini, the chicken panini, and the chicken salad (yes, we've been there a few times!) All were fantastic. 

3) The alcohol. No, I am not an alcoholic, but this is worth mentioning! The drinks here are great. I usually get wine, while my hubby will get beer. Both lists are great and reasonably priced (a great white wine for $6/glass). Also, the martinis are fabulous. They shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties. But, what I love most about the martinis is that they are sweet, but not blast of sugar sweet. Often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor. Not here! They are just perfect.

4) It has very chic decor. Lots of outdoor seating which isn't great this time of year, but is fabulous when Arizona has nice weather. When does that happen again? Moving on...

5) The manager and owners are awesome. We haven't been there once that they didn't stop by for a chat.

6) It is local! I am a huge supporter of local businesses, which can be extremely challenging in Surprise. 

Ok, now for a couple minor negatives. These are not significant enough to drop the star rating, in my humble opinion. 

1) Sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking. I think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning. So, we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation. 

2) It can be crazy busy. I guess that isn't a bad thing necessarily, but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to Vogue. Luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there. 

So there you go. The best restaurant in Surprise....you will wonder what the heck it is doing in Surprise. It is more Scottsdale-like, but without the snobbiness (no offense to you Scottsdale folk!).

Ok, normally I like to support local over big chains, but I've always had a good experience at this PetSmart. The cashiers are always friendly, the store is clean, and most of the time I can find what I need (minus one time they were out of vitamins). I wish they had more organic and natural products, but since I feed my dogs mostly fresh food, this isn't an issue. They have a great selection of holiday items, so I am looking forward to what they have this year! And I've had no problem returning items if I needed to. Plus, they have adoption drives!

We absolutely love Sprouts! We shop here almost exclusively (only at other stores for things that we can't get or the price is too high to justify...but that includes very few items). The produce is always fantastic (and cheap!!), then meat is so tasty and fresh, and the cheese....oh I just love the cheese section! The cheese is cheaper than what you will find at other grocery stores...we did a price comparison. I know when I shop at Sprouts I am not getting overly processed, full of preservatives. I am getting fresh food!! What a concept, huh? And the bulk section is fantastic. I love being able to buy spices and flour and anything else you can think of (especially the chocolate covered toffees!!) in just the amount I need. Then it is always fresh and I don't have to wonder how long I've had that dried rosemary! And, it is a local Arizona store, which makes me even happier.

I went to Tomo with a very large group (around 18 folks, we had a reservation). Things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks! After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. 

Moving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. 

Bottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.

Not for me.  They sit you on a recliner, wet your feet while massaging your head (felt like they were shampooing me) -- very uncomfortable position for my back.    Then the masseusse asks you to turn over while fully reclining the chair and works your back with the elbows.   I did not like it at all, felt like it was too rough on me and am already showing a couple of bruises.  I paid $36 for the 1 hour including 30 minutes back massage.   Too loud, no privacy, cells ringing, employees talking in a foreign language, just too disturbing and I also have a headache now.  I am an expert on Swedish and Thai massages, on a massage table with the masseuse using her hands and a complete silent environment but this was a far cry from relaxing.  The masseusse was a sweet lady but the experience was not good at all

The food was AMAZING! I got the steak "hand-held" with a homemade bleu cheese sauce. It was unbelievable and the beer selection was great. If you get Mac and cheese and like heat, try adding just a touch of siracha sauce, two-thumbs up. The plates were moderately priced but a little steep if you were expecting pub prices, $14 for my sandwich. Good for me though I had bet my friend before we went in about the quality of food and I WON!! the food was great, wish I had a local bar like that in my neighborhood

This was ok. Not great but not horrible either. The sushi is good for a sushi fix, but I don't think it's as fresh as Saga normally is. The service was bad. I'm sure it was our section or something. But two tables that were seated after us were served before us. We're not that picky so it didn't bother us too bad, but it was at least 10 minutes before we got drinks. Other than that, if you're looking for a chain sushi place to get some ok food that will hold you over then this is good for that.

Studio 3-26 was a great salon for my 13 year old niece! She wanted to go short and that's exactly what she received! Karen was her stylist and she was phenomenal! Very welcoming and sweet towards my niece! However, when we walked in another stylist was dying her hair and her kids and significant other were receiving haircuts from here when clients were waiting. A bit of time passed and all of a sudden another stylist started to fix his own hair up. So at this time, 2 stylists were doing their own hair. As time goes on, the male stylist starts to smoke his E-Vape IN THE STUDIO!!! The work they do is quite incredible, however they need to work on professionalism.

Out of convenience while staying at the Wekopa hotel, my wife and I dined at the Ahnala Mesquite Room thinking it a risk based on some negative Yelp reviews.  My wife had the Halibut and I had the Filet Mignon we both found our meals delicious, flavorful with a flair, and served hot!   The artisanal dinner rolls were piping hot and we particularly enjoyed the seeded rolls.  My Filet was well seasoned and covered with blue cheese crumbles that I crave.  The hollandaise sauce for the Filet and asparagus was a nice addition.  If you are nearby, take a risk but know that our gamble paid out a jackpot of a meal.

What a disappointment!  Bought a water lily on Mother's Day and it's not growing.  When I called about the guarantee, was told I never should have planted it that early so the guarantee is void.  When I bought the lily, specifically asked the clerk if it was OK to plant that day and he said it was.  Now they won't replace the plant because I should have known not to plant so early.  Tricker's, really?   They're living up to their name.

Absolute worst nail salon experience of my life, I will never go back. I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt "oops" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say "that's not almond" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says "hurry up" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies "oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right. As a bonus not even two weeks later I had a nail break off, ridiculous.

What appeared to be a minor fender bender turned into a bit more. I originally took my vehicle to the insurance company recommended collision 'experts' and was told it would be $600.00. Figuring this was ridiculously low I took it to Sudden where they concluded the damage was more extensive and proved it to the insurance company (over $2000). They treated me how a customer should be with patience, respect and excellent service...from taking me to the car rental company and waiting until I had the key in my hand to a excellent repair with a extra repair throw in at no charge.

Went with my daughter tonight and was refused due to her under the age of 21. Both employees were very gracious in explaining the NV law and offered for us to wait in the foyer if we wanted something to go (which we didn't). A few other reviews mention the smoky atmosphere which it true but again not there fault since that's there decision on how they have licensed there business. Vegas could use a family friendly Stieners because there food is consistently excellent (on all my previous visits).

It is very nicely decorated, staff greeted us right away.  There are TV's in each booth so you feel like your at home.  The Pizza was to die for, we absolutely loved it and it is now our weekly stop.  You won't be disappointed!

My daughter and I love this place. Let me say that again: we LOVE this place.  It is the coolest thing since frozen yogurt.  I just found out there are different classes, and the latest one is cake decorating.  Never in my mind did I see myself use fondant...but here I am now.  I've make flowers, animals, and figurines.  And it's not just a one day course.  It's once a week for several weeks.  They start you out on basics and each week the techniques get more difficult.  The fondant days are the last days.  I can't wait until my next class!

Had such a great experience at Men's Wearhouse. When we walked in, we were greeted by the manager who was very attentive and paid attention to what we were looking for. He left us alone when we were browsing and helped when we were looking for sizes. 
His name was Jeffrey Demoure and was great. 
When he found out that my husband  was a police officer he very respectfully shook his hand and thanked him for his service. When we cheeked out, Jeffery gave us a discount for my husband's service. It was really sweet and we will ABSOLUTELY go back again

I was on a business trip in Montreal and I made reservations for dinner 2 weeks prior. This was my first visit to APDC and the place was just buzzing with energy and the sweet smell of pork. Order the bison tongue as an appy and it was outstanding.  My friend had the seared foie gras and he kept rolling his eyes in delight. The bottle of wine was a beautiful Cote du  Rhone Quartz which paried very well with the meal.  For main, I had the maple pig's foot.  The presentation is shocking... the whole trotter in a cast iron pot with all the trimmings.  The taste was insane.  Skin was sweet and crunchy while the meat was juicy and savory.  The mash potato at the bottom soaked up all the essence from the dish. Very indulgent.  Brought 2 cans of duck in a can and flew them back to Vancouver.  Split one can the next night with 4 senior citizens and they were very impressed.  Gave the other one to a friend and she had hers 2 days later and it was still amazing.  Verdict:  These cans do travel so long as you keep them cold.  They are good for at least 3 days.  How do they stuff all the duck and foie gras with all the tirmmings in a small can?

I'm from Vancouver and have tasted all the ramen shops from Kintaro to Sanpachi.  Vancouver provides a wide array of ramen shops within a 1 mile radius within the downtown area.  While on a business trip in Toronto, I went in Kenzo for a late night bite and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the soup was steaming hot and had lots of death.  It was every bit as good as the Vancouver ramen shops.  Very impressed.

Terrible service period, since we don't speak taiwanese people that showed up after us got seated before us. They got their food before us, the place is dirty. We waited at our table for over 10 minutes before ever being acknowledged (I'm pretty sure it would have been longer if we didn't go up to the cashier trying to order), the table we had to run and claim ourselves. The yelp location of the place is completely wrong so a couple of u turns had to happen. Waited forever for the food after waiting a lifetime to even put our order in. While waiting watching more people who arrived after us get their food.  The food is not worth going through all the crap.   And the check was wrong.

The food here is fresh and the coffee is delicately prepared. Thank god for Ilys Italian roast! Oliver is a very respectful host and super friendly. Every time I come here the service is friendly but a bit on the slow side since lunch is pretty busy.

Definitely try their eggplant and ANYTHING with pesto, it's delicious and the proportions are perfect for lunch! The seafood bisque is rich and creamy. If your feeling sweet try their monkey latte.

My only peeve is that this place is a little awkward to get to and it's tucked away on the side of a freeway and corporate offices.

BEWARE!!  People at the store were helpful, but they charged my card the minute my order was placed online (on a weekend, when they couldn't be reached by phone), despite my explaining in the comments that I wanted to confirm the color before the order was completed.  They did call to discuss the color, and even sent photos to help me make a decision (especially since shipping to California was VERY expensive).  I got back to them - via e-mail - that I appreciated their help (which I did) but that I was not going to complete the order and, instead, continue to look for a color closer to what I was after.  I said that, if I decided to go with the alternate they suggested (different type of yarn and color), I would get back to them but, for now, I wanted to keep looking.  They responded by saying to let them know, and how nice the other yarn was.  Two weeks later, I get a message that they've shipped yarn to me!  I immediately contacted them, saying I had canceled the order - that I had told them I was going to keep looking and had not accepted their suggestion, but their response was that it'd been two weeks so they automatically shipped.  I'm guessing they've sent the yarn I initially chose online....I have no idea!  They sent me no warning - no confirmation that they were going to ship....and that's when I discovered they'd charged me for the order the minute it was placed - NOT when it was shipped like every other company I've done business with online.  I'm EXTREMELY disappointed and will never do business with them again!  Beware if you give them any credit card info!  They'll use it whether you want them to or not, and the minute they have it....even when nothing has been settled or even shipped yet!!  To return it, and pay shipping twice would cost more than the yarn so I've been FORCED to make this purchase, even though they led me to believe I would not be.

I have been eating here for years.  While the ambiance is not great, the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable.  I have probably eaten every item on the menu, lunch and dinner, and never been disappointed. 

I am a bit of a Thai aficionado, originally from NY.  Bangkok Ocha is better than most.  I have had better Thai at significantly higher prices in Florida and California.  There are a couple of places in an Atlanta that are as good but overall this is a terrific "once a week" (at least) spot.

While I understand reviews are subjective; the details in some of these reviews, what was ordered and the comments, suggest input from Thai posers and dabblers rather than addicts.  I am the later.

Smokeless Joe gets 5 stars for being one of the greatest concept restaurants I've been in...ever.  I completely understand and accept that my sense of Smokeless Joe's greatness is directly attached to my own love (LOVE) of a good pot of mussels.  Their African Peanut soup is also great, which makes me assume that the other stews and soups are too.  Additionally, I find the beer list here suits my taste better than any other I've found in Toronto so far, and the fact that the beeristas are willing (and required) to leave their bar fortress and go to the fridge at the back of the store makes me feel grossly indulgent asking for some of their bottled speciailties.  My one request for these guys is to find a way to add some pommes frites to the menu...but I'll be back weekly regardless.

I had New Ho King delivered.  I did not/do not/do not plan to go to UT.  Those things said, and understanding there may be some ambiance-related pieces I am missing, the food was not so good although delivery service in both depth of menu (its like a road map of food....just keeps on unfolding) as well as open hours was impressive.  I would not totally rule out ordering here again...but it's going to have to be pretty late at night and probably a push between being conscious or passed out when the food arrives.

As a hockey venue, this is as good as it gets (for a new arena...the Joe is still the best for obvious reasons).  On top of great seating, there are HUGE beers to be had, which reduces the impetus to leave one's seat and they also have a mean poutine, or heart attack fries as I like to call them.  Great entertainment value all around.

I would give 3 starts, but they carry my favorite hard-to-find Danish beer (Tuborg) and that yields an extra star.  The moules (mussels) are definitely worth the 4 stars as well but the large party (read: non-cozy) atmosphere just doesn't quite fit the menu.  I think things here are a bit overpriced as well, but when you look around and see 10,000 sq ft of party space, it's easy to understand.

Four stars for the food here, one star for the drinks.  The food is delish- favs include the kale & sweet potato wrap and the bbq chicken wrap.  My issue is with the juices... $11.25 for fresh pressed pesticides.  You cannot charge that much for a juice made with conventional (NON organic) produce and position yourself as a health conscious restaurant catering to that clientele.  People who can afford a $12 juice are smart enough to care where this guy sources his ingredients from.  Also worth noting that the meat is not organic either, so the whole concept is a little off for me.

Todd English's latest is incredible!  Great atmosphere (cool bar, outdoor pub tables, red leather booths inside) and our server (Paul) was phenomenal.  Expansive bar and a huge selection of beers on tap, including some very enticing samplers.  No blue cheese olives for the martinis (bummer, since that's a signature drink at Olives).  Prices are high, as to be expected in City Center.  The seafood is the freshest I've had in all of Vegas- it's flown in every morning.  Their live bar comes by the piece- east and west coast oysters and delicious jumbo shrimp cocktail served on a gorgeous platter over ice and garnished with sea plants.  The duck buns were incredible- the meat was sweet and tender and the buns were like soft little pillows!  I've been dreaming about these ever since and I plan to come back for them!!  Lobster rolls were delicious- sweet rolls lightly buttered and grilled, then stuffed with lots of sauteed lobster meat.  The coleslaw they were served with was the best I've had.  The moules frites (mussels) came in a rich, delicious curry broth and even the fries were perfect.  We also had the pickles (three house-made varieties, thought they came with bottled mustard and not stone ground).  The smoked salmon quesadilla was incredible- with buttered yukon golds and fried capers.  They also do a fabulous bread pudding that is served with fresh whipped cream, salted caramel ice cream, and a delicious toffee sauce.  The bread pudding itself was the perfect texture and is one of my favorite desserts in all of Vegas.  This place rules, I cant wait to come back and try the carvery menu- chose your meat, sauces and bread.  Definitely recommended.

BEST DONUTS EVER.  Seriously... they're amazing.  Huge selection of every variety imaginable- IF you come early.  Favs are the apple fritters (they let you chose from lighter or darker ones, depending on how done you like them), and their old fashioned buttermilk.  The donuts on the top two rows of the case are vegan,  but you'd never know it.  Their chocolate glazed cream filled (soymilk) and glazed raspberry jelly (gelatin-free) are crazy good.  I dream of these things.  Hole-in-the-wall smack dab in Chinatown.  The owner & her husband are as sweet as can be.  I only wish they were open 24 hours!

Love love LOVE Sambalatte!  Vegas has been lacking cafes like this one! I go here multiple times a week and everything has been perfect.  They have many different coffees brewed through various unique processes that make a French press look run of the mill.  Cappuccinos and lattes are full bodied and strong, and they have designs in the foam.  Great hot tea selection available in french press pots, and a delicious iced green yerba mate.  They have sandwiches (good caprese one, heated and served with a side of balsamic) and lots of desserts- including minis (napoleon, eclair, tiramisu cups, etc).  They also have gelato and sorbet, and my husband's all time fav- affogato (gelato with a shot of espresso poured over).  The atmosphere here is charming and warm, and they are open till 10pm wed-sat.  Service is excellent, they always walk upstairs to bring me my drink and are super friendly.  There is free wifi and an entire long table downstairs with multiple plugs for laptops.  Only negative is that I wish they stayed open later on weekends, especially for Vegas 10pm is early to close!

Marche Bacchus has a gorgeous view, but the food does not stand up (as is often the case).  The quality was average at best.  The lobster croissant that everyone raves about was terrible- a stale croissant unnecessarily toasted and filled with lobster meat that tasted fake.  It was shredded and almost had the texture of "Krab".  Very unappealing, and a very poor rendition of a lobster sandwich.  The signature bread pudding was also sub-par, burnt on top and dry throughout.  Definitely not worth the pre-ordering and 20 minute wait.   Service is disappointing, however the wine store is lovely and has a nice selection at reasonable prices.  The view is great and they have misters (major bonus in summer time), but next time I will be trying Garfield's next door in hopes of a better meal.

Great pet boutique.  They carry all the hollistic brand foods, including the standard Wellness Formula and the grain free variety.  They have a great selection of treats, both bagged variety and behind their bakery counter.  They also have a nice selection of toys, harnesses, clothes, and bath products.  I love this store- prices are reasonable and staff are always friendly and knowledgable.  Highly recommended for anyone who feeds their dog/cat healthy food and treats!

I am updating my review of Luv-it... still the best frozen custard in Vegas (by a mile).  However, it is super lame that they use styrofoam cups in this day and age.  Polystyrene is not accepted by recycling (Waste Mgmt) in Las Vegas, it's a possible carcinogen, it's made with petroleum, it is clogging our landfills, ETC. (google it!).  With so many eateries going green and switching to eco-friendly packaging, I wish Luv-it would too.  This guy sells a ton of custard every day and I cant imagine how many of these cups he goes through.  You gotta get with the times!

MAD LOVE for the slider truck.  What a great concept, I am so glad this place is getting the attention it deserves.  Finally we have a gourmet mobile restaurant!  The weekly schedule is posted on their website www.slidinthru.com and on twitter.  My fav is the caprese (grilled eggplant, mozarella, toms, basil, balsamic).  They also have a pulled pork slider, a beef one with tzatziki and feta, a bbq one with carmelized jalapenos, and a classic with cheddar, bacon and special sauce.  Supposedly they are going to start doing a chicken one too- fantastic news for me and my husband since we dont eat red meat!  Their buns are great and everything has a really nice smokey flavor from the grill.  They have regular fries, and really good sweet potato fries (tossed in cinnamon and sugar).  Only thing I wish they had is unsweetened iced tea, and I am looking forward to more chicken and fish specials.  Prices are reasonable, ingredients are high quality, and these guys (especially Ric) are total chillers.  There is always a line and your sliders are made to order, so be prepared to wait a couple minutes.   If you haven't been here, be sure to check it out.  I cannot give this place enough praise, mad props for a guy in his 20's acting on a really great idea- Vegas SO needed this!

Mad Hatter cupcakes are not good.  I have tried every cupcake bakery in Vegas and these rate at the bottom.  They use oil and poor quality ingredients and their cupcakes look very unrefined (almost unappetizing).  This would be a cute place for a cheesy kid's birthday party because you can customize your own cupcake (cake, filling, frosting, and topping).  Unfortunately their cakes are tasteless and the frosting is overly sweet.  These dont hold a candle to The Cupcakery, Sprinkles, or any other decent joint.

Olive's is a fantastic restaurant, exactly what you'd expect from Todd English.  The flavors are somewhat mediteranean and they've got a great menu.  Their cocktails are fabulous, I love their white peach belini and my husband is crazy about their dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  The bread basked comes with fresh baked onion foccacia and two kinds of olive tapenade.  They have some really good apps, including a great ahi tartare and some really nice flatbreads (one with proscuitto and figs, another with mushrooms, and a great classic tomato-basil-mozarella).  Favs on the dinner menu include the scallops (perfectly seared, served with risotto), the butternut squash tortellini, and the chestnut ravioli (served on a bed of creamed spinach-heavenly!).  Do not skip dessert here- they have a souflee that is crazy good.  Flavors change but the strawberry is incredible, so is the vanilla.  My husband and I order two, that's how delicious they are.  Service here is always great, very attentive.  I recommend sitting on the patio, it's much more private and has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and water show.  Definitely make reservations or you could be waiting 2 hours for a table.

Great coffee shop in the Henderson part of town.  They have really good iced tea, avaiable in 3 flavors- including unsweetened peach black tea and passion berry (amazing!).  Their coffee is fair trade organic and varies daily.  They have a small selection of pastries and some breakfast and lunch options (vegan friendly).  They have a good breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, beans, cheese, fresh avocado and lots of spinach.  There are comfy seats and a bookcase full of books, however they are only open till 8pm.  Awesome eclectic staff, super friendly and knowledgeable about their coffees.  I wish they had a larger/better pastry selection and were open later.  We need a place in Vegas that is comparable to the living room in SD, and this is the closest I have found so far!  I so wish they'd open one in the Summerlin-ish area!!

Original Pancake is one of the best breakfast places ever.  They are a chain, and their locations in Rancho Santa Fe (SD), Palm Desert, Chicago, etc are all way more charming than this one.  That said, breakfast here is always consistently delicious and the service is great.  Their omelettes are fluffy and baked with the ingredients inside, almost like a souflee.  They do a great dutch baby, german apple pancake, and a dutch garden (dutch baby topped with veggies and cheese).  Their pancakes are my favorite- thin and flavorful, you can smell the buttermilk.  They come in every flavor, including seasonal pumpkin (amazing!) and fresh strawberry with whipped cream (during summer months, with fresh not canned whipped cream).  They also have classics like eggs benedict, corned beef hash, and amazing swedish pancakes (thin like crepes).  They also have a location in GVR that is newly expanded, for people on the Henderson side of town.

Hugo's is a Vegas landmark and an old school experience not to be missed.  Let me be perfectly clear that it is in the Four Queens Hotel, a dive hotel on the old strip with the parking lot to match.  That said, when you step down the stairs into Hugo's Cellar you are in an entirely different environment.  Ladie's are greeted with a rose and the setting is very romantic (dark wood walls, candlelight).  Service is excellent and they have some great sommeliers.  They have a very good wine list and serve complementary bottled water, as well as a nice bread basket with cheese-toasted lavash and rose-shaped butter.  Their salads are the highlite, included with your meal and freshly prepared on a cart at your table.  Toppings like hearts of palm and bay shrimp and delicious dressings- try the orange walnut vinaigrette.  You are served an intermezzo sorbet to cleanse the palatte (raspberry on a mini cone).  Dinner is very traditional- chicken, fish, and steaks served with a potato and vegetable.  Not especially gourmet or cutting edge, but very old school classic and part of the experience.  They offer traditional desserts such as bananas foster prepared tableside, and they bring a complementary dessert of chocolate covered strawberries, dried figs, and apricots served with whipped cream.  This restaurant is great and remeniscent of old Vegas, definitely a must try.

This place is super clean (major bonus points!) and they have great vegetarian pho.  I am mostly restaurant vegetarian and it's hard to find pho that is not either a beef or chicken broth.  Their's (I think called tofu/vegetable) is very flavorful, salty, and comes with a platter of very fresh veggies to arrange in your soup as you like.  My husband and I each get a large bowl- it is huge and takes forever to eat!  Their fresh spring rolls (the cold ones) are good, but not the best i've had.  The sweet sauce that comes with them is great.  Major bonus points for a place that offers a veg pho on par with the traditional beef one!

Glazier's is pretty middle of the road for me. Let me start off by saying that the store has a very strong, strange odor that has lingered since they first opened (my husband says its tolerable, I find it hard to bear). The layout is nice and the store looks impressive compared to most regular grocery stores (Smiths, Vons, etc). They have a large produce selection at very affordable prices. Lots of exotic fruit, vegetables, and peppers that cannot be found at conventional grocers. However, their herbs and most greens are less than fresh and their selection of organic produce is lacking (and way too expensive when compared to Trader Joes, Whole Foods, or even Vons). They have a great selection of ready made food, but few healthy options. Pizza, ice cream, sushi, pasta salads, pasta entrees, vegetable and starch sides, etc. Some of what I've tried has been good, including salmon stuffed with spinach and pesto, green beans almondine, mixed vegetable rice, broccoli with peppers, etc. They also have a nice looking coffee and tea bar and a good selection of gourmet bread (La Brea Bakery olive bread, jalapeno cheddar, pain rustic, organic whole grain, etc). They have a huge bakery with donuts, pastries, pies and cakes at shockingly low prices, but nothing even remotely health conscious. Salad bar is run of the mill and cant hold a candle to Whole Foods, but again the prices here are incredibly reasonable. They do have an organic/natural food section but they do not have organic eggs, meat, etc. 
I could not do my regular grocery shopping here, but this place is great for specialty items and anyone shopping on a budget. It is far better than a Walmart or Smart and Final and I like the fact that it's family owned. Their produce selection is worth a trip alone. I also find myself coming here when I get home late and don't want to cook- their ready made and pre-packaged food is available 'till they close at midnight. I wish they'd offer reusable bags, a discount card, and a juice bar among their ready made food stations. I also wish they'd refresh their magazines- I feel like I am in the twilight zone when I stand in line and see covers from weeks ago.

This place is fab... they have every single toy imaginable- from the typical pet store brands to more boutique style game/brain teaser toys (my dogs are currently obsessed w/ hide-a-squirrel!).  They also have food, treats, leashes, harnesses and more- all discounted.  Love this place.

This is one of the best places for boba tea in the city.  They have an extensive menu featuring the usual flavored black and green teas, slushes, snow ices, and smoothies.  Their prices are more reasonable than most tea houses in Chinatown, the service is friendly, and the place is clean as can be.  There are always people getting take-out drinks here and there are a couple tables inside and out front.  Favs include the strawberry milk tea and passion fruit black tea, both with boba.  My husband loves their fruit slushes.

Pet Pros is a nightmare, I cannot emphasize this enough.  Their dogs come from puppy mills, they were taken from their mothers far too soon and many dogs in the store have kennel cough and other illnesses due to improper care.  The staff, as expected, tell you the dogs came from reputable breeders and have papers, which means nothing and is standard in this industry.  This is where people go to purchase "designer dogs" for astronomic prices, without doing the research or investigating this industry.  A simple search on google will tell you all you need to know about petstores, puppy mills, and the store itself.  Go to petfinder.com and search for a rescue dog that fits your needs, or check out local animal shelters.  If you are looking for a specific hypoallergenic dog, check out breed-specific rescue organizations (ie. poodle rescue).  
Dont breed or buy while shelter pets die.

Tommy Bahamas is great.  I have eaten at their restaurants in Maui, Palm Desert, and here in Vegas- they are all consistently fabulous.  Service is always attentive and they have a great happy hour in the bar (there are also comfy booths if you dont want to sit at the actual bar).  Happy hour is I think from 4-7pm weekdays- discounted apps and drinks, and some really good fish tacos.  Their bread is in the shape of a crown, served hot with a sweet cinammon butter.  Great apps- favs include the coconut shrimp, cayman lollipops (chicken drumettes with mango bbq sauce), goat cheese with mango salsa and flatbread, and the ahi poke.  At lunch they have really nice salads and some great sandwiches, including a beer-battered crispy fish sandwich with tarter sauce and honey roasted onions.  For dinner, they have great seafood and a really great stuffed chicken (herb cheese and roasted red pepper cream).  Dessert here is a must, the pina colada cake is good but the butterscotch pudding is incredible.  Most desserts are available in small sizes, though they dont display this on the menu so you'll have to ask.  I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner on the patio on warm summer nights.

Tea Station is my favorite place for boba tea in Chinatown.  Their prices are definitely higher than most of the competition, but they do offer a discount on all to-go drinks.  And lets be real, some of the other tea houses in the area are just plain creepy.  The menu is extensive (over 10 pages of tea) and the atmosphere is nice.  This place is very clean- major bonus points, especially if you've frequented some of their local competition.  Tea Station is always packed, especially at night since they are open late.  My favs are their passion fruit green tea with boba, or the iced mixed fruit tea (although this one is super sweet).  My husband likes their fruit slushes.  This is a great place to get work done during the day (free wifi) or meet friends at night.  It is very popular for takeout drinks, in fact I always see 5-0 popping in here for their late night boba fix.  Service is reasonably friendly but definitely on the slow side, especially during busy times.  I would not recommend the food (their squid balls were inedible and smelled like a mixture of hot garbage and the ocean, though perhaps they are an acquired taste!).  I recommend this place based on their atmosphere, tea, and the fact that they are open late.  This is definitely more of a traditional tea house than your average take-out boba shop.

Layers is the best bakery in Vegas, without question.  This place is the closest thing Vegas has to a high quality bakery on par with SF or LA.  They use high quality ingredients and everything is always fresh, never sitting out more than that same day (like other lame bakeries in the area!).  Favs include their butter bars, cupcakes (flavors change daily), and sticky buns (get there early, these go super fast).  They also do beautiful celebration cakes to order (and have some avaiable in store every day).  I only wish they had more French pastries (almond croissants, napoleans, eclairs, brioche, etc).  That would bump them up to 5 star status!

Dupar's is all about the pancakes- go here for them, they're incredible.  Fluffy, drizzled with butter, & served up 24/7!  Solid breakfast here... bruleed oatmeal w/ fresh fruit, & eggs florentine among my favs.  They also have a great tuna melt, split pea soup, carved turkey sandwiches, pies, etc.  This is my go-to spot after a late night downtown, and for breakfast when I'm willing to make the trek down to Freemont.  Everyone I've taken here loves this place- they have an expansive menu and those pancakes are the absolute bomb!!  Best in Vegas, maybe even the best ever...

Vivido Gelato is good, but not authentic Italian gelato.  Large selection of flavors, but they're lacking some traditional staples (straciatella, fior de latte, etc) and need more fruit options.  Prices are high, especially given the small servings (two small gelatos for $8).  Also, they limit you to two flavor samples per person, which they announce when you walk in.  This just seems really cheap of them and totally rubbed me the wrong way.  There is something in their gelato that makes it very stretchy, almost gummy.  The mint was pretty good (but colored with green dye), blood orange was okay but not very flavorful.  I will probably go back if I crave gelato again, but only because there is nowhere else in the area.

This is the best dog store in Vegas.  The selection cannot be beat- they carry all the hollistic dry and wet foods, as well as treats.  Great selection of Wellness Formula, which is what I feed my dogs.  They also have a huge variety of toys, chews, clothes, beds, leashes, harnesses, bath products, etc.  They will special order anything you want that is not in-store.  Unfortunately I live clear across town from this store, or I would shop here far more often.  As far as pet stores in Vegas, this is as good as it gets.

Hedary's is legit Lebanese food.  Really yummy mango juice (more like a nectar and not overly sweet).  Solid hummus, good tabouli and Greek salads, and an incredible lentil soup.  Falafel are flavorful and not overly fried, although the sandwich was a bit on the dry side (needed more veggies/sauce to balance out the grittiness of the falafel balls).  Pita bread alone is worth the visit here- sweet, puffy, and served hot out of the oven.  I definitely want to come back for their lunch specials, and to try the shrimp scampi (ordered by the table next to us- smelled and looked amazing!).  Hummus, pita & that lentil soup are better here than anywhere else in the valley.

This is THE premier alpaca store in the valley, if you're into this sort of thing.  I happen to love various furs- from Mongolian Lamb, to sheepskin, to alpaca- and this store is a fur heaven!!  I take trips out here with friends when we want to update or add to our collections.  I love that no animals are killed for this fur, and the quality is exceptional.  They have fab pillows, rugs, and various accents for the home- as well as some pretty cute sweaters.  I've also gotten some handmade moccasins and a horseshoe hook here, designed by a local artist in Boulder City.  Prices are on the high side (which is typical for alpaca), but the men that work here (owners, I'm guessing) have been accommodating at lowering the price (especially when you buy several items).  If you're looking for Alpaca, this is the place to go!

I'm a fan of Rachel's.  Like another yelper said- Vegas needs way more places like this!  It's a gourmet little breakfast and lunch spot, you order at the counter and there are some cute tables in and outside.  They have breakfast burritos, pancakes, sandwiches, wraps, burgers (beef, chicken), soups, pastas, and huge salads (spinach, curry chicken, cobb).  There is a nice selection of veg options and everything is fresh and high quality.  Pastries could be much improved on and I wish they served breakfast past 11 on weekends.  Mad props for having fresh brewed tropical unsweetened iced tea.

Earl of sandwich is a great concept and the menu is super enticing.  Prices are fair, quality is average.  The turkey is in the form of cold cuts (not roasted like Capriotti's) and mirrored the quality of a Quiznos or- worse yet- Subway.  The bread here is baked fresh to order and is fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside- yum.  The All American sandwich was okay, but again the quality of the turkey was off putting.  It had cranberry sauce, buttermilk ranch, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheddar.  The fellow reviewer who said this sandwich trumps the Bobbie must have had a few too many, I mean really.  The tuna melt, however, was great- very simple with just tuna salad and melted cheese, but delicious.  If you like tuna melts then this is the place for you (that might have been a 5-star sandwich!).  Potato salad was average and they have a selection of other salads and kettle chips.  There is also an assortment of baked goods, unfortunately the chocolate cupcake we tried was yellow cake mix with chocolate frosting (lame!).  The earl gray lemonade was refreshing and delicious, and I loved that it was something different.  Major props for having good vegetarian options (veggie sandwich with feta and peppers and a caprese).  I'd probably come back for the tuna melt and an earl gray lemonade, but I am shocked that this place has better ratings than the much superior Tom Colicchio brainchild Witchcraft (which uses vastly superior ingredients and has more exciting offerings).  Mad props that it's open 24 hours.

Sababa has moved up to five star status- strictly based on their falafel.  Let me be perfectly clear, I have never had anything else here.  However, this is the best falafel in Vegas- and I have tried many.  The falafel and hummus comes in a pita pocket filled with tahini, tomatoes, pickles, cabbage, cucumbers, and lettuce.  They have an incredible green parsley hot sauce (crazy hot!) and their falafel is moist all the way through (not dry in the center like many others).  The falafels are fried to order and the sandwich is made in front of you.  Still wish they had fresh brewed iced tea, but I usually get takeout anyway.  This place is Israeli owned and about as authentic as it gets.

I love Red Velvet Cafe, for their baked goods alone.  I have never eaten the food here, but have visited many times for tea and cake and often pick up their baked goods to bring home.  The owner's wife does all the baking herself, and it is clear that great care has gone into developing her recipes.  My favorite is the red velvet cake, which looks like a large cupcake and is topped with a deliciously sweet frosting and a whole strawberry.   They also do a delicious chocolate peanut butter cake, also in the shape of a large cupcake with a moist chocolate cake and rich peanut butter frosting.  The best part about these cakes is that they are under 200 calories, vegan, and free of any saturated or trans fats.  She does not use artificial sweeteners or make things that are low fat but still unhealthy- these cakes are all natural, preservative free, and taste delicious.  I highly recommend this place for their baked goods alone, and I look forward to trying their food.  The menu features sandwiches, pastas, salads, and an assortment of vegan meats and cheeses that are all made on site.

Went back to Fresh 52 today with the desperate hope that they'd expanded and added a few more vendors.  Unfortunately you can literally walk through the entire place in under 5 mins, so it's hardly worth the drive across town.  However, there are a couple places that will keep me coming back (at least on occasion).  The bread from Bon Breads is solid and they have lots of varieties (white chocolate batard, multigrain, pretzel rolls, ciabatta, etc).  Also the salsa and chutneys from Miguel's rock!  The salsas all have a great kick, and they have a mango one too.  They have jalapeno jellies and an amazing apricot jalapeno chutney that is super flavorful.  A couple places have come in since summer and a couple have gone out- there is still a decent sized produce stand but its strange that there was only the one vendor.  There is a face painting station, a dog store, and a booth that sells Scentsy.  There is also an organic, loose leaf tea stand and another with baked goods (although there were very few options).  There is a crepe stand too, but they were mostly dessert flavors rather than breakfast options.  I wish this place was 10 times the size it is, but it's still worth checking out and most of the vendors were solid.

This review is for the spa only.  It's a fab property that I've enjoyed coming to for years... unfortunately this place is pretty dead lately and the staff are not friendly.  My masseuses have all been good but nail techs not so much.  If they are struggling for clients they need to up the ante and make it a great experience worth the drive.  Also, the pool was closed due to it being a weekday (so we couldn't use the full spa amenities, which is why we go).

Benjrong is a great neighborhood Thai place... my husband and I have been getting take-out from here on a weekly basis since they opened and have never been disappointed.  The service is excellent and the restaurant could not be cleaner or more pristine- the entire kitchen is on display (major bonus!).  Favs include their vegetable egg rolls (love that sweet, clear chili sauce), tom yum soup, pad see ew, pineapple fried rice, pad thai, and the currys.  Their hot sauce is great, so are the lunch specials.  The food does not compare to L.O.S. or Komol in terms of the flavor or complexity, but everything I've had has always been fresh and delicious.  I definitely recommend this spot- it is way above average for a local Thai place and is not filthy, dingy, poor quality, or lacking flavor- like so many other local places...!

Five stars for the falafel at Amena!  Similar in style to the falafel in pita at Sababa (hummus, cabbage, pickles, tomatoes, etc), but even better.  Their pita is fluffy & delicious, like soft little pillows.  Falafel are bright green, flavorful, and the perfect size.  You order at the counter and when it's ready, you come up and chose what veggies you want inside.  They also have a good homemade hot sauce on the tables, and a great selection of bakery items including a really great baklava.  Best falafel in pita I've had in Vegas.  I wish I'd tried this place sooner... the creepy Trader Joe's strip mall/dive-y location was throwing me off.  I should have trusted Misty's review because I've been missing out!  And like she said- they sell their pita bread!!

Familia is in a strip mall on Durango and delivers to the surrounding area super fast.  Good service & they always get your order right.  Love their garlic knots, greek salad, and pizzas (cheese w/ ricotta & basil is our standby).  They also have calzones and stromboli.  Good cannolis- thick cream with cinnamon and chocolate chips, filled to order in their homemade shells.  Spumoni ice cream for sale by the tub.  Way better than Marcos or some of the other chains in the vicinity!

Love this sushi spot, I've been coming here for the past few years.  They're in Town Square across the street from H&M, next to Yogurtland.  Atmosphere is warm and trendy and is why I often prefer Kabuki to other places in the area.  Comfy private booths, tables, sushi bar, and an outdoor patio.  Usually crowded from happy hour (great specials) to closing, but I've never had to wait more than 10-15 mins.  Extensive cocktail menu, decent wine selection and several flavored non-alcoholic drinks including sweet mango iced tea and mint lemonade.  Edamame comes with all sushi orders.  Good miso soup and house salad with ginger dressing, decent seaweed salad but not my fav.  Lots of apps, including fried eggplant and calamari.  Large selection of specialty sushi rolls, fav is the Lotus on Fire roll (spicy tuna, jalapeno and lotus root on california rolls).  Extensive menu with lots of pictures, and lots of non-sushi items including teriyaki, noodle dishes, soups, seafood, etc.  Fresh fish, great service & atmosphere!

Settebello is definitely the best Italian pizza i've had outside of Italy.  Their crust is bubbly, chewy and delicious.  They have some nice salads and a yummy focaccia (this is really just their pizza crust baked with some oregano and sea salt, but delicious none the less).  Great sangria, coctails, and espresso.  Unfortunately, their iced and hot teas are lipton (lame!!).  The margherita pizza is delicious, as is the four cheese (with gorgonzola and ricotta, yum!).  Their cannolis are good, traditional with dried fruit and chocolate chips but the shells and cream were both a little thick.  Their gelato is also good, but very airy and not dense like traditional gelato (great flavors though, including a seasonal apricot).  Comfortable atmosphere with tables and booths (props) and well worth the drive across town.  Five stars based on their pizza alone- delicious!

5 stars for the chai latte at Tipsy- best chai I've found in Vegas.  Spicy and not overly sweet, and major bonus points for being able to order it with almond or soy milk.  The chocolates here are also great- the s'mores bar is graham cracker-y, peanut buttery amazingness.  Definitely a spot worth checking out.

Lucilles is really great BBQ, definitely the best in Vegas by far. They're located in The District in GVR and the atmosphere is really great, very southern. Expect an insane wait here on weekends, but it's well worth it. They have some of the best sweet tea I've had, served in a huge maison jar. The bread basket is stuffed with buttermilk biscuits and apple butter, and they have some really good apps like pulled chicken sliders on sweet rolls, fried green tomatoes with red pepper cream, and fried pickles (spears, not chips served with remoulade). They have delicious salads (one with sauteed shrimp, one with smoked salmon and a peach vinaigrette, one with BBQ chicken and onion strings). They have the usual meat platters with brisket, tri tip, ribs, chicken, etc. They have a good blackened catfish and some incredible sandwiches- my favorite is the BBQ chicken sandwich with melted cheddar, onion straws, and lots of field greens on a french roll (they also have yummy potato buns). Sides are awesome- good mac n cheese, peanut slaw, sweet potato fries, cheese grits, etc.  Mad props for being one of the few BBQ joints that also caters to vegetarians- veggie burger, salad, or a really good marinated portobello sandwich with melted cheese and garlic mayo. Desserts include fruit cobbler, pecan pie, peach bread pudding, banana pudding, and red velvet cake !! There is a separate take out area near the entrance that absolutely kills it. Service is great and prices are reasonable, especially given the huge portions and quality. This is the only place my husband and I go when we crave BBQ, and we often take out of town guests here for the great atmosphere and food.

I bought my car here late last year and have had good experiences with both their sales and service staff.  They are knowledgeable about all the models (including mine, which was new for 2010) and they do not leave harassing messages or turn into stalkers if you need some time to think before making your lease/ purchase.  They always loan me a Lexus rental during servicing, even if I did not reserve one in advance.  The waiting room here is about as nice as one could be- flat screen, comfy couches, drinks, bagels/cookies (my husband creeps on their cookies like they're going out of style).  Thorough car wash (inside and out) with every service.  When an update was needed for my car's computer system, they came to my house and installed it.  Unfortunately they are the only Lexus dealer in the entire Valley, so they aren't exactly wheelin & dealin here.  I hear they are opening another location in the Henderson area, which i'm sure will be a huge plus for people on the other side of town.

The Molto Vegas Farmer's Market is one of my favorite things to do in this city.  This is an indoor famer's market, located on Dean Martin in a warehouse.  It runs on Thursdays from 11am-1pm, with a previewing for chefs at 10am.  I found out about this place by eating at one of Batali's restaurants- it's all through word of mouth, they dont advertise.  There is lots of fresh produce including some nice heirloom tomatoes, herbs, lettuce, interesting citrus, etc. though it is not all organic.  Their prices are high, as to be expected.  They do not carry dairy for sale to the public, aside from cheeses sometimes (goat, gouda, and a heavenly buratta that sells out immediately).  You have to be a member of their profit sharing group to purchase the eggs.  There are a couple other vendors that sell coffee, dates, and some hydroponicly grown herbs.  This market is very small and even mediocre compared to what you would find in California or Seattle, but it is much better than the other farmer's markets here in Vegas.  Be sure to bring your reusable bag!

Went there for my Husbands birthday on 12/16 and the food was not as good as the first time we went in January 2014.  The soup was cold, the shitake mushroon side taste like soy sauced mushrooms and the American cap was flavorful but was tough. 5 star is for the American Kobe, mac and cheese and the French Press coffee (Yumo).  We really like the service and hope the next time we go to Vegas, the food will be as good as the first time.

We stopped by for Pho since we were soo done with the Vegas mass grazing from last night.  The Pho here is decent as far as Vegas goes and the broth doesn't taste artificially sweet like some places when they load the MSG in there. Their bean sprouts are super clean and white which is a good indication they do it right. We may come back again if we have a Pho craving while in Vegas. Oh don't order the Che Ba Mau dessert it is a rip off!

The Roast Pork was crispy and is better than Sam Woo. The BBQ pork noodle was okay because the BBQ pork wasn't great. The food is definitely made for Asian taste and thus authentic.  If you like sweet and sour then this ain't the place(try Panda Express). Portions are huge so be ready to share:-)

I am from LA where there are many Sam Woos and this one's got to be the worst. You would think being the only one in Vegas it would do a better job at living up to the name like its LA restaurants instead they take a monopoly attitude. Food is mediocre and portions half of the same order in LA places. We tried the Roast Duck and you can tell it wasn't done thoroughly trhough and the meat didn't marinate through long enough. We also tried the clam and Ginger scallions. Clams were not fresh and the sauce had too much corn starch that it was thick and startchy:(
Also don't ask for forks or spoons as they still had clumps of someone elses dinner still stuck on them!!!stay with the disposable bamboo chopsticks!!

AVOID. The worst customer service I have experienced in Las Vegas. Extremely hard to cancel account. I was told my account was closed and current then was still billed after I moved when they claimed I still have bottles that were not dropped off. Long wait times for customer support. If there are other options, use them! Trust me, you are better off getting a faucet water filter.

The reasons I choose this place over Chipotle: Wheat Tortilla, Brown Rice option, pesto cilantro sauce, no charge for guacamole on items. I go here probably 2 times a week lately because it is a good option for a healthy meal. I usually get the salad with brown rice, black beans, chicken, pesto sauce and salsa. I also like the option for a wheat tortilla. Guacamole is fresh and has always been good. Great food, great healthy options, good service.

I was a customer for 6 years. Always paid my bill on time. I go to cancel my account (a month before I move) and I was told to bring all bottles and dispenser in before March 1st. I returned all bottles and dispenser on Feb. 23rd. I was given a receipt that said my account was closed and current. Today I get a bill for $30 and they say I have 5 bottles to return still!? Are you kidding me? You looked at my account on Feb. 23 and cleared it! Took 30mins on hold to get customer service and was just told that she sent an email and a response would take 3 days. If THEY determine I somehow have these mystery bottles of water that I never received I will not be refunded. AVOID THIS SERVICE! TRUST ME. Everything about closing the account was (and still is) a nightmare. Do yourself a favor and do business with someone else! Some of the WORST customer service I have seen in Las Vegas to date. Shame of businesses that know they are below standards and continue to operate without making changes to provide better service. I hope all the negative reviews catch up to you and you see a decline in your profits because I am guessing that is the only way you will fix the issues.

Let me preface this review by stating some facts. I lived here for 6 years. We ALWAYS paid rent on time, were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants. These apartments were great..... 5 years ago. What happened? If you are debating renting here, let me fill you in on what you are really in for. 

2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners. That was the downfall. Instead of taking care of upgrading appliances, upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests; they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal. They chose to close down the main pool.... right before summer. The pool was closed for months. They offered no reimbursement whatsoever. When you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments. The mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot. Car patrolled security (non-armed) that once existed, must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye. Apartment building security lights were left burned out even after MANY maintenance requests, which was CLEARLY a security issue. This last December, there was an armed robbery.... AT THE MAILBOX at 10pm! Two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant. We no longer felt safe and it was (in my opinion) because of poor management with caring about the safety and well-being of it's tenants that were already moved in.

Once you're in, why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety? You signed a lease and they know they have you locked in. In the last 2 years, our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times! The first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error (as stated by the maintenance man) and was repaired VERY poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldn't use our main bathroom. The third time (see video and pictures) was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced. The managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years. They also NEVER came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars, as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled. The foundation for the apartment is shifting as well. There were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what. Our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the building's unrepaired structure (multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this. Nothing was fixed, just noted on our maintenance record) 

Sounds great, right? There's more. So you can see how unprofessional they are, but how about unethical? They started bribing tenants to put in "5 star" reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for iPods and other prizes. They also, recently, started asking new tenants to put in "5 star" reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs. If you ran a sound business with great satisfaction, you wouldn't need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews, would you? Shame on any business that does this. And last, but not least, we are (at the time of writing this review 4/15/16) still waiting for our security deposit. Like I said, we ALWAYS paid rent on time, for 6 years! And the one time we are LEGALLY due our deposit IN FULL within 30 DAYS of moving out (Nevada States Law NRS 118A.242), it has not arrived. We have called Jessi, the manager, multiple times and never received a call back from her. We received one email stating the refund has been "processed" but still no update on the status or postage date.They tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what? You are a business! Act like it. Don't make excuses, just fix issues. If I were to tell them 2 years ago that I had some personal problems and couldn't pay rent (which never happened, just example given) would they let me pay late or maybe within 7-10 business days? NO! They would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didn't receive payment. These are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there. It is not right that businesses don't care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked. We should have moved out 2 years ago, that was our fault for staying so long. But we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff, 24hr armed security car patrol, maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day... all for the same price we paid there! Do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself. I can tell you that we feel like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free. Good Riddance, Vintage at the Lakes. And no, you can't buy a 5 star review from me.

Cool little breakfast spot. Staff was really great. Nice atmosphere and country decor. We had the red velvet pancakes and the Monte Cristo. They were INSANELY good. If you aren't watching the calories go and try these. They also have a good selection of items for you if you are eating very healthy too, as I look forward to heading back there and trying the lighter options as well. A+

LOVE this place, and here's why......
- GREAT, friendly and fast service. There are always 3-4 people coming by your table and refilling water/soda/beer/chips/salsa/bean dip! They are on top of it!
- Fresh tasting food. A lot of Mexican food around town (and elsewhere for that matter) taste like it's been sitting around for hours waiting to be served. This almost always seems fresh.
- Fair prices! The prices for items and combos are great! Great happy hour too.

I recommend the rancho style tacos and (of course) the fajitas!

I hope people support this place and keep it in town. This is a hard location for businesses to prosper it seems. SUPPORT GOOD BUSINESSES!

My girlfriend and I have ordered from Ninja Fit Meals about 5 times now. It is great! All of the meals we have had so far are really good, some we just like over others. They have taken my customization and substitutions to the meals and nailed it every time! They care about pleasing the customer and helping you stay on track with specific needs. The delivery driver always calls and/or texts to tell you he is on the way, which is nice. If you aren't home you can leave a cooler our with ice blocks and they will put the meals in there. We love the carb-less chow mein, turkey burger, turkey meatballs with spaghetti squash. All in all for meal prep and customer service, they are doing a great job! Thank you. - Cody

HORRIBLE!

We got a late night dinner there and everything was horrible. First, it looked like it was closed. I am sure that the employees do this so people just drive away (I wish we did). Our order was wrong. Cold and super greasy fries. 

and the chicken sandwich was RAW! If you think it's a pain to cook chicken late at night because it takes awhile SAY YOU ARE ALL OUT! But never rush it.

This place needs to either be under new management or torn down. Start over with a place that gives a damn.

I have been only volunteering at Toys 4 Smiles for a few weeks now but I can definitely say this is a great group of individuals that are donating a lot of time and energy to do something simple yet profound, make children happy. In a society full of high-speed entertainment (internet, cell phones and video games) fueled by a "I want it yesterday" mentality, it is refreshing to see something like Toys 4 Smiles. These toys are very simple, yet very high quality. It is rare in this day and age that a child will receive a toy that not only was HANDMADE for them but also requires them to use their imaginations. The way I think of it is that maybe some of these kids getting theses toys don't have a lot of people in their lives that make them seem "worth it." Well, I am hoping that some of these kids will get these toys and understand that a stranger took the time to make them by hand and that a stranger CARES. They are worthy of it and deserve it. It's a simple thing but if that message reaches some children that message could possibly affect a life. 

I encourage anyone looking to donate some time (doesn't matter how much) to give them a call and head on in and help make some toys!

The hidden gem in Summerlin! 

This is a little restaurant (separated from the gaming side) hidden by the Lake in Summerlin. We didn't expect much from this place but after reading the great reviews and it being so close to our home we had to try it.

IT WAS GREAT. Here's why......
- Friendly staff! Always smiling and it's a relief to see people working in F&B in Las Vegas that look like they are genuinely happy.
- The food. I'm sorry to say but I didn't expect great food. I was mistaken. Everything we tried was pretty dang good. The breakfast burrito was great. The club sandwich was huge and great tasting. The quesadilla was maybe my favorite I've ever had, with the peppers inside, the crema on top and it wasn't greasy at all. Corn beef hash was also good. The eggs and bacon may be the downfall for them. They seem like they are instant and the bacon was majorly overcooked. Looking forward to trying the chicken pot pie and some other things there!
- Price. It is VERY fair.

This place feels like a little local spot back home for us. So for that and the other reasons I listed, we will be coming back...... a lot. =)

I am somewhat new to comics. I read some as a kid but really just started getting into them more as an adult. 

I have been in some comic book shops where it feels like being a newbie is a bad thing and they don't really want you there. THIS ISN'T THAT TYPE OF PLACE!

The staff is great! They answer all my questions without some weird superiority judgment. (they also remembered me by name after only a few visits) They set up a subscription box for me to keep track of the comics I want. They matched some prices I found online for some back issues I needed. They call around to other stores to track down the issues you may need. They have a decent rewards card that when you fill it up you get a free book. The toys there are pretty fairly priced as well.

Overall, great place!

I recently planned my birthday party here complete with trying the "MONSTER PIZZA CHALLENGE" I have to say from the time I called to ask about having my party there to the time we left that night the staff there was awesome! It's so rare to find genuinely friendly staff in Las Vegas. They had our reservation perfect and gave my party it's own side of the restaurant. There was games for the kids. The pizza was very good. Roberto is a great manager (owner?) and he accommodated us with every need we had, which included staying open a little late. Do yourself a favor and go and support a Las Vegas business that deserves your money, time and appetite. 

ps - all you other Las Vegas business owners, Go to Graziano's Pizza and take note of how to treat customers right.

LOVE THIS PLACE!

Basically, this is chipotle/subway of pizza. Great and fair prices. Quality ingredients. Daily specials. Friendly staff. Beer.

Great concept. This place really does things right! The white pizza was great, as well as the classic margherita pizza.

The downside I think for this place is the..... NAME. It's hard to associate "custom built" with pizza, especially if you are driving down the street and can't see the "pizza" part written very small. To me, this seems like a great name for a cabinet maker or something.

We love this place and hope it survives the rough Las Vegas restaurant market but it doesn't ever seem that busy and I think the name is what's hurting it.  

What helps this place? Word of mouth and Yelp reviews!

We came here on a Friday around 5:00. I was a little nervous because of the other reviews but all in all it was a great experience. It's not like I was expecting much for 4.99. We have 3 kids and since kids under 4 eat free we fed our family for under $20! The pizza was fresh and hot and they kept different varieties coming out all the time. The tables were clean as were the bathrooms. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would absolutely go back to this location.

We chose Vanna to take care of our mature Golden Retriever Cody many times over 7 years ending when Cody passed in early 2016.  Vanna demonstrated such care and love for Cody and we were comforted when we were away knowing he was in the best care.  Vanna has a knack for taking care of multiple dogs at a time, and Cody always had so much fun with her and the other dogs.  She walked her guest dogs many times a day and Cody got more exercise and play than he did with us.  When we returned Cody was always so happy and healthy and he looked like he'd just had a dream 'dogcation'.  Cody would always get excited when we walked towards her place, it was clear he really enjoyed his time with Vanna and her other guest dogs.  Vanna's rates were the lowest in the area too.  If you want your dog get the best exercise, food, love and attention, and a chance to live and play with other dogs (they are pack animals), I very highly recommend Vanna's services.  Cody had a much improved quality of life because of Vanna.

First of all, these are amazing cupcakes! A little slice of heaven. Really the best cupcakes I have ever had -and I have had a few:). Secondly, the people that work here are super friendly and responsive.  We had a window for delivery time but when I called to see when they were coming within the timeframe (because we had plans), they changed their delivery route to come to our hotel and worked around our schedule. And they were so gracious about it. The delivery person wouldn't even take a tip.  Class act all the way around.

Saturday night a super busy place. The atmosphere is definitely lively. The food was ok I ordered the meatloaf  it came with soggy and greasy onion rings... left them untouched. My partner ordered the pub hamburger with a side of crunchy onion rings... onion rings soggy and limp.  Not a place to recommend.

This was probably the best seafood meal I have ever had! And in Pittsburgh!! Who knew? 2 locals on the strip recommended this restaurant when I asked where we should eat atop Mount Washington. They both stated Monterey Bay Fish Grotto. 
The drinks were excellent, as was the ambiance. The view was amazing and we weren't even by the window, but elevated to where we could see everything. Incredible! The appetizer was to die for, and the meal itself was superb! I had the parmesan crusted swordfish, my husband had the crabcake with sea scallops, and our daughter had the crabcakes. All were cooked to perfection and plated beautifully. Our server knew what she was talking about and was very helpful in our selections. For dessert, we shared creme brulee and the angel food grilled cheese. Oh my word, talk about delicious! If you don't eat anywhere else in Pittsburgh, this is THE place to try!

First I stay at the Grand every year for CES last year was really nice but this time I am very disappointed with the room and the cleaning crew. When I got to my clean room I was great by the housing keeping. They had just cleaned my room min before I got in. I decided to use the rest room to wash up before hitting g the strip and noticed that the bathroom was clean but on spot. The shower wall had black long women's hair on the wall. I called the front desk to get house keep up to clean it. They did cone and cleaned the rest room, but fit some reason they did not clean the wall were the hair was. I had to call three times before someone would c lean it. 

Not very happy with my stay and it's only the first night

My family and I travelled to Montreal for a week, after reading a couple reviews we decided to grab some dinner at this location. We arrived around 5 PM, and it was not busy. We were not greeted or seated for a good 5-10 minutes after walking into the door. The waiter did not seem to know much about the menu or he did not bother to explain any of it to us, we ordered some appetizers. Most of the food was bland with no flavor. Their spring rolls are not authentic spring rolls, most likely spring rolls catered for non-asian. Let's see, it took about 10 minutes to get seated and the appetizers came out 15 minutes after we ordered, but after finishing out appetizers and waiting approximately 20-30 minutes after our mains had still not arrived. So we asked the waiter how much longer our main courses would take, he looks at us then looks down at his hand which had our orders. He did not put the orders through! This was horrible service and he did not even apologize, he would looked annoyed anytime he looked at our table. Keep in mind that when we walked in there was only 2 occupied tables. It was already getting late and we decided to wait for the main course. The pho had the weakest broth I have ever tasted. Everyone else food was either cold or bland. HORRIBLE food and TERRIBLE service.

If you're a tourist, COME HERE! The service was nothing short than superb, came to Montreal to visit some friends and explore the city, we had a reservation and we greeted kindly as soon as we walked in. Our waiter was friendly and lively, more importantly patient as we had difficult time choosing what to have. We ended up getting quite of bit of food to share among all of us. The food was terrific, the beef tartar was packed with flavor and ask for extra bruschetta because there is only 3 pieces along with the order. Duck poutine and shepherds pie makes my mouth water every time I think about it. Their wine selection was not bad, and had all of the essentials. We had a great time among friends and the staff, and the food with wine is amazing!

Matt is the hardest working and most dedicated worker I have ever met. Every previous worker I have used to clean my dryer vent took the easy route and did a half quality job. Matt squeezed into areas my two year old boy would have trouble getting into just to make sure the job was done correctly, and on top of this is half the price of every other company I called. At the end of the job he told me that he probably saved another dryer fire from occurring and that makes it all worth it. Truly loves his work. I will never call another company again.

So far so good! Service Has been awesome, Beer has been great! The carne asada quesadilla was yummy! The margarita pizza was excellent and the buffalo chicken slider was tasty. I was not impressed with the black angus and pulled pork sliders. The pulled pork turned out to be carne asada and not pork at all, and the angus was only a burger patty. Didn't come with toppings it sauces. Otherwise excellent!

Worst green curry I have ever had. The chicken and vegetables in the curry were good and fresh but the actual curry a
Sauce was awful!!! It said it was made with coconut milk, but I'm thinking more like coconut water, or maybe just plain water. It was runny and flavorless! But the spring roll that came with the lunch was good....

Great pizza, friendly staff. First time trying neechis pizza. As a active duty military member pizza is almost part of my everyday diet. I was very impressed with the taste and the amount of toppings the crust had good texture and was very tasty as well but the sause is what made me put them at the top of my list very unique  I haven't come across before in other pizza shops that I've been at across the country  (San Diego, Texas, north chicago,michigan,ohio) I travel alot so I like to get a taste of everyones pizza. And they offered me me a military discount which helps us military guys out thank you neechies.

HORRIBLE SERVICE! Waited for a half hour didn't get our appetizer, while everyone who was seated after us was served.  The server didn't even get our order until 15-20 mins of being seated. I get its a new restaurant but it shouldn't take that long for our appetizer to get to the table. The manager had to go to the kitchen and get our food that was probably just sitting there. Then when we got our food the waitress came over and said she forgot our onion rings. So upset with the dining experience. Food was alright but still didn't need to take over an hour to get everything to our table. Thought this was a burger place?

This was an excellent restaurant with a great ambience and lovely food. I was in town looking for a great place to eat which would serve fresh food with high quality in reasonable portions, and I stumbled upon this place. The service was great, the food was excellent quality and taste and minimal disruptions. I ordered the kale and arugula salad which I did not realize had bacon on it. The server did not even question my concern and right away replaced the salad for my convenience and satisfaction. I was so impressed at how she did not even question it and said no problem we will just change the for you to make sure you are happy with your food choice. I would really recommend this place

Service and atmosphere was really great and had a fun twist on decor. Food came out quickly and the portion size was large. Got the la vaca loca that had the steak. Flavoring was great, but ordered with the green sauce and I didn't really taste or see it in the burrito so maybe it was forgotten? So instead I loaded it with the side of salsa given and side of guacamole that I ordered and omg so good! Salsa and guac was awesome and so fresh. Definitely will be going back for a nice quick lunch

This place is absolutely amazing and service outstanding! The atmosphere is relaxing with stunning views which makes this place one I keep coming back to again and again. Prices are completely reasonable and I believe a little cheaper when compared to the other high end spas in the area. The restorative organic massage is my favorite since it uses hot towels to massage your back and includes a scalp massage and foot scrub!

Of course the food and drinks were perfect like always! Cocktails are a must and you can't go wrong with any one (especially their Mai Tai). We always do a full meal of appetizer, entree (the snapper, steak salad, or fish tacos are my favorites) and dessert when we go because everything is just so good! Hands down my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale area; you just can't pass up a beach paradise atmosphere in the desert.

After shopping around for cushion replacement not only did I get the best price and customer service here, but Valerie even came to my home at no additional charge to measure everything. She even offered to discard the old ones for me & if they're in good enough condition they donate them to dog shelters to be used as beds which is such an amazing idea! They had the best selection of fabrics from different manufactures including Sunbrella, Tommy Bahama, Outdura, and Pindler. Valerie was also really helpful to narrow down choices that helped me stay in budget, but as she mentioned you can start here and the sky's the limit!

I had such high high hopes for this place. Truly. I too toured the facility and I like Marc T was in awe of the facility and the cleanliness everything was so new and properly stored, I felt like if I had to put my baby somewhere this is what I would want.  I did in fact enroll my child for the summer program the rates are high but I figured someone has to pay for the amazing aquarium that was mentioned in the previous review and it included snacks and 'breakfast & lunch' so I dove in!! 

With MUCH push my husband finally agreed to let me pay the fees which included a enrollment fee of 150 plus the first week, (you are charged weekly on Fridays) I chose to put my child on an easy-pay system where they would pull out weekly for his tuition Mistake 1. The first week they charged us our normal tuition plus enrollment fee (183 for 3 days mon, wed, fri & 150 enrollment) then no less than 3 days later they charged us again! This being our first week my husband and I were a little taken aback but we figured eh maybe a fluke,  after addressing the issue with  Kaylee we were told "no worries, well note your account and we just wont charge you for next week" great I thought lets move forward then 3 days later ANOTHER charge now I was getting a little annoyed.

I don't know your financial situation but the tuition is high so these accidental charges were starting to hurt after the 3rd accidental charge. Again I went to the office and spoke with Angela the finance director and I told her we were a little concerned we had only been attending one week and already had been charged for 3 weeks plus enrollment. I kindly asked for a refund as I didn't mind waiting for the first accidental charge to catch up, I was more than a little peeved about the other charges. I talked to Selena and she told me that I needed to bring in my credit card statement that showed the charges...Lol I wasn't lying. Don't they keep records of what they are charging peoples cards!!
Angela tells me SUUUUURE you can have a refund in 6-8 weeks!!!! 6-8 weeks because your finance department cant keep its records straight? I snatched up my easy pay document so fast she had a paper cut!!! 

So I let it go AGAIN (really didn't have a choice we were 3 weeks in on charges) I continued to bring my son. When I would pick up my son the room was so hot I could smell the children's sweat but this is AZ heat so I figured man the AC must be working hard to keep this place cool and I would bring him at 8 so maybe they had just turned it on. 
One of my biggest concerns was the child to teacher ratio, were talking 15 KIDS TO EVERY ONE TEACHER!!!! Why? because that's the minimum that the state will allow wouldn't you want your child to go to place that goes above a beyond the bare minimum? It was a ZOO when I would have to get him early. There was no less than 35 kids in the class at any given time. Great! I thought a great way for him to socialize with children his age. They called me less then 1 hour into his class saying that my son had attacked a little boy, when I went to get him thinking my son had mauled a little boy I was very upset he had never hit before, when I walked in he was sitting alone (I assume time out) which I am okay with but when I asked if the little boy was okay I looked he had a scratch the size of a sewing needle, not downplaying what my son did he should never hit but they are 5!!! They are learning they are going to get into scuffs.  My son came home on the 3rd day with a large scratch on his forehead I didn't say anything because I get it, they have scuffs and boys can be a little rough. After the 2nd time I chose to remove him from the program, just in time in my opinion I just got a letter saying they needed another 150  for supplies. Lol
Across the hall from my sons class was the infant room, my heart would break to see the infants crying with no one trying to console them. As a mother I know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they aren't required to have more teachers in the class?. It just made me so sad to see this daily.   

The staff is SUPER UNFRIENDLY I actually stopped smiling to them because you know that feeling when you smile at someone and they look a you like you have gone mad smiling at them!!

In conclusion if you feel the need to enroll you must be okay with the following:

1. Your child must NEVER make a mistake like get a little rough with another kid, if you work plan to miss a few days because you will be asked to come and get him

2. Have an endless supply of money because they will need it. 150 enrollment, 150 for 'supplies' ( must be for the starbucks) plus tuition 
3. must be okay with unfriendly staff drop your kid and leave. 
4.Must be able to figure out their plans they don't tell you crap till day of!

UPDATE: The school asked that I remove this post.....ugh I think not!!!!

I've been taking route 57 - Courtney Park for the past 6 years and it's been a disaster. This route operates only every half an hour during rush hours and even that is with lots of problems. 

- sometime one bus doesn't show up AT ALL
- there is never any action taken to accommodate for the problems on the route or with the bus breaks down 
- the bus stops, either in terminal or even enroute have no shelter and waiting so long in cold winters is not fun!

The service throughout the night was inconsistent.  I asked how the shrimp was prepared.  The server said, "medium, we prepare all of our fish medium." Uncooked shrimp? No thanks.  We ordered two appetizers, a salad, steaks, and a side dish.  The oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces.  The salad was good, tomatoes were fresh.  The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, "it will be out but I don't have a time to give you."  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, "yes, I thought that it didn't look right."  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, "I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check."  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.  Unfortunately, this restaurant was a big let down.

Needed a "Schedule B" service on my 2014 E350....knew the dealer would be expensive but would probably get the job done with minimal hassle.  More than pleasantly surprised with the quality and timeliness of the work.  But what compelled me to give a five star rating was the final bill.  When I picked up the car I was told I needed a new "pollen filter" and a new "air filter".  I was hoping it would be just an oil and oil filter change, but Carlos told me they needed to be changed.  I was shocked when he handed me the bill and it was at the estimated price. I asked about the filters, and he told me they were able to change them and honor the original estimated price.  This has never happened to me at a car service place ever.  Never ever.  I am a very satisfied customer.  They did the work at a fair price, and well under the dealer price.  Could not have asked for more.

Second trip to Frank's, and it is always a very good experience.  Frank is beyond fair, the work is top-notch, and both times the car was delivered on-time as promised.  They get my highest recommendation as getting your car repaired is not the most pleasant task in the world, but Frank makes it as painless as possible.  Everybody in the shop has a great attitude.

Great place right on the Capitol Square. Very good food and good beer selection. Pretty good prices as well. Expect to pay anywhere from $8-$10 for a sandwich/burger with side. Didn't end up having the fried cheese curds like other people recommend but they did look delicious!

Only gripes for this place are that you can expect to wait a while for a table and they do not take reservations. Second, when it gets busy the service can be slightly spotty and it seemed to take a while to get our food.

It's such a great place though that's probably why it's so busy!

Another great staple of Madison that is a must try. Food is very good and beer is of course good. You can get free popcorn for the table. Order food and drinks at the bar and they bring it out to you.

Came here in the winter (January) and still had a lovely time! Walked around the outside areas where we were told the things to see included grasses and bark.....

Who doesn't love a conservatory in winter? Nice steamy walk through an area teeming with life! Great variety of plants and trees to see along with some birds (mostly quail). For some reason I'm a sucker for pitcher plants, for which there were a number for me to see around the conservatory. Would definitely like to come back in spring/summer.

This is a fun place in Madison to come hang out especially on Fridays or weekends. Was pretty packed this past Friday when I went and at first was kind of too much craziness. Luckily we had reserved seats and people seemed to settle down after the first couple innings as lines for beer and food shortened considerably.

Love the beer that they have here. Lots of Great Dane brews and more common craft brews. Food is pretty good with burgers, brats, pulled pork, chicken, fries, slaw, potato salad all available.

Would recommend paying the $5 for the reserved seating in advance though the only drawback is that this is not like a picnic table so it is a bit hard to have a group there in reserved seats and all be comingling unless you are getting up a lot. Regardless, this is still a fun time and it shows by how packed it gets.

It is pricey for the average golfer but if you are an avid one who appreciates good golf courses and experiences, this is a great choice. Played the Desert and Canyon courses which were both in very good shape. Cool layouts with some challenges including some tight holes. Overall though this is a very beautiful course on SE side of Camelback Mountain. 

Only criticism is that we got out early on the Desert course and played pretty quickly only to get stuck behind a whole bunch of groups at the turn going to the Canyon course. The ranger/time starter guys couldn't exactly explain why that happened.

Overall though this is a great course with nice amenities. Grass tees. GPS in cart. Would definitely come play again.

Course was in great shape and is reasonably priced for a TPC course. This is a fun course to play but is very tight! Great location right at the Marriott in Scottsdale and is convenient to get to from most places.

The people were friendly except for one guy in the pro shop. Interestingly the 18th hole is the only one where there were some quality issues as the fairway and green were not in as good of shape as the rest of the course.

All in all though, I would definitely return.

The only knock I have on this course is that it is a bit pricey (which is a common complain of mine). But overall this was a great course and a great experience.

We played in late December so there was a frost delay but once we got off it was sunny and not very cold. The group in front of us was playing a bit slow from the outset and by the third hole the ranger was on them to speed up (which they did).

Course is playable for many skill levels. My group played the tips and are above average golfers and we enjoyed our experience a lot. It was not an overly challenging course but still required skill. Very professionally run course with 3 separate nines (we played Ironhead and Acacia). 

Course was in good shape and greens rolled true. Only additional complaint would be that the restaurant was under construction and not open for another month or so and when we went to the only other shop which had food they were out of some different beers and other items (which they had on display and made it seem like they did have them available).

I would return.

Not much to complain about here. Good food on the east side of Madison with a good beer and drinks menu. I had the bison burger which was fantastic and got the side of cucumber cilantro quinoa. People I was with had skirt steak (again delicious) with garlic mashed potatoes (you guessed it....delicious). 

Very nice wait staff and good homey kind of place. If I lived in Madison I would definitely come back to this place as a staple.

This course is on the less expensive end of the scale for Scottsdale which still means fairly pricey (I believe it was around $80-$90 per person in prime season in end of March?). There is no driving range but we went to one of the courses nearby beforehand which wasn't very far away.

Overall though thought the course was pretty solid with a nice layout. Greens in good shape. Course had some challenges but also had an overall layout that seemed to keep the ball findable because everything sloped inward. Got out at 8:45 or so and played pretty quickly. Would definitely come back for more.

Found this place on Yelp while I was on vacation in Scottsdale so figured we would try it out and it was wonderful!

The service was great and there wasn't really anyone else there when we went so Arturo stopped by and offered us some of the Habanero Tequila (apparently he makes it). WOW it was hot. Not really for me but very interesting and awfully cool of him to come out and offer us some.

Food was great! I had three different tacos (Calimarii, Blackened Fish, and Carnitas) and all were awesome!. Other people in my party got blackened fish entree, the carnitas entree, the carne asada entree. Everyone was happy!

Friendly people and great food. Pricing was very reasonable too. My tacos were $2.50/$2.99 each and most entrees were in the $6-$9.50 range.

Would definitely return!

Cool distillery/bar east of Madison. Didn't really see a lot of the distillery but mainly there is a drinking room. They have a menu of different cocktails. Was there on a Saturday around 6 and it was fairly busy.

Pricing is pretty good - generally $6 per mixed drink. Try the Honey-Cap!

Always hard to judge how strenuous a hike is from reading reviews cause you don't know people's fitness levels. This will definitely present a challenge for people that don't exercise much as the first part is fairly steep and continues for probably about 30-45 minutes. We took the trail up to Tom's Thumb and back which took at least 2 hours round trip. We started early like some recommended to take advantage of shade on the first part of the trail at that time of day and it was a great idea. 

The trail itself though is very nice aesthetically with great views and an interesting path. The trail to Tom's Thumb is pretty well marked. The view from Tom's Thumb is great and you marvel at seeing the trailhead parking lot off in the distance, seeing where you started from.

Great Mexican place in downtown Madison just off State Street. This place strikes you as very authentic (perhaps it was something about the luchador fights on TV in the restaurant with the Spanish commentary).

Food was awesome. Had tostadas and gorditas which were both fantastic (chorizo, steak, pastor (pork) - can't go wrong!). You can buy individual tostadas or gorditas for $3.50/$3 each though there are lots more options. Also had this amazing drink that was like milk with cinnamon toast crunch flavoring. Definitely check that out.

Been to the Dane County Farmer's Market more times than I can count over the years. What an awesome event every Saturday. Atmosphere is wonderful. The market extends around all 4 sides of the Capitol. 

Highlights of the market are the wonderful fresh food, trying all the awesome cheese samples (curds, fried cheese, aged cheese, etc.). Doesn't get much better than the fried cheese. Great pastries/bakery items too - hot and spicy cheese break, donuts, muffins, scones, etc. I've also bought vegetable plants from the market and they've seemed to turn out better than ones you buy from home depot or somewhere like that.

Truly an awesome place. Lots of people though and if you get there after 10 it is pretty crazy busy. More like a crawl around the Capitol.

I'm always surprised at how hard it is to find good Pad Thai but this was always good. Service was usually good. I would do both sit down and carry out and had good experiences with both.

Saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and had to come try the brioche french toast. We went on a week day and it wasn't very crowded. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food that I was with (people got omelet, the Wolfpack (hash browns with eggs and bacon in between more hash browns) though noone thought it was outstanding.

The brioche french toast I had came with caramelized bananas and pecans and I had to ask for more bananas because I literally was brought 3-4 small slices of banana on top of my french toast and the pecans were all bits and pieces. To their credit, they brought me out a lot more bananas and they were caramelized and in the caramel sauce.

I would definitely return.

This place is nice but nothing outstanding. If you are looking for a place to go and get pampered this is not the place for you. The pool is nice and the hot tub is pretty large and awesome.  

The only restaurant on the premises is a small snack shop by the pool which has sandwiches and such. The rooms have kitchens which provide what you need if you want to make your own food while you are there. There is a breakfast provided from 8-8:45 two days a week which is nice but isn't out for long after the 8:45 end time. During that time you are presented different activities and excursion type stuff you can do in the area.

The concierge is definitely helpful as they recommended a good breakfast place (though there are others) and helped us get a tee time at a discounted rate at a nice course nearby.

Assuming you have a car, going to Sedona is a must and is a pretty drive up there. Also interesting if you are adventurous and are comfortable driving on unpaved roads in the mountains is driving the Apache Trail which goes out to Tonto National Forest and Roosevelt Lake.

I would likely go somewhere else if I went back to Scottsdale as I wasn't blown away by the place, but it depends what type of vacation you are looking for. The place was clean but the maid service didn't really do much.

Oh! This place is soooooo gooooooooood. Brunch buffet is absolutely ridiculous - prime rib on Sunday, every kind of breakfast food you can imagine, for a little extra you get all you can drink mimosas, cinnamon rolls are awesome.

For dinner I was a huge fan of the cheddar burger (you get a ton of shredded cheddar on top) and the prosciutto pizza. Beer was great too.

Service is typical. Decent prices. Food is fricking awesome.

This place rocks. Would come here very often if I still lived in Madison. Everything from the food, to the setup, to the décor is awesome. Not been to many places where you go to find more seating upstairs and it basically feels like you just got home. There are tables and then a whole loft-style area with couches and comfy chairs where people can hang out. But in an authentic way, not the forced Starbucks kind of way.

The food is stellar. Got the chorizo skillet which was amazing. My part also indulged in blueberry and raspberry scones which were awesome (taking cues from the other recommendations). I enjoyed a nice hazelnut coffee and then got the free refill! Also loved how you can take jars of preservatives/jam to your table to which were also delicious.

Went for the tour and drinking on a summer Saturday. Pretty nice little Saturday! Tour is $5 and they just take you through the warehouse and some of the brewing area. It isn't anything overly special. If you've been on other brewery tours before it is a pretty standard one.

Beer I great though. With the $5 tour you get a small tasting glass and three different tastings. They have the staples along with more seasonal and experimental type brews. Pretty reasonable prices too if you want beers/pitchers also (which you will). Pitchers are generally around $11.

So, after my walk from whalburger, which is in an earlier review, also amazing, we headed to the fuel bar.  Professional flaretenders.  Sooshey and the guys throw up a mean cocktail with some sick tricks to go with it.  I have been to places where flare was the theme but the drinks tasted like sweaty nut water, but here, the drinks were amaze balls!!! I suggest getting the Moscow mule, and try to find the bogo coupons they have floating around.

Got $1000 worth of tires today. They told me it would be a long wait & they'd call me when done. I waited from noon till 3pm. The tires were done @ 1:45 pm. They said they were too busy to call. 3hrs for the guy in front of me for a flat tire fix. When he complained Erick his service guy said "Thank you" with a smirk and walk away. Don't recommend them. The change in staff since the last few tire sets I purchased is quite noticeable. They need customer service training.

I was kind of hesitant when I seen that a Thrift Boutique was coming to the neighborhood. But when I chose to stop in; it was a pleasurable experience; very upper class. They have clothing (men, woman, children) some sporting, kitchen, baby items. Great condition, some prices could be lower, but over all not too bad.
I've been in twice; looking forward to going back to see what is new.

I recently moved to the area and was looking to get my oil changed on my vehicles. Walked in and spoke to Carlos.......he was very helpful and polite. Made an appointment for both my vehicles. Got everything I needed and was updated on when and how often I needed to do further maintenance. Carlos shared with me what type of oil to use, spark plugs ect...........NO one had ever done that before. I was actually treated like a person and not a female who didn't know anything. This was a GREAT experience; will highly recommend. Oh, and something else I didn't expect............I now have an online garage where I can keep track of my maintenance and they offer coupons too!

I thought maybe this was a hidden gem, not at all! Food was okay, space is very dank, service was horrible! My dinner counterpart did not like her meal, the waitress' response: Sorry. After asking the item to be removed from the bill the waitress and owner literally argued with us since she had taken a few bites (how else can you tell you do/don't like something). A few days later, I'm noticing they ran my debit card twice. NEVER AGAIN!

This place is true to its name. I agree with some of the other ratings I've read about the friendly staff, good machines, and comfortable environment. Only downfalls are that the WIFI doesn't always connect to my PC and that they don't do alterations w/ dry cleaning. I can def overlook those things, however. Oh, and I LOVE that the machines accept debit/credit cards: note that it'll automatically take about $15 dollars out though, then comp the difference afterwards.

Cheap prices but I'd rather pay full price for decent food.

Calamari was greas instead of crispy, served on a bed of tomato sauce rather than dipping sauce. 

Prime rib sliders tasted like the meat had spent the last week in the refrigerator before being served. 

Last was the tenderloin skewers , my wife ate them as I had lost my appetite...she said the best part was the sauteed spinach they were served on. Ya, they shoved a wooden skewer into 3 chunks of random shaped  over cooked salty meat.

Waitress was very nice and was sure to remind me how cheap the bill was, I guess so I would't stiff on the tip.

My beer was nice & cold ...I should have stopped there.

I should have checked the box before I got home. I ordered for pickup. I understand this is a pizza place but I paid over $10 for 5 burnt chicken fingers and 10 burnt fries. I LITERALLY counted 10 fries. How was that acceptable to serve on a plate as a cook and then as a cashier how could you let someone walk out with that? I was so hungry and too pissed to go back when I got home. Extremely disappointed with the sky pointe location.

Keith was my sales rep he was awesome. I had to take care of a busted iPhone 6plus screen and decided to just ditch the iPhone all together. I was totally prepared to turn the iPhone in and get the 80$ credit so I wouldn't have to deal with fixing it. Keith explained ALL of my options and I had a clear understanding of what I was getting. I switched from Verizon, WAS VERY IMPORTANT I KEEP MY NUMBER.. he transferred my  contacts(offered to transfer photos if needed), had the screen protector put on my phone. The best part is he did all of this in 20 MINUTES. 

Everyone at this store was extremely professional and friendly. Keith understood what I needed and I felt comfortable about making the switch from Verizon after 14 years!!! Nicholas and Robbi (sp?) were knowledgeable and professional as well.

Thanks again. I left the store feeling like I got exactly what I needed and was looking for.

 If you're looking for an EFFICIENT FAST professional you can trust, I would go to this location.

This was honestly the best time I've ever had getting my photo taken!

My last passport photo was taken at a Black's, and was so bad that customs agents actually laughed every time they saw it.

In comparison, I actually look so much better in this photo than I do in real life! John (the owner) absolutely adores what he does. From the second I walked in, he had nothing but compliments for me. He gives you the option to choose from multiple poses, and then takes the best one and does some slight Photoshop magic to make it even better. He then prints it while you wait.

Cash only - all in, it cost $7.90 for 2 passport photos with the official stamp, and he threw in an additional one "for my mom". 

Overall, it took 10 minutes for the whole "experience", but it also never felt rushed. I'm tempted to go back to get other random photos taken, just because he made me feel so good about myself! Be sure to ask him about the time he was in a movie with Mark Wahlberg - he has the photos to prove it!

We have visited this place multiple times over the past few years and when I found out they had a private room for me and my guests I was so excited! At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?

My BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email. I understand that she is the owner's wife but I've had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did. She was brash and offensive. Not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues. You can count on the fact that I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked; which is unfortunate because I work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations. I sure hope the lack of customer service turns people off from dining here, you are better off going to Cheesecake Factory!

While it's been nearly a year since I had a fabulous dinner at Michael Mina, I still think about the amazing meal I had.

It was my first trip to Las Vegas and my boyfriend wanted to impress. By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.

We were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.

Service was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or "over-styling." Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.

I'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.

It's worth the pennies to go, and try the chef's menu!

Carnevino is definitely a meat-lovers joy - but maybe a little over-priced for what you get.

My boyfriend is a carnivore and steak-addict, to the point where his friends recommended he come here.

We started with the Beef Tasting Menu, and while the crudo was well done, my issue was so many places seem to do a raw Kobe appetizer. Something a little more creative (with same meat!) would have been lovely. I will say I really loved the beef-cheek ravioli - I stole my boyfriends because I felt my portion needed to have more in it. Personally, the wet and dry aged beef were good and "beefy and meaty," but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak. I preferred the dry aged to the wet...the wet aged just seemed a little bland in comparison. 

We veered off course a bit - my boyfriend wanted MORE meat and we ordered the dry-aged bone in Rib-Eye for 2. I didn't eat much as my boyfriend devoured it, but the meat was flavorful for sure...just not my style. Ending with the tasting menu desert, which I can't remember because it was so generic. I think creativity could have been a lot better.

Service was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well. Our server was so excited we wanted more steak - but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill? The worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casino/hotel walkway. I prefer people not staring at me or my meals when I eat. 

Lastly, the price. While the cuts of meat were good, I just don't feel the costs justified what was done in the meal. The creativity was lacking and maybe it's because it's such a meat-BASED restaurant...but I feel like it could have been more creative. 

If you liked dry-aged steak and big, bold Italian reds, this is the place for your. But I prefer my steak to melt like butter in my mouth and this isn't the place for it. I will tell you my boyfriend enjoyed it far more than I did. Otherwise, maybe try another, more diverse restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian Restaurant row.

Amazing steak and other food, but be prepared for a slight bit of wallet shock.

I made reservations at CUT back in May while visiting LV, but due to an unfortunate bout of illness (DO NOT EAT DUCK FRIED RICE FROM THE BELLAGIO POKER ROOM)  that required hospitalization, I was forced to give my reservations to my friends. The next day, visiting me in the hospital, they raved about the quality of the steaks, being from overseas. I knew that next time I was in Las Vegas, I would need to go.

What luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a WSOP event, and we returned to Las Vegas and made another reservation at CUT for mid June.

We were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt. We knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and I have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward iPad wine list. She helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires. 

After ordering our wine, we got down to business. For appetizers, we had the Kobe sashimi and the Roasted Beets with goat cheese. They actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us. 

For our main courses, I chose the American Wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. I love Kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste I would expect for a $130 steak. My boyfriend chose the New York Sirloin tasting that consisted of the dry aged American sirloin, American Wagyu, and NZ Wagyu. He ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were THICK) and they were epic. Just meaty and buttery at the same time. My steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven. 

For sides, we had the mac & cheese, and spring peas with bacon. To be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony! 

After some excessive meat consumption, I saw a souffle float by to another table. I had to dig deep down, but I never regretted the chocolate souffle. It was rich but airy at the same time. I didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best I've had. The small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.

The service was extremely attentive and water refills/bread requests came quickly and discretely. (Yes, the bread was that good too). My one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. The overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like I was in an HGTV show instead of a restaurant.  When I think steakhouse, I think a little more comfortable and a little less "sleek." That said, I also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, I like to eat my food without blinding. If you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.

Overall, I recommend CUT if you have money to splurge but you'll be sure to enjoy your meal.

Great hotel with fabulous services and restaurant - just what Phoenix needs!

We stayed here for a few days after trying to find a place to stay in Phoenix that WASN'T a chain or a massive resort for a decent price and were very pleased to find the Clarendon Hotel.

The room we stayed in was CLEAN, large and comfortable, and the bed was fantastic. The Keurig in the room was a great plus along with the provided robes. My only complaint about the room was the tiiiiiiny bathroom. However, the great pool and hot-tub in the main courtyard really made the stay even better and we enjoyed chatting with other guests while enjoying a cocktail or beer from Gallo Blanco (which incidentally, is also fantastic!).

My biggest issue was the "resort fee." I really deplore the addition of the resort fee tacked on after you check in - PLEASE just include this in the regular price of a room when you check in...but also, this isn't reaaaaaaally a resort, so why such an outrageous "resort fee?" Still, fee and all, the Clarendon Hotel is worth it, and provided us with a great place to stay in Phoenix.

This was the place I was most looking forward to eating at in Vegas. I'm sad to say I was disappointed. 

The food was amazing, but the atomosphere and service were way below the the prices they charge. It felt like a cheap club with fantastic food. Very disconnected. Our server was condecending. She seemed annoyed we didn't order "enough" (she'd recommended 2-3 cold dishes, 2-3 hot dishes, and 2 sushi rolls) but that was our choice. We'd had a late lunch. 

If you just want good food, I'd recommend saving your money and going elsewhere. If you're a 20 or 30-something and want a party atmosphere and don't care about the bill, this could be fun for you.

I had high hopes for Craftsteak, and it definitely delivered. Fantastic food in a classy yet unpretentious environment, and amazing service. 

Some notes: 
-We ordered the cheaper steaks on the menu, and they were AMAZING. Melt in your mouth. Hard to imagine how good the Waygu and other pricey ones would be. But don't feel like you'll be shortchanged by ordering the cheaper ones. 
-Don't skip salads. The fava bean salad was the best thing I ate. Who knew a salad could be so good. 
-Sit at the bar before dinner if you have time. Our reservation was running a bit late, so we had a drink. The bartenders make the most delicious, strong drinks. 

If you love steak and want a classy dinner in Vegas, go here! You won't be disappointed.

Ate at China Poblano when I was in Vegas last week and hadn't looked at any Yelp reviews prior. I'm surprised to find it only has 3 stars on here. I thought it was AMAZING. Most importanly, it was priced appropriately, unlike so many places in Vegas.

Some notes:

-The atmosphere was fun (decor is amazing!)
-Service was great
-Food was creative and delicious
-A few dishes were a miss (a noodle soup with the word "ugly" in the name), but most were spot on. 
-Mexican food was slightly better than the Chinese, but that makes sense given Jose's backgound. 
-The salt-air margaritas are genius.

My boyfriend & I went to Jozo yesterday after the gym and thought to check this place out since we've been seeing a lot of hype. The place is nice and quiet. Menu has a good variety of options from boba to coffee to smoothies. 

We ordered two drinks which was the Classic Taiwanese Milk Tea and the Signature Thai Tea. Milk tea was alright, it wasn't as sweet nor milky as most boba places. Thai tea was just like your regular Thai tea that you get at restaurants. And the boba was unusually smaller than your regular boba which was surprising coming from a boba place.

What was really disappointing was the amount of ice that was in the drink! My boyfriend and I took two sips of the milk tea to try the flavor and noticed that the cup was pretty much ice! The 12oz cup (not even the bottle) was filled with 2/3 ice & 1/3 tea. I know it's being nit picky but I feel like I got gypped paying $4.50. Mind you, they were out of their cool bottles which comes standard with their drinks and still payed for the same price for a plain regular plastic cup - no name or anything. 

Overall, I think Jozo is jumping in with the trend of hipster branding but is lacking quality on the flavor. Wish I had a better experience!

You're not gonna find a much better breakfast in this city ... or anywhere really. Breakfast is breakfast, but they do it right and its delicious every time.

Get the lyonnaise potatoes with your meal. They're delicious. My personal favorite is the Tex Mex omelette. Guacamole at breakfast time never fails.

Although the staff are very nice and the facility can accomodate a lot of people at once (ease of appointment times), I must say I was not thrilled by this place. The physical therapists are helpful, but compared to other places, are not attentive enough because they are often seeing many patients at once. I thought the service was very good until I visited other physical therapists that give much more one-on-one time and assess your progress much more closely.

Example: I was often left to do my stretches with the therapists mostly coming back to give me something else to do. Besides asking how I felt from time to time, they did not reassess my abilities to walk or stretch as other therapists have. How do they know what is working if they don't assess your progress?

I have both eaten in and taken out with a positive experience. 

From walking by, it doesn't look like the greatest place, but they have an interesting menu with different asian/asian fusion dishes so there's a little bit for everyone from the exotic to the simple.

The Malaysian Sate, which I had with beef, was delicious and came in a more than adequately sized portion. The Pad Thai is also a delicious meal. All of the appetizers and other dishes I tried were more than satisfactory. 

For a student on a budget, this place is both delicious and relatively inexpensive. I would recommend it to anyone who likes interesting tastes of Asia.

I was excited to visit the PBC solely to experience their "exotic" types of burger meat. I chose the salad bar option, which was poorly stocked. The selection did not look all that appetizing.

When ordering burgers, the first selections that we made were not available so I settled on a Bison Burger. It was not much to speak of from the bun to the toppings or even the meat itself. It wasn't memorable or particularly tasty. The french fries I tried seemed overdone and like they had been sitting out.

Frankly. I would not recommend this place. My meal left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. The food was not that good and the service also left something to be desired. The restaurant was a little dark, uncomfortable booths, and didn't have a nice atmosphere.... If you're in the area, you'd be better off at Red Robin,

Seviche has a lively, colorful atmosphere that added to the dining experience. Our server was very attentive and knew the menu very well. She was able to offer many suggestions. The rest of the wait staff was also helpful when it came to seating us, turning the air down, everything.

Served tapas style, the food is conducive to sharing and ordering lots of little things. We tried for all ranges of the menu and thought the dishes had interesting flavor profiles, were prepared well, and tasted great.

The seviche section allows you to choose a fish and a style of preparation -- they are delicious! The filet mignon was also a wonderful cut of meat.

Mojitos are a bit pricey at $9 a drink for the small glasses they are in, but are delicious all the same.

Fun atmosphere. Good food. Big beers.

I would suggest the appetizer sampler (the works). As many below me will agree, the sauerkraut balls are delicious. The bier cheese & pretzels were good too.

I had the Bayerischer Schweinsbraten (pork with sauerkraut and a potato dumpling). It was different than I expected as I'm not too familiar with German food, but still pretty good. The pork was cooked well and had a good sauce. I wish I had substituted mashed potatoes instead of the dumpling.

The times I have been here I was impressed at the food and service in comparison to a Red Robin I had visited several years ago. We were seated quickly and taken care of by the wait staff.

I had the Prime Chophouse Burger and the Burnin' Love Burger on two separate occasions. My food came out hot, fresh, and cooked to my liking. The fries were all newly made. 

Because it is a chain, you know going in that you won't be gettin extravagant food, but for a burger & fries kind of meal there are a lot of choices, many of which are good.

On the multiple occasions that I have gone to this restaurant, I have always had a positive and very-filling experience. 

Their bread is delicious and hot. The server always brings out tons for us. I would say most of the dishes are standard Italian fare. I have not been disappointed by the Pasta Bravo, Eggplant Parm, or the side salads.

The best thing I have tried here was the Chicken Scaloppini. The chicken is covered in melted cheese and has a great lemon sauce. I would highly, highly recommend this dish.

For dessert, try the apple turnover thing with ice cream. You won't be disappointed.

I had a banquet event here and I was quite impressed with the service, as well as the atmosphere. The wait staff was very friendly and was able to keep everyone's order straight, despite the large group.

I ordered a chicken dish that had a creamy sauce, some potatoes, and asparagus. It was a great dish, served hot. It had way more complex flavors than I was expecting. I also tried a bite of the pasta with vegetables.

In a catered, sit down dinner service, I usually don't expect the food to be great or hot, but the Grand Concourse is a nice exception.

Ice cream is made on the premises with a variety of traditional and very unique flavors. Walking past these place you can smell the waffle cones and sweet treats that are made behind their doors. Definitely a place to check out.

Negatives: 

Cash only. I think they have a machine where you can take out money through an atm-like transaction, but it does charge.

Although delicious and I swear by it, I think their ice cream is a little over-priced.

Having eaten here several times, I was unsure between 3 and 4 stars as some visits/meals were better than others. Pretty solid fare, bar food type. Not the best atmosphere inside - kind of dark, gets a bit loud, still enjoyable though.

Highly Recommended:
Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese 
Skinny Dip (Buffalo Chicken Dip with Chips)
Hog Heaven, especially because of the side horseradish sauce.
Russet/Sweet Potato Fry Mix

Average:
Rosemary's Breast
Burger
Salads (in general)

They are known for having great pizzas, but I've only ever had a bite here and there.

Half price after 11 is always super crowded.
Good happy hour beer prices.

When getting takeout, I do feel the portions are smaller.

I had the Bistro Burger with a side order of french fries. The burger was brought out to my table and I found it be simple, but delicious. The fries were hot and had a nice salt & pepper seasoning.

Although I did not try the salad, it looked great -- a ton of options, friendly staff to help you with your selections. Once you pick everything, they chop it and give you dressing. The salad was what I thought to be a big portion, much bigger than Panera and customized to what you want.

This is a great concept. I'm sure the place will do well. I'm told at lunch the line is already out the door and its not even the school year yet...

Its also nice how they have garage style doors at the front to keep a nice breeze coming through and leave the place feeling more open.

They have a great referral program where you can give people a certificate for a free haircut and in return you get $5 off of your next cut. The free haircut got me in and now its my regular place.

I got my last haircut from Ken who was great. He gave me the type of haircut I wanted while also adding his expertise. I loved the way he dried and styled my hair too.

I came here for lunch and was rather disappointed with both the service and the food.

We were a large party of 8, but the restaurant was not very busy and service was still slow. The waitress had to be asked multiple times to bring napkins, etc.. and didn't really check in. Even getting the check and getting out was slow.

The food took a long time to come out. I had the pulled pork tacos and was very disappointed. They were SO greasy and didn't have a ton of flavor. I got the "bottom of the barrel" fries, which did not impress either.

I wanted to like this place, but would not recommend it based on my experience.

I love these hot sandwiches. It is a big rtion that I can rarely finish in one sitting. If you eat in, you also get fries for free.

The service is pretty quick, although they do get quite busy at lunch time. The sandwiches come out hot and to order. I usually get the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak with L,T,M,O and always enjoy it. They also offer adding an egg, which can be yummy.

Highly recommend for a delicious hot sandwich at lunch or dinner.

Negatives:
- The restaurant itself looks kinda run-down from the furniture, to the floors, to the poor lighting. Although they seem to be going for an "old" look, it could really use a facelift.

- They only take CASH. They have a ATM-like machine to get cash, but it will charge you for the transaction.

- Wish they were open late!

My goodness me! It's a regular "Dump on Los Sombreros Festival" here in Yelpland. Hey, people -- it's a perfectly fine Mexican restaurant. Well, maybe it's not perfect, but my meals here over the past five years have always been good, and I consider Los Sombreros a great place to take out-of-town guests. If I were to grade it on a pretentiousness scale, it actually rates better and is more inviting than Barrio Cafe. So give the place a break -- try the guacamole, the chicken mole, the lamb adobo, any of the skirt steak entrees and any of the seafood dishes.

Giving four stars to China Chili doesn't necessarily mean I think the place is fantastic -- but the spicy garlic eggplant is fantastic, and I'm still pondering its fantasticness hours later. My husband and I also enjoyed the rest of our meal -- yiu-shan chicken and one of the house specialties, black pepper prawns and scallops. Yes, I concur with other reviewers that some of the dishes are not gonna be fantastic. Still, I look upon the place as reliable, clean, moderately priced and efficient. I don't need P.F. Chang's.

Maybe the four stars is too generous after just one visit, but there's something about this place that's very comforting. Maybe it's the community seating, or the simple white bowls your veggies come in, or maybe it's the simple fact that you're eating your veggies and enjoying them too. I tried a yummy coconut curry with crispy tofu and appreciated that it was just the right portion for the price. I'm gonna try a vegan tsoynami with vegan tsoft tserve "ice cream" (spelling is correct) next time I go.

Through unusual circumstances, I ate at three Thai restaurants within 24 hours the other day -- Bejarong Thai in Mesa for dinner, Thai Lahna for lunch the next day, and Malee's Thai Bistro for dinner that evening. And the winner is ... good ol' dependable Thai Lahna. I realize, though, that I am in a bit of a rut as to what I order there and need to branch out to some of their seafood and vegetarian entrees before I can call myself a Thai food aficionado. Also, my Far Eastern journey led to the pleasant discovery of Bejarong, which comes in second. Malee's -- I appreciate your twists on Thai food, but my half-plate entree was not worth the $9 I paid for it.

It was back in the '80s when Town and Country Shopping Center was a hoppin' place on weekend nights because of its great selection of trendy restaurants. Maybe those heydays are gone, but as someone from the neighborhood, I am glad to see a few small "boutique" restaurants going in, and Cyprus Pita Grill might well start drawing more crowds. The food is carefully prepared and presented, the atmosphere is cute faux Greek, and the service is pleasant. The lamb on my gyro plate was tender and scrumptious and I regret I didn't order any appetizers. A neighboring table was ordering all appetizers instead of entrees and they looked wonderful. Three of us sated ourselves for a mere $45 and resolved to stop by more often.

El Molino makes the chimichanga by which I rate all other chimichangas -- if another restaurant doesn't give it  just the right crispiness, with just the right accompaniments of cheese, guacamole and sour cream, then it just doesn't cut it. By the way, after almost 30 years in Phoenix I've eaten more chimichangas than I care to admit. Get El Molino's chicken or machaca chimi, which is often a nightly special for under $8, and you will be in sinus-clearing chimi heaven.

Must echo Brian O. about the lack of circulation in the booth area. Not good when the temp is 113 degrees, no matter how many times the server refills your water. By the way, our service was good and efficient, and we liked the guacamole prepared tableside. Also, we liked the many vegetarian options and the way the shrimp tacos were prepared. I hardly ever venture out to Glendale, but at least now I know of a decent Mexican restaurant there.

This is good and bad: good, because I realize, as hordes of other people do, that this is some of the most innovative Mexican food in town; bad, because tonight I realized the in-crowd often is, in its lust for a good meal, downright rude. One set of patrons muscled its way to the front of the line as the restaurant geared up for its 5 p.m. Saturday opening. I mean, really, just get in line. Then, once we were dining, we noticed another set of patrons coming in the back door and just seating themselves at an empty table. The waitperson, to her credit, remained polite toward them. Sigh, I'm trying a week night next time ...

I would agree that the food and pastries here are above average, but when I walk into a small, crowded, noisy place and don't know where to go for a simple beverage and no employee seems to notice my perplexity or to care, I come away feeling the place is pretentious, snobby, confusing and out of my league. Which is too bad, because it's right in my neighborhood. I sense that if you're a regular here, then probably you feel welcome and the employees chat you up all time. But not all of us can afford to be regulars here. This is at least the third time that La Grande Orange's uppity ambience has annoyed me, so I don't feel guilty about the poor review.

This is better than average mall food, and I love the cookies and muffins. There oughta be a yellow caution tape around the establishment, though, because its ultra-centralized location forces way too many cream cheese brownie breaks and those clothes I'm trying on are not gonna fit me after all. I do have to wonder if the portions for salads and sandwiches are getting smaller. A customer next to me griped about it to the cashier, and lo and behold, my tasty pasta salad was a little on the chintzy side.

Beware the ladies of Teavana! I say this good-naturedly, but also as a warning. Let me say first that as a tea freak I love that this place exists, and now I can go to either the Biltmore or Scottsdale Fashion Square location. But here's what happened to me, and I repeat it here as a warning: I walked by the store with no intention of going in. Thirsty, I sampled a tea by the door, then another tea. Then I thought, what the heck -- I walked a few feet into the store and sampled another tea. That's when a lady of Teavana snagged me, chatting quite knowledgeably about the tea I was tasting and inviting me, like a Siren, to get a whiff from a tea canister at the counter. Expertly, she fanned the lid of the canister over the leaves so that I could get the full effect. Oh my, that orange-pomegranate-whatever smelled good. Must I take some home? Oh yes, I must. That lovely 8-ounce canister of herbal tea will be $36, please. Yikes!

I'm no seafood aficionado, but this place seemed pretty good to me, and I hope it sticks around because fresh seafood like this (and at these prices) is fairly unusual here in the desert. Our table tried the fish and chips, swordfish, seafood kebab and catfish -- and all were satisfied. As noted in other reviews, the staff is jovial and the atmosphere is pleasant. Whew -- saves me a trip to Boston!

Seems like the menu has been overhauled since I last dined here a couple of years ago. But NBD. We skipped the appetizers, knowing that our entrees would be plenty filling. The tasty appetizer selection is worth considering, though, if you're at Flo's with a fairly big party. We liked all of our dishes -- the spicy bean curd, the shrimp and pan-fried noodles and the chicken vindaloo, with the latter being maybe the weakest of the bunch. With it being early and uncrowded on a hot and humid evening, the wait staff was friendly and very attentive. Try out this location before the snowbirds return.

I'm trying to decide -- when it comes to pizza, am I a crust person or a topping person? If I am the latter, then I would say that the toppings we tried on three different pizzas were all good but could have been more plentiful. We especially liked the artichoke and olive pizza. Whatever exotic cheeses the chefs put on the pizzas are terrific but are just dotted on. I left the restaurant last night feeling crusty, which is to say I love the wood-fired, slightly burned, soft-on-the-inside crust. So much so that I almost finished off the crust left on my carb-watching daughter's plate. We'll see where things fall in the great crust/topping dilemma next time I visit.

Lovely decor, good location, celebrity tie-in ... and food that left me wishing I had ordered something different. Out of our party of four, two of us ordered mediocre dishes -- the vegetarian chile relleno and the chicken mole casserole. But the two other dishes were fine -- spinach and mango salad and chicken enchiladas suiza. The chunky salsa was also quite good, especially for those of us who've deprived ourselves of tomatoes recently. Let this be a lesson to you (and me): read reviews on Yelp for recommendations on a new restaurant's best dishes before you go. Also, a note to our server: when a customer says his dish is just OK, then DOH! -- follow up by asking how it could be better. This is especially necessary at a new place.

When we found out we had to spend the night in Las Vegas because of a cancelled flight to Europe, we surely hadn't foreseen a night at the Tropicana. That old place? But it turned out fine, and I'm glad we were there AFTER the remodel, from the sounds of the BEFORE. We walked through the Excalibur and, boy, does that place need to be brought out of the Middle Ages. As for the Trop, I'd like to put in a good word for the buffet at Cafe Nikki. It was simple and almost elegant and not what we expected from a buffet on the Strip. The cafe has a beach theme, which keeps things light and modern. Everything we tried tasted good, or good enough, and the desserts were crazy good. I appreciated that the chefs were hovering behind the buffet table every time I went up -- it showed me they cared.

Have you ever had one of those experiences where you saunter out of a restaurant after your first visit there and you think, "Gee, not bad ... I'll be back," and then the next day you mention the restaurant to friends and they shoot you down. Not such a great place after all, they convince you. Well, in hindsight I see that my friend was right about the food here being on the bland side. Yes, it does seem to be prepared with your arteries in mind. But what is Indian food without creamy richness and sweat-inducing spice? I give Bombay Spice kudos for the innovative plating and for allowing you to order two entrees for the price of one. The happy hour is a terrific idea, and I might be back just for the $4 appetizers and wine.

I get the feeling that little ol' Chop and Wok -- with its bar area, drink menu and kitschy tropical/beach bum decor -- is gearing up to be a twentysomethings hangout at night, and that's just fine. But I'll keep going for the quieter hours and the lunch specials, when the traditional Chinese chicken and vegetable dishes are all I need. Two tips: 
Try the crab puffs, which have been a Chop and Wok specialty for years. And park in the back instead of trying to maneuver in and out of a space from the busy intersection of Scottsdale and Shea.

This musical isn't going to win any Tony awards, but if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies you'll enjoy it BUT only if you get the splatter zone. 

Like the movies the musical is packed full of campy humor and gore which is exactly why you love the movies. The song's lyrics are at most times over powered by the music, but I would have to say my favorite one was "WTF."

This reminded me of Community Theater with a few surprisingly good singers, terrible props and uncomfortable seats. I found it really funny that you could all ready see the tears and faded blood stains from past performances on their clothes from the very start. 

My group did the splatter zone and we LOVED it. They get you from all sides, but mostly it came from the back right. With the spaltter zone you get VIP seating, 2 for 1 bar drinks and a white Evil Dead t-shirt.

The odd thing about the "blood" was it was warm. I never did get use to that.

If you've seen all 3 movies, you will have fun. However, it does take a moment to get into. 

Here are a few things to think about:
-Don't go if you think this is going to be scary. It's not.
-Don't go if you are offended by swearing. They do it A LOT.
-Don't go if you hate campy movies with cult followings.
-Don't go if you never seen any of the Evil Dead movies.
-Don't go if you hate musicals.
-Don't go if you don't want to get "pinkish water" coloring on your clothes. It can get on you EVEN IF you aren't in the spatter zone. Mainly the first and second row behind the VIP area.
-Don't go because someone talked you into it. You won't like it. We saw a few couples/groups not come back after the second act because someone was whining they wanted to go.

DO GO-
-If you love the Evil Dead movies.
-If you have an open mind.
-If you are willing to "gamble" $40-$70 dollars on something you may not like.
-If you quoting the popular movie lines with the actors. The crowd was shouting these lines. It was a great vibe.

***The key is to expect the worst. That's what I did and I had fun.***

Decent haircut, not so good shave. 

Classic barber chairs at big mirrors in gold painted wooden frames sitting on what look like antique-shop dressers (but they all match so probably not) plus photos of James Dean, The Rat Pack, and Laurel & Hardy (!) and classic rock on the radio. Nice enough surroundings.

Had trouble communicating with my barber, whose English was limited. Simple questions were met with blank looks. We managed, but not without difficulty. The haircut was fine, not that I needed anything out of the ordinary. Oddly, the shampoo followed the cut, so he was working with somewhat dirty hair.

The hot towel shave was a real disappointment. First, the chairs do not recline at all, so there is no sense of relaxation. You either sit up straight and strain your neck to bend your head back, or slide forward in the chair and strain your back. The hot towel is perfunctory. The shave was unpleasant and sometimes painful, and my barber left three nicks on my neck. The cucumber gel afterward was a welcome finish.

Let me get the one big negative out of the way: nowhere in the place are prices shown. Not anywhere. Not on the menu board, not on the counter or the display case or on any kind of sign. Sure, people who own homes in Baby Point can ignore such trivialities, but not the rest of us. More transparency, please!

Otherwise, we love this spot. Bright, airy, and mostly comfortable (except for those metal stools), with exceptional coffee, fascinating and unusual beverages (I tried the tumeric latte most recently) and a great philosophy about environmental respect and quality product.

Location is a bit out of the way. But while not especially convenient for us, we go anyway. The video screen with updated bus information is a great idea--riders can grab a coffee without worrying about missing their ride. Wifi seems good, music is listenable, and faces are friendly.

We are looking forward to future visits. Just let us know the prices, okay?

They rarely answer their phone. In fact, most times you cannot even leave a voicemail. They responded to emails most of the time but we had to ask every question three times before their responses actually answered anything. Trying to schedule an appointment was nuts. When the day finally arrived nobody showed up. No notice of cancellation, no apology afterwards.

The good: sparkling bathroom and some (but far from all) excellent cleaning elsewhere.
The not-so-good: Despite my emphasis on dusting, the tops of picture frames and other obvious surfaces were untouched. Despite my asking for a protective cover over the bed while dusting the ceiling fan above, they dusted right over the bedding. Other specific requests, which I wrote down for them, were forgotten or ignored. Even though a total time for cleaning was arranged, they managed the time badly, taking over an hour on one small room (wasting time on blinds and making the bed). I approved an extra hour but they went beyond that, too, without my approval--and of course charged me for it. Finally, sharing these and other concerns with the company resulted in "Thanks for your thoughts." No adjustment, apology or explanation.

In the past I've found them to have a decent selection with fairly good quality, but have been annoyed at their unwillingness to sell smaller filets.  

Today, however, I bought some cod which turned out to be absolutely foul when I got home (about 20 minutes after leaving the store).  I won't go back.

This is some of the better sushi in Toronto, but that's unfortunately not saying much.  I had take-out from Japango this evening, ordering only specials: yellowtail, uni, and horse mackerel.  The yellowtail was good, the uni excellent, but the horse mackerel was dried out and gave off the smell of too-old fish (and yes, I know that mackerel is an oily "fishy" fish even when fresh).  The ohitashi side dish featured spinach which hadn't been washed - plenty of crunchy dirt/sand in there.   I'll wait 'til I go to Vancouver, NYC, Seattle, or Chicago to have sushi again.

I rarely get sick and, when I do, I always get better rather quickly so me going to StatClinix on Tuesday, July 7, was a big deal. I had been having trouble swallowing due to a major sore throat. I kept getting the cold sweats and could not sleep at night due to a cough and would gasp for air. After 2 hours at the Clinic, Dr. Greg Reser said nothing was wrong and to keep taking over-the-counter meds. I told him nothing had been working and that I was headed out of town soon so wanted to treat this before it turned into anything big. To that he said "come back in 3 days if you aren't better." I mentioned to him in 3 days I would be gone for 3 weeks, which he chose to blatantly ignore. So here we are 2 days later and I now have white spots on my tonsils - a major sign of strep which is common in my family. I just got off the phone with the Clinic and they said there is a different doctor I could go see today. I asked how much that would cost and they could not answer. Why would I return to a place that appears to be scamming people for their money? It shouldn't be this hard to receive meds that are desperately needed. If you are feeling ill, I beg you to go elsewhere rather than waste your money here.

Stop searching. Bill is going to be your home inspector. I rarely review but I had to find my login again just to put in this review for FYI Home Inspections.

I did my research with a good number of home inspectors and it was just obvious when calling them they give you the marketing pitch trying to appease you. When I called Bill he was straight up, and the real deal.

I am a buyer who was looking for a new home to live in. I had some unfortunate circumstances arise on my home inspections and Bill went above and beyond in his service to accommodate my situations because he really does care. 

His inspections are thorough and accurate. He finds everything that can be a problem with the house. Trust me I did more than one inspection with him. It's pretty crazy if you join him in the inspection to see how good he is. 

I thank Bill for the professionalism and quality of service that he has provided me. I will definitely recommend him to everyone and use him again if I need to do a home inspection. Really I rarely do reviews, just this morning my dentist office asked me to do a quick review on their computer and I was like nah. The lady got mad! Bill was so excellent that it made me want to review him here.

Extremely overpriced for the amount of food you get. I used to go here all the time. The food was delicious. 

What changed was the portion of food. Most places increase prices when they need to. Not this place. No, what they did here is a disgusting disservice to the customer. They instead lessened the portion of the food by more than twice it was. It's less than the kids portion compared to some places. Yes! So now if you want the similar portion that you had before, then you have to pay for it twice. I think it would still be less than what one portion was though. Which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced. 

For example, the last time I went here I had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam. I asked for no beef and replace with more spam. This is what I usually used to get. So you know what they gave me? 2 tiny pieces of spam! The chicken portion was also minuscule. And a tiny scoop of rice too, not even a whole scoop. 

I eat at many places in Vegas and around the country as I travel all the time. I mostly use yelp to give great reviews for amazing places that need more attention from customers. This place though, I logged in for the first time in a long time to give this one star review. It is that bad compared to what they used to be. It is way more expensive than every Manhattan non-waiter place I have been to, along with Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Miami, Toronto, etc. 

Guys, if this portion issue has changed please let me know. I will then try it again and see for myself and update my review accordingly. I used to love this place, but now it just still gets me mad when I think about what I paid for and then got.

UPDATE: May 2017
I want back again to see if they changed anything. I went back again to see if it was a fluke. It looks like they did raise the portions. Not as big as it used to be but this is much better then before where I gave a one star review. Food was still delicious!

This is great authentic Japanese curry! I have been going here for a while and it is delicious every time. I mainly eat the chicken cutlet or the curry udon. I went to Japan a few months ago and had curry several times while there, specifically Tokyo. Like around Shinjuku and Akihabara. I have eaten here before going to Japan and it was awesome but now that I have been to Japan I can say that it is authentic. It wasn't too far from how delicious the curry was in Japan. The owner is a cool guy too. I think I remember him saying he is from Akihabara.

Here in Vegas you probably won't find a Japanese curry as good as here, so take advantage!

Best Chinese food in this side of town. Almost everything is great. Their take-out and delivery is extremely fast. The only dish that is not great is the Pad Thai, it is pretty bad to be honest.

I purchased a short sale property in Equestrian and needed a VERY reliable and thorough inspector to make sure I knew what I was getting into. I had used Tim O'Neall once before so I gave him a call. He was extremely professional (arrived on time, discussed rates and services up front) and then an absolutely amazing and thorough job inspecting my potential home. Armed with a book of information from the major (A/C units) to the minor (cracked switch plates, bad doorbell) provided by Tim, I was able to negotiate a better price on my house, AND (more importantly) to know exactly what I was getting into. We've been here for over 2 years now, and I can honestly say that I probably would not have made the leap had I not been armed with the confidence that Tim's inspection and report provided me. I would (and have) recommend Tim to anyone in Phoenix who ever needs a home inspection.

Let's be honest, with out Kitchen Nightmares I would have no idea ABC existed.  I had called ahead of time to book a table, Samy said to just stop in and would take care of us. A couple hours later we had shown up, and he knew it was me who called... Very personal! We had a table for 4. It was very quite, the music was at a good volume. I had the Chicken Alfredo and flat bread. It was excellent. 5 plates of food for around $70, I thought it was a good price! Go try it out!

Great food and excellent service. The Chirashi bowl was well presented and filling. Fish was bold colored and fresh tasting! The clam hot pot was more than enough food for one person with plenty of clams. The meatball and chicken skewers were crispy and tender. The pork was very good as well, but a little tougher than the chicken and meatballs. 

Warm and comfortable ambience, attentive and pleasant service, and very good food. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes!

She has years of experience doing both men and women's hair - I brought my boyfriend in and he loved his haircut also! Her prices are incredibly reasonable and she offers great deals on styling products. I've recommended her to my friends and family and no one has left disappointed!

Ive been going here for a while (regularly), but lately I haven't seen the owner and it seems like theyve endlessly been rotating deadbeat employees through there. They're screwing up a ton of orders, and they oftentimes dont know the specials or how to run the register....not to mention theyre unprofessional. This place is going downhill QUICK and it's a shame.

Is it just me, or does the staff at Trax Farms have a terrible attitude? Dont get me wrong, its not EVERYONE there....but in general, everyone just seems so miserable. In my experience, the staff usually reflects the attitude of management/ownership....so that cant be a good sign. Ive been going there since I was a toddler,  Ive been there more recently because we moved into the area. Im so disappointed. Not only is it expensive (which I was willing to deal with), but now I have to deal with a snooty staff that seems annoyed by every interaction or order. Maybe its because Trax is now out of the farming/customer service business and more into the Gas/Oil business? Oh well. Simmons and Bebout are right up the road and theyre definitely more welcoming.

My wife recently took our puppy to Brush Run animal clinic and the Vet there told my wife to feed our puppy Milo "any of the dog foods in the grocery store...the natural foods out there are just a scam" Uhhh really?? Milo just went in for vaccinations and they gave him rabies, dap, and lepto all at once...then sent her on her way. No warnings, No "what to look for"...just collect their $$ and send you on your way. After observing Milo being lethargic and reading about what may becausing the discharge from his eyes (formaldehyde,mercury in the 5-8 vaccines that he received at once), Ive decided to research other Vets in the area and take our puppy elsewhere.

Yep, it was pretty good. The dumplings were by far the best I've ever had. They also take credit/debit as well as cash, which was really convenient. Right in the heart of Chinatown. We got a plate of pork dumplings each, and were pretty pleased with our last minute dinner decision. Would recommend to dumpling snobs.

Awesome hotel. Super modern, very friendly bilingual staff, nice location. The parking situation in the city is not the best of course, but for just a few dollars more than public parking. They will valet park your car- totally worth it. Oh, and good, speedy free wifi. We probably won't visit Montreal again, but if we did, we would go back to this hotel. Great experience!

Excellent Brazilian Steakhouse.  13 different kinds of meat, hot & cold buffet items that are fantastic and dessert buffet my hubby squeezed in at the end.  I was too stuffed to partake in dessert but it looked very yummy.   I've been to the other Brazilian places in town and this one shot to the top for us.  We considered keeping this place secret but we just can't...it's that good.  Great service and wonderful ambiance rounded out this visit.  We will be back.  Highly recommend!

Went for Hubby's birthday and had a wonderful experience.  

We had the Cold Smoked Elk Carpaccio, Pickled Blueberries, First Pressed Canola & Foie Gras Parfait, Apple Bourbon Gelée, Compressed Apple to start.  Excellent choices!  I'm not a pate fan but the Foie Gras was fabulous.  

For dinner, Hubby had the Seared Halibut, White Bean and Chorizo Ragout, Clams, Blistered Cherry Tomato Sauce Vierge and I had the Birch Smoked Duck Breast, Steel Cut Oat and Mushroom Risotto, Braised Red Cabbage, Natural Duck Jus.  Absolutely delicious!  

And we ended with Brie Cheesecake, Poppy Seed Honey, Raspberry Fluid Gel - yeah, not so much. I love Brie and I love cheesecake but together, not so fabulous.  Just not my taste I guess.

All in all, a great experience I would definitely repeat.

Not pleased with the sneaky upsale.  I haven't had nails for years and I wanted to treat myself. I wanted acrylic but apparently "acrylic" sounds like UV gel with shellac.  They started with acrylic tips and I'd never had gel before so I didn't know what they were doing until it was too late.  Wasn't pleased with the gel nails either - super thick and they were totally skimpy with the nail colour.  I will never again get gel nails and I certainly won't be back where I don't get what I asked for in the first place.  They completely ignored what I asked for and put the most expensive nail service they have on me.  It wasn't until I paid that I knew exactly what service I had received.  Not impressed!

YUM!!  I've been searching for a Pho spot for awhile now.  Nothing compares to this place. I had the #2-Rare Beef Pho and hubby had A-Sate Chicken.  Broth was excellent and flavourful. Hubby said it's the best Sate he's ever had and the shredded chicken just melted in his mouth.  He loved it so much, it brought tears to his eyes.  Service was wonderful as well.

O-M-G!  I used to go for brunch with my mother at the Inn at Lake Bonavista.  Lets just say, I've come home again!  I wanted the brunch at The Lake House to take me back to all those years of wonderful brunch in a spectacular environment.  I was definitely not disappointed.  The two different kinds of eggs benny had me giddy - I chose one and my Mother chose the other - both are fantabulous!  My hubby and stepfather chose the brisket which both spoke very highly of.  The blood orange mimosas were fantastic and the sticky toffee pudding was divine.  We will definitely be back sooner rather than later.  I can't wait to have dinner!

After desperately searching for good pho and reading these reviews, I thought I'd give this little place a try.  Staff was awesome but the pho and spring rolls...not so much.  I always order the rare beef pho wherever I go. I'm not a big fan of fatty beef but I had to order the one with the fatty brisket to get my rare beef.  Broth was different than I've had before and pretty good - had a nutmeg like taste to it.  Little disappointed there were no basil leaves to add though.  The spring rolls were meh and the shrimp salad rolls were empty - three shrimp, some noodles and a sprig of lettuce (I mean sprig too).  All in all, wasn't horrible, just meh.

Kildare's is our go-to pub.  It's not even in our neighborhood but worth the drive.  Food is great, beer is awesome, staff is fabulous.  We sit at the bar so our service is always fantastic.  I have not experienced the inattentive staff issues mentioned in other reviews.  My food is never cold, which was also mentioned in other reviews.  If it was, I would send it back and give them a chance to correct before mentioning it in a review.  Never had a problem with the service or food.  I highly recommend this pub to everyone I meet.

I've been going to Bolsa for a few years now and I just realized I've never written a review for it.  I love Bolsa. I usually get beef pho with a side of spring rolls.  Yum!  But recently, I've branched out and tried other things on the menu. My favourite so far has to be Happy's Coconut Rice - phenomenal.  And the homemade hoisin sauce is outstanding - I don't like sweet very much and the sauce has just enough sweet without going overboard.  I introduced some friends to Bolsa and now it seems Bolsa gets picked whenever someone celebrates a birthday.  Highly recommend Bolsa!

We went to Avec Bistro for our anniversary in June 2013 and it was beyond our expectations. The food was fabulous and the service was exceptional.  I had the duck and my husband had the lamb. Both were outstanding - I really dislike lamb but this was so good, even I would order the lamb.  We had some questions about wine pairings and suggestions given by our waitress were bang on. Everything about Avec Bistro gave us such a fantastic meal experience that we will definitely be back soon.

This was our 4th rainforest cafe we have visited. My son picked it for his 5th birthday dinner, worst rainforest expierence ever! Our waitress was very rude, our order was incorrect twice, and she kept making it worse, by screwing it up more, I didn't realize a plain cheeseburger was so hard! For a $200 bill I didn't realize we would have to beg so much for re-fills and correct food. My son enjoyed it, and at the end of the day that was what was important, however next year I'll talk him into something else!!

After sitting in our booth for 15 minutes being ignored, we sent one of the kids to the counter asking where to order at. another 5 minutes passes and a waiter comes to the table, service was slow, we had to beg for drink refills, 1 of the kids meals was made wrong, and my 15 yr old brother ordered bbq wings from the appetizer section and they brought him chicken strips and fries, he ate that because he didn't want to wait even longer then we had. We won't go back. Tried it once, and that was enough,  a shame the food sucks because my husband really liked his shake!

Tried WORTH on a whim after seeing other Yelp reviews.  Had the Chicken Veggie Hash for lunch, which was *amazing*!  It comes with "roasted seasonal vegetables" which happened to be sweet potatoes and asparagus.  DELICIOUS!  

Another bonus is that they offer GLUTEN FREE options for the sandwiches.  Any sandwich can be served without bread over a bed of greens and sweet potatoes (excluding grilled cheese).  

Give it a try, it's WORTH it!

Service was great, and the food was tasty, but I had an experience that left a bad taste in my mouth. My bill came out to $23 and some change, and I paid cash with two $20 bills. When the server came to take my payment, he asked if I wanted change.... really. Sorry, bud, it was good, but not tipping 75% good. Then, when he brings me my change, he kept the coins for himself and gave me only the bills. If this is customary at upscale restaurants (or those that are trying to be) then I'm not "A-OK" with that, and that's why I'm giving L'Albatros a 2-star rating. I wasn't going to make a scene over 70 cents in front of my party, but I needed to share this experience so others are aware.

Delicious food and comfortable atmosphere. The cafeteria-style line is different but it made the experience unique. The piano player was a nice touch. My only complaint is the price tag - they have no servers but the final cost is a bit high for what you get, almost as if they've added in a gratuity anyway. 15% cheaper fare would get 5-stars from me.

Old Man Bar is the best. Perhaps it's not for everyone but there is no better weekday bar than OMB. Weekends can be a different story - during the summers the clientele tends to be 30-to-40-something "guidos" on Friday and Saturday night - but for the rest of the week it's a great place to drink. Mike and Keith are funny, friendly, and generous. Best bartenders ever!

Party of two, but didn't get noticed until over 20 minutes after we got seated and the food took well over an hour to reach us. The food was good, but not worth the wait or the price tag. The problem is the management - only one waitress worked the entire floor on a weekend evening! She had a couple bussers to help but it wasn't enough. Unless I hear that things have changed, I'll never go back.

I've been to Falafel at various times and days but the service remains consistently good. It usually takes just over 5 minutes for me to get my meal and never more than 10. The cost for a full meal - e.g. a bowl of soup, a sandwich, and a drink - is pretty good (~$10), and they have daily specials which are even cheaper. I've not had a bad experience here.

My only complaints, albeit minor, are a) that the sandwich wraps tend to be a little juicy/greasy for my liking; b) they generally won't bring you refills unless you go to the front counter or ask them as they walk through the dining room.

Many good things to say about Zanzibar. My exposure to their entire menu is limited, but what I had was delicious. You have to get the walleye cakes! Their chicken and cornbread is also very good. The kool-aid is overpriced but it is delicious.

The waitstaff was professional and the atmosphere is very relaxed.

Price tag is pretty good considering the amount and quality of the food you get.

My only complaint is the speed of service, but I haven't been there enough times to really deduct points because of it (may have been isolated incidences).

edit: I've been a few more times, and the speed or service hasn't really changed. They dining room temperature is also a little too toasty for my liking. Food is still delicious, though.

I had the Weiner schnitzel and my girlfriend had the Gypsy's cutlet. It was good, not great. I have to deduct points for inattentive servers and expensive fare ($43 for two people - just too much). Also they feel the need to remind you several times via their menu that it costs them money to accept credit cards - come on. They also automatically threw on a 15% gratuity. OK experience but I probably won't be returning.

NOT child-friendly in child-friendly Leslieville.  After walking 1 hour to get our baby to sleep, looking forward to a quiet lunch & a pint at the completely empty Roy, their bartender watched as I struggled to get my stroller through TWO heavy doors before informing me that "actually, we don't allow strollers in the restaurant" (i.e., We hate children.).   

Still hungry, thirsty, and well-deserving of a baby-break, we backtracked to longstanding Leslieville institution Velvet, and were warmly received.    

BTW, I parked my baby stroller next to the owner's scooter by the back booth.

So I really don't want to give this place two stars b/c this really doesn't reflect the food, but I have to b/c the service is sooooo slow! 

We had made a reservation for 9 and got there around 8:30 and they were able to seat us after about 10 minutes. Our waitress came over pretty quickly after we sat down but then it just went downhill from there. We had ordered drinks and the waitress brought my friend the wrong beer. We then ordered edamame and a bunch of sushi cut rolls, We were really hungry b/c we had just traveled to Vegas and went straight to dinner from the airport. We ordered the spicy tuna, salmon avocado, shrimp tempura and spicy scallop rolls. It then took about 45 mins. to get our rolls and we were starving! We ate those rolls pretty fast once they got to the table. We were still hungry, so for some reason we thought it would be a good idea to get some more rolls. Bad idea. The next set of sushi rolls took another hour. We almost wanted to cancel the order b/c it was taking so long. We were hungry but also tired and just wanted to get out of there. 

After we finally got the second set of sushi rolls, we immediately asked for our bill b/c we knew that would take a while, which we were right about. 

After about another 20 minutes, we were able to pay our bill and leave. 

As far as the sushi goes, it was really good. Our favorite was the shrimp tempura. Our least favorites were the spicy scallop and tuna b/c they were not spicy. 

The whole meal lasted almost 2.5 hours, which is pretty ridiculous. Not sure if I would go back b/c I don't think I have the patience.

We wanted to get married by an "Elvis" for our Vegas wedding and we were referred to Roland by where we were getting married (Denny's) and he was great!!  He was very nice and took the time to incorporate some things he had just learned about us into the ceremony.  His Elvis impersonation was great and his singing was really good!!  I would definitely recommend him!!

I made a reservation for a friend's birthday and went through the Bellagio concierge.  I had tried to make my reservation on the restaurant website but it said I had to call.  I should have done it through OpenTable b/c I never have problems with them.  The concierge had told me the dress was business casual and men cannot wear shorts, but when we were seated, I saw plenty of men wearing shorts, so that was a little irritating. 

Our dinner was great though!!!  I had ordered a dirty martin, but there was barely any olive juice in it, so I asked for more on the side.  For our appetizer, we got the charcuterie board, which was so good!!  The pickles were the best part!! They also give you really good bread and olive tapenade which was excellent.

For my entree, I had the seafood risotto, which was so good.  I probably shouldn't have eaten all the bread because I was getting really full, but I managed to eat almost all of my entree.  I also tried the tenderloin which was excellent!!  My friends also ordered the scallops for their meal, which they say was really good as well!!

We were really full for dessert, but we were celebrating a birthday, so we somehow ordered 3 desserts for 5 people!!  They did put a candle on one of the desserts, so that was nice.  
We tried the banana tiramisu, the chocolate peanut butter lava cake and the cookie butter creme brulee.  All of which were wonderful!!!!  We couldn't stop eating even though we were so stuffed!!!!  

Overall, the dinner was great and I definitely recommend this place!

We wanted something somewhat quick and thought this cafe would be good.  There was about a 5-10 min wait for a table and we were seated with a really good view of the pool area.  Then it went downhill from there.  

It took forever to put in a drink order and then once we got it, the drinks weren't even right.  We ordered 3 mimosas and one bloody mary and she brought 2 bloody marys and 2 mimosas, except the mimosas were just champagne.  

Once we ordered our food, it took forever to get the food!!!  Then when she did bring it, she gave some of our things to another table and then we had to wait for her to bring out new stuff!!  Even through all of that, the food was just ok.  I would just avoid this place and go somewhere else.

Our friends who live in Las Vegas recommend we go here to meet them for brunch on Sunday.  I was able to make a quick and easy reservation on Opentable and even changed it a few times without any problems.
We were seated really quickly and had the best waitress named Darlene.  Were waiting for 3 people in our group and while we waited, Darlene brought us complimentary pigs in a blanket.  We also wanted mimosas and she suggested the bottomless so we can try different kinds and kept bringing us different varieties.

The lunch menu did look good but the brunch menu looked so good, we had to go with that.  It's basically small plates and you all share.  There's so much to choose from that Darlene said she will take control and bring us almost everything.  And she wasn't lying!!  We had so much food, we felt bad wasting stuff when we were getting so full!!!!  Everything was fantastic!!  The one thing that we thought would be good was the churro tots.  They were a bit underwhelming, but still good.  

We were celebrating two birthdays and Darlene even "sang" to our table!!  She was so funny and attentive and everyone should have her as their waiter!!  

I will tell everyone that goes to Vegas to go here because it was great!!!

My friend was getting married in Las Vegas over the Memorial Day holiday and instead of having everyone spend a fortune at the fancy strip hotels, she picked the Tuscany, so everyone was able to get a good rate.

I was traveling with another one of my friend's and her husband and we got to the hotel around 2 p.m.  We waited in line to check in and asked if we could check in early.  We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.

We came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.

My room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.

After the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?

The food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.

The bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!

The pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  

On my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!

When it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.

I definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.  I appreciate that my friend picked a  place to help all the wedding guests save money, but it was an awful experience.

We ate at Fiamma before going to see Cirque de Soleil's Ka at MGM.  We made reservations for 6:45 p.m. and they were able to seat us right away.

The table was right by the entrance and my seat was right behind the menu where people walking by could check it out.  I didn't really like that table b/c a lot of people were walking by and then they were right next to the table looking at the menu.

Other than, that the food was excellent!  They gave us bread and olive oil, which was so good b/c we had two basket-fulls.  I ordered the sea bass and a side of potatoes and was completely stuffed.  I also had a glass of wine, which was great!  

The restaurant is definitely pricey and it would have been nice if it was a bit cheaper.

My review is for the wedding services they provide.  When my now-husband and I found out that we could get married at Denny's we decided that we had to do it.  I received excellent service once I was put in touch with Sheila, the manager.  She explained to me what I options I could choose from and we went from there.  In the beginning, we had chosen the cheapest option, but we were upgraded because we had a special guest musician perform for us.  The upgrades were great!  The flower bouquet and boutonniere was so pretty!!!  The cake pops were delicious and the set up looked great!  We had also wanted an Elvis minister, so they put us in touch with one and he was fantastic!!  I would definitely recommend getting married at Denny's if you are thinking about getting married in Vegas!

I'm not a big coffee drinker but their breakfast bagels are amazing. I always go with the farmhouse, plain bagel and maple smear. It's like a home made breakfast in a sandwich. The staff are always nice and when they makes the occasional mistake, they get out fixed within a minute or two. Highly recommend.

Was in the area doing some shopping and decided I needed to eat. Was going to hit one of the old standbys in the immediate area and noticed this place. Was up for something new so gave it a try. Dan was behind the counter and I told him I had never been here. He gladly have me a quick but informative rundown of the menu and a couple recommendations. I ended up going with the kalua pork rice bowl and couldn't have been more pleased. A mostly sweet dish with just the right amount of savory. Place was very clean and the menu was very simple to navigate. They have a selection of hot and soy sauces to add to your dish but I didn't find them necessary. In the plethora of Asian style places these days, this is a definite standout.

Went last week during the Happening Gourmand.  

From the fixed menu I chose the Garlic Escargot, Angus beef bavette, and Crème brûlée.  

Given Narcisse was the least expensive of the Happening Gourmand restaurants I was pleasantly satisfied with the meal.   

In fact out of the 3 HG restaurants we tried Narcisse was my favorite.  

The standouts for me were -

The escargots  - nice twist on traditional escargots with cheese melted.
The beef bavette - inexpensive but well prepared piece of meat.
The french fries - savory and lots of them.

The service was a tad on the slow side but i think it was more to do with our waitress than systemic of the restaurant.

I've eaten here several times now.  

Really enjoyed the ramen.  Large bowls brimming with tasty goodness.   Note, some bowls have more meat and toppings than others.

Gyozas are also very good and appear to be made in restaurant as opposed to the frozen bought variety.  

Chicken wings were also very good however last time they came undercooked.  

I'll give that a pass as until that dish everything has been great.  

Very attentive service.

Will be back again.

If you're looking for the cliched Mexican restaurant with the Mariachis and frozen cocktails/margaritas then this place is for you.

Personally I prefer contemporary Mexican cuisine with good premium margaritas (not that Jose Cuervo/Sauza stuff).

Unfortunately, the food and service at Casa De Mateo were unremarkable as was the margarita.  

I don't know if we have much choice locally (would love to hear any suggestions), but I still think you need to head down south below the 49th parallel to find really good margaritas and Mexican food.

Bleh.  Uninspired.  

Went to dine at Mechant Boeuf yesterday during the Happening Gourmand.  
Chose the goat cheese appy, Mechant Burger, and chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Nothing particularly good or bad.  
I would rate the food comparable to typical bar food.  

The bar is clearly the draw here ... might return for beverages but not to dine again.

I don't know what the last reviewer is talking about.

I'm Asian and lived in Vancouver most of my life so I would like to think I know a little about authentic Asian cuisine and this place is certainly not that.

"General Tao" and "authentic" don't belong in the same sentence together.  :P

Came here for lunch and tried the Pad Thai (not Chinese) and some fried beef dish.  
Food was edible, service thorough, but menu caters to a Western crowd.

Ate here last week during the Happening Gourmand.

The food came out very quickly ... maybe too quickly you know what i mean?

It's a funny thing when it comes to quick service .... there's a fine line between an efficient waiter and feeling like they're trying to rush you out the door and get their tip.

Unfortunately it felt like the latter.

The meal was affordable and decent however nothing outstanding.

I paid $48 for a gel manicure as well as a $14 tip for my technician, Simone. Unfortunately, my manicure fell apart within the first couple hours of getting it done. I decided to add gems, but they fell off my nails same day. Now my nails look tacky. I called back to ask if they can redo it. I was able to rebook with another technician. I also asked if it would cost anything, but the girl over the phone didn't know if I'd have to pay since it was a different technician. Also, I can see through some on the polish. Clearly, my gel manicure was not done properly. I decided to call back to cancel the reschedule appointment being that I do not have the time, and I don't want to pay for a mistake that is not mine.  I'm very disappointed. Your service is not even close to being worth $48.

I stayed here after seeing rooms for $6.00 on Expedia, I really was thinking the worst. I have to say I cant wait to go back, the rooms are small but they are perfect for one or two people. The air condition works great, yes you need that in Vegas. All the staff was always nice , the valet people were always very friendly too. My room had a good bath tub, old school. Only complaint and its not a complaint the water in the shower must come from a volcano, dam its hot, guess to wash off the germs from the night. Late at night there was some working girls out on Fremont street if that's what your looking for, must have been the Tuesday night special because there were tons of them. Overall I will be back, good experience at the Golden Gate. Try the Dolly Parton Slots they are fun!

I recently filed bankruptcy and received a letter that they could finance me!. In fact I think they was the first out of like 75 I received. I called them and they said come out. What a joke. The first day I went we rode a golf cart to the back where all the dirty cars are and they kinda teased me showed me a really nice about a 2003 Camry with leather. I asked to drive it and I could only drive it down what looked like a residential neighborhood because he said the shop hadn't checked it out. They said they would work on the deal and they next day well they couldn't do it. They showed me a 2006 Civic that would be perfect, keep in mind 99k mile car, and the air condition was working but they would fix it, what a joke. Like $375 a month for 60 months and you can trade it in a year, yea right. Thank God I didn't buy here, Please shop around when you receive these letters. Try Camel back Ford they was the best and I wasn't treated like I have bad credit. The sales man was pretty cute in the Fast Loans Department but other than that what  a joke.

I recently filed Bankruptcy and received at least 50 flyers in the mail from Larry Miller Dealerships wanting to finance me. What a joke. I signed up online filling out application, I was called from a salesman at Larry Miller Fiat, come on down we can get you in a car, we own the bank, Prestige Financial, what a joke!. He looked online at all there dealerships looking for the RIGHT car, he found one. 2010 Chevrolet Cobalt, I have never been in jail but I have seen jail cell movies that the jail cell looked cleaner, yea it had new tires and low 60k miles but  it was nasty inside. Like $366 for 66months and you can trade it after making 12 payments, yea right who wants a 2010 Cobalt you still owe 10k on lol. Please do yourself a favor when you receive these flyers and look around. Camel back Ford was the best place I went to and didn't treat me like I had bad credit.

I am still fighting my nightmare aka case. I been very blessed and Victor was one of the biggest blessings of all bonding me out of jail. My family member is out of state she called at least 10 bail bonds places that was rude, wouldn't help her or wanted her to bring a vehicle and leave it for collateral. Keep in mind she's 2000 miles away. Victor from the start worked with her, was honest about the hole process. Victor sent his amazing coworker Katrina to have my paperwork filled out. Boom I was out of jail hell, first time in my life in jail scared to death, still scared. I go check in with Victor on Fridays it's more than a check in usually. He gives me hope when sometimes I don't have it. He helps me to believe everything is going to work out. He treats you like a friend not a criminal, yes if you mess up he's gonna get you like Ru Paul says dont fuck it up, you treat him like he treats you, you get the awesome blessed Dignity Bail Bonds experience. I truly recommend him to anyone and not just because he got me out of jail because he's fair, has a awesome energy about him, overall great business. Go Dignity Bail Bonds!!! Go Victor!!!

Looked like a bunch of goth skater cooks trying to serve some home style food. My friend ate with me and he wasn't very impressed either. I had a QT cup because QT ice tea is bomb and one of the skater workers said because of the liqueur license I had to throw it away. It was ok, I went, I probably wouldn't go back.

We then had the spicy prawn, black truffle duck and Asian greens with ginger. The flavour in each dish was just amazing. The banana peanut dessert was the perfect ending to the delicious meal.

Ate here based on a suggestion. Waitress was friendly but when asked what she recommends, she spoke really quickly and we didn't understand any of what she recommended. 

Food was very yummy but very small servings - I guess that's tapas for you! 

Cucumber Mist cocktail was great. 

Fantastic view. Best to request a window seat or even a table on the patio. Sat by the window and we weren't disappointed.

Posted some photos from the experience my wife and I had yesterday at Paramount - Heartland location, you be the judge. We were there at 5pm, it wasn't busy at all. The food served to us wasn't fresh, I am so disappointed and I felt cheated when I saw the condition of the food which was served to us. I am not a difficult customer and I don't create a scene either but since yesterday I can't forget the worst experience I have had and the upset stomach. There were pieces of chicken skin fat in my shawarma platter and the salad was stale, the fattoush salad we order didn't have the crispy chunks of fried pita it comes with. Small portions with lots of stale fries , is this what you call fine foods?! The service was extremely slow, we had to look for someone to give us more pita bread. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, we clearly mentioned our table number to the server and she ended up serving the bread at another table. I spent most of time time scavenge through our order and left with plates full of old food which seemed microwaved. $45 for two platters and fattoush salad.

Do not order to-go from this place. I was told it would take 35-45 minutes for delivery, but after an hour I called to check on my order and was given a "sorry, he just headed out." Another half hour later I had to call and cancel my order because I could not wait anymore. I was out on hold 3 times. Poor service and it sounded as if the employees were clueless on what to do. I got no explanation as to why it took so long. Disappointed.

My boyfriend first started coming here when he injured himself during a workout and has been coming for months! He absolutely loves Dr. Reed! Reed has truly helped his back and he's far better than from before. (He used to sleep on a tennis ball due to discomfort) 

He then referred my roommate who works an office job. The slouching and being hunched over quite often has taken a toll on him so he came in and loved Reed as well! (He had gone to a different chiro prior and made the switch). 

I caved and stopped in myself. I am a server and carry heavy items and trays so my lower and mid back are always aching. I'm still just 20 but ever since coming here I've felt a huge difference in my whole body! I'm definitely happy with where these sessions are going. I'm aware of my posture at all times and that has helped me breathe better and digest better. Reed is very attentive to how your body works and since he's suggested better sleeping positions for me, my nights have gotten significantly better. 

Grace up front is a gem I can't forget about! She's very sweet and kind, always picking up on conversations, and just brightens up my afternoons! 

Everyone is great so even if you stop in just to check it out or ask questions, totally worth it!

I've been to two other Enterprises and I have to say, this location has been the best! Everyone here is very friendly, especially Tyler. Exceptional service, made renting a car super easy for me, and was able to go through all the paper work and whatnot in no time! I work in customer service myself, dealing with people everyday, so I really appreciate workers like him who not only make your experience better, but remember you and pick up conversations from where you left off. 

Definitely recommend this location if you're in Tempe / Mesa! All of the associates are wonderful, but if you can, speak to Tyler, he will take care of you no problem!

I love this place! Great flavor in all the dishes I've tried, my all time fave is the Chinese Lettuce Wraps! Lunch is definitely the best time to go, excellent portions and affordable prices. I plan on working my way down the entire lunch menu! Walking in, the lighting is beautiful and natural because of the big windows, it's super open space, high ceilings, cute decor, this place is modern and lovely. All the servers have been genuine and kind also! 

Highly recommend for a quick bite, or even a nice family friends dinner :)

I've struggled with mild-severe acne since high school and finally at 22, I've found peace. I had been seeing another dermatologist and esthetician in ahwatukee, but needed to search for a more natural and friendly office. I love how cozy the space is when you walk in and how family-oriented the workers are. 

My first visit was just a quick exam with suggestions of switching out chemical-filled products. I was even gifted a sample for my inflamed cystic acne. The Green Tea Gel Cleanser, I believe. I like it for when I don't wear make up and just need a quick clean at the end of the night. 

On my second visit, I had the pleasure of getting a personalized facial from Diana, who I adore! She's super informative and really taught me a lot about how my diet would affect my break outs. I kid you not, after cutting down on gluten (was hard since I work at a brewery) and dairy like Diana recommended, my skin smoothed out almost instantly. Anyways, after my rejuvenating, relaxing, and gentle facial, I was gifted another sample. The Clove Gel! Immediately after using this gel, my redness calmed down, my oils weren't as crazy, and I definitely saw improvements on my face. It makes my face feel super smooth and cool. 

I just went in for my third visit, only to purchase that Clove Gel she gave me a sample of. I can't wait to see Diana again so I can ask her about what products I should use next since my acne is almost gone and I only have scars and hyper-pigmentation. 

I truly appreciate how friendly the team is and how helpful they are with the products they carry. They have a line exclusive to them I think, and it's mostly natural/organic, which I love! I'm actually bringing three of my friends in for facials/check-ups because I like this practice so much!

I love this salon, it will be my new go-to for touch ups, if i need a special do, or just a regular trim! Bree, was so helpful since I hadn't gone to a salon in such a long time. She was able to quickly see what it was that my hair needed and how to frame my face correctly, which I had trouble with. She was able to transform my thick and broken hair into a chic and cute look with flexible layers and volume! 
HIGHLY recommend this place!

I love this place! Front desk is always friendly and never hesitate to start up a nice conversation. Rachel is an absolute saint! She's helped me so much by ridding bad make up in my collection, recommending better regimens and routines for my mild acne, and teaching me new things about my own skin! It's a bonus that they remember you and your concerns from the last visits!

My absolute favorite spot for ramen, fried appetizers, and even sushi rolls. I love that they offer a little bit of everything because sometimes that's what I want. Its such a clean and neat place with the friendliest servers and chefs. Alan, who is a chef there is personable and knows how to take care of his guests. Every visit is like I'm seeing a friend while enjoying his creations. 

My boyfriend loves the tonkatsu ramen there and I can't get enough of their chicken or pork katsu. So thin and crispy, paired with fluffy white rice is heaven. Try the croquettes for a solid snack or  octopus appetizer if you dare! Go with friends to order a bit of everything and eat family style or go on your lunch break for a quick and heart meal. It's great for all!

This is my go-to for any meal honestly. I love how quick and easy everything is. The service can be strange to those who aren't used to Asian owned establishments. But I enjoy that there's no forced conversations and unnecessary check ups on us while we eat. So, service is straight to the point and quick! 
The food though, is never disappointing for me. I choose to eat here for hang overs, for a quick lunch, and sometimes even just a quick spring roll snack. 
I highly recommend! It's just delicious food with good service and the owner will always remember your face :)

I just want to start off by saying, this store is my favorite place to grocery shop. All the cashiers are friendly and always give cold water bottles when it's extra hot out and sometimes even little yogurt treats. I come here for 90% of my groceries. Amazing!!

They sell basic produce and in an environmentally friendly fashion. Nothing is ever overstocked (which goes to waste) to look glamorous like at big grocery stores, but there's just enough fresh goods for daily shoppers. 

I can find the best meats here! I only come here for my Korean BBQ meats, stew meats, and anything else I need for soups or broths. It's always looking fresh and for items that are about to go bad, instead of throwing it out, they put them out at a discounted price. 

I also love the packaged lunches they make everyday. There's beef or fish cake kimbap, kimchi stew, pan-fried fish, eel, a bunch of side dishes by the check-out station, and even fresh sweets like mochi and pastries.

My girl friend and I went in around 1pm for two pedicures and two gel manicures and were out of there by 2:10pm! I was greeted right away and directed to the nail polishes and massage chair immediately after. Everything was amazing! The prices are reasonable and I felt that that service matched, if not more. The deluxe pedicure was excellent. Hot stones, towels, and sugar scrub!! Super relaxing. The best part was I never felt awkward and the workers were extremely friendly. 

Will be back again!

I just wanna say, THANK YOU KEVIN. This beautiful human being showed me the difference between amazing and not so amazing piercers. I made the mistake of falling for a $30 deal at Next Level Piercing & Tattoos and was stuck with a giant retainer that literally hit my upper lip when I talked. 

Kevin was able to swiftly and painlessly switch out the jewelry for me. It wasn't a big process for him or anything but I just really appreciate how gentle he was with my bruised septum. I didn't even feel him take out the old retainer to put in the new jewelry! 

For future piercings, I will be back. Also, if you are thinking of getting anything done, do it here. You get a gorgeous selection of jewelry as well as skilled hands doing the job.

Love, love, love this place. Everything from how family oriented it is to the quick and easy combos they offer. Nothing makes it feel more authentic than the homey atmosphere and friendly workers that have been around forever. Tom, the owner, always remembers everyone's names and picks up conversations right where you left off. 

Pricing is extremely affordable and the food is delicious! I love the Dan Dan noodles the most. Such wonderful flavors and always have enough for the next day. 

The only con I've experienced is the lack of service sometimes. However, keep in mind, traditional Asian food service is extremely casual and they try not to bother you while you eat. 

If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive bite of Chinese, I'd stop by!

Hands down, best sushi place I've ever been to. Customer service is always a must have with me and this place is all about it! Have had every server (been there that much) and they are all friendly, know the menu, and recommend the best specials! The sushi is amazing, don't be afraid to ask what's good that day because the chefs know what's up!! Atmosphere is never a let down. You find yourself conversing with the boss in no time, which makes you feel really welcome :)

Been here with different friends more than twice now and will be returning. Service is always great, Kevin is our favorite server! He's kind and attentive, but most importantly, he's able to help me decide on which dish I want to try :) 

Kimchi fried rice is a must try classic!
Spicy rice cakes with ramen and meats is a little bland but I can tell the flavors are there :) 
Spicy squid salad is delicious as well as the bulgogi rice! 

Get it all!!

Nothing that I don't like about this place! Love that the establishment is clean (tables, booths, utensils, glassware), and the interior is decorated to give a nice, soothing atmosphere. Perfect lunch portions for an affordable price. Service is quick and usually at lunch they don't talk/bother you much, which I enjoy. Sushi rolls are outstanding, love the way they're held together and the texture of the rice! I always come here for an easy meal :)

Despite being 22, I've got quite a long history with dentists. I grew up without proper dental visits, resulting in 4 decayed molars. 

At 18, I took myself to one of those chain dental offices and paid over $1500 for two root canals. I was never given an explanation as to what a root canal was or that I'd need to pay for crowns separately. So, I got the roots taken care of but due to insufficient funds (because I'm 18!) I couldn't afford crowns to keep them secure. 

From 19-21, I hopped from local dentists to dental schools, and even Mexico to save money on the treatments (crowns, bone grafts). I couldn't pull through with most places because they were discomforting and too business-like. 

Finally I found this place on yelp and after the consultation with Dr. Walker, I knew I could trust his work. He thoroughly went over my teeth, proposed a treatment plan, and even broke it down into separate operations to help lessen the financial stress. Most dental places feel fancy and the work they suggest never seems necessary (like they just want my money), but here, I understood the importance of each extraction and surgery because Dr. Walker took the time to explain things. 

In the past few months we extracted a tooth, did a bone graft, and a root canal retreatment. All were extremely terrifying at first, but I trusted him. Everything went smoothly and even when the retreatment got complicated Dr. Walker comforted me by staying positive and updating me throughout the procedure. (The scariest thing is hearing someone say "oh no" without a follow-up) To be honest, I was trying to stay awake so I could keep my mouth open; it was that easy-going in the room. 

I genuinely appreciate the work he's done and can't say enough about how great my endo experience was. 

*the receptionists and assistants are always a pleasure as well. It's pretty family-oriented in there so they tend to remember you!

Terrible customer service. Terrible. I took my Honda truck to this location for an oil change. When I said to Carlos, the manager on duty, that the $79 he quoted me seemed much higher than the dealer, he went to tell me in a rude way that "we make our money changing oil and the dealer makes their money selling cars". He then walked away. 

As rude as it gets. No clue how to treat a customer. 

I ended up getting my truck serviced at a local Honda dealership. Oil change plus tires rotated in 45 minutes for $66 including tax. 

Stay away from this jiffy lube location.

I just had the best hair experience with Katie.  She was attentive, honest, and very easy to talk to.  I moved to Arizona 5 years ago and kept getting my hair done by sub-par stylists.  More recently, I had a hair disaster (at an unnamed salon) that Katie fixed for me and I couldn't be happier.  She asked me to scheduled a consultation and she explained exactly what she could do.  She did not make false promises.  She was honest and I appreciate that. I love my hair and although this Dolce is a bit out of my way, I will be a regular client.

Delicious food that is prepared quickly. We were visiting Charlotte from the DC area and needed something fast before heading to the airport to catch our flight. Right after we ordered I filled up my cup with some freshly brewed ice tea (sweet and unsweet) and by the time I walked outside to claim a table the food was ready. Fortunately they don't have that Gold Peak ( aka gold piss) crap that a lot of restaurants have in Maryland. I love brewed tea.... So we ate outside at one of the tables. There are only about 3-4 tables out front so most people just grab their food and go. Overall, a great place for gyros that is affordable and ready in a snap. I suspect other items on the menu are also tasty but I can only comment on what I ate and it was delicious!

Review is based primarily on the beer and atmosphere. This truly is one of the best places to enjoy quality beer in a really impressive outdoor environment within the city limits. I stuck to a liquid diet for the evening as consumption of fine beer was my #1 objective. I appreciate that OMB brews according to the 1516 Bavarian Law of Purity....Unfortunately, a thunderstorm came through so we went inside and the facility inside is also quite nice. Overall, a great place to enjoy quality beer.

I can't recommend Haulin' Goats enough.  The day before the goats came out, Heather stopped by and we showed her the area we want the goats to weed.  It was very easy and took very little time.  The next day the goats came over and went to work.  

The area the goats were weeding for us was overgrown with poison ivy, making it impossible for us to get in and weed ourselves.  The goats absolutely tore through the poison ivy.  In fact, the poison ivy seemed to be there favorite, because they ate it first.  Because it was a big area that was very overgrown, it took a 2-3 days, but the goats absolutely cleared everything out.  

The goats can't clear everything out like weed killer, but the most they left were a few small weeds sticking a few inches out of the ground.  We were very surprised how well it worked.  

Also, the area where the goats were focused was along the bank of a lake and we weren't sure how the goats would do, because a lot of the poison ivy was very close to the water.  But, the goats took care of everything.  

We were blown away with how well the goats worked out.  If you're looking for a non-chemical method to get rid of poison ivy/weeds, I can't recommend Haulin' Goats enough.  The process was easy and pain free and the kids in the neighborhood loved coming over to see the goats.

I came into town a week ago and was told to check this place out. Doing so I was very pleasantly surprised as they did not have the usual bad attitude of some gun shops that I have been to. ( I.E. "You do not know what the hell you are talking about". Or "Either buy something or get the F**k out of here")
 Instead they were very friendly and professional  to me and my wife. So I bought some parts for one of my guns and had them shipped to the Peoples Republic  of California. Today they showed up today in a flawless manner. So Well Done to all Hands. It was a very refreshing experience!

My car wasn't even turn on in my parking lot, i thought it might be dead battery. After i googled on yelp i found this guy with a nice tittle ( save money towing) i thought to myself this can be a good choice. I called him and he said it cost 75$ to tow my car, and i said ok. He didn't show up at the time he gave me and it was like two hours later. 
He was so on rush at the time i was talking to mechanic and he kept saying "you killing me man" every single minute, as if he is doing a favor to me and it's all free. He ask me for 5$ more after i said i pay by debit card. This is exactly what i experience with him. i give him one star cuz i think he needs to be patient and respect the customer. He is not running a hotel he should know that his customer is in rough situation and he should help customer instead of making more stress on him or her.

Seriously amazing service! Gerry was so helpful and accommodating. He responded to my emails within the hour. 

Their price for rental cars is insanely good. 

I rented from here twice in the past couple of weeks and each time I had a cute little Mazda 2, perfect for tricky Toronto traffic. 

Convenient central location in Kensington Market.

If I need to rent a car in the future it will be from here for sure.

Service was a bit slow.. We waited for a little bit to be seated.. We sit near the open window which was really nice.. Ordered drinks that took a while to get.. Our waitress didnt introduce herself which I can't stand when you have to ask for it.. The food was great though! Burgers were delicious.. Very well seasoned! Inside the restaurant wasn't nothing too special.. The food was worth the wait!

Kindercare is an awesoms daycare.. The secured building.. The staff loves their students.. They are all around great.. A cook for breakfast and lunch.. I never had no issues with this daycare at all..However.. You get what you pay for.. They charge an inital enrollment fee and a weekly fee.. This is even on top of any childcare assistance you may or may not get. Also, they charge expensively for summer camp programs. Overall, awesome daycare but if you want to pay out some money then it's a money pit! I only gave it a 4 star and not a 5 because I did not expect all these expenses.

The pork with rice was tasty but I got it as take out last time and it was my first time there. The second time was quite disappointed, it was so loud inside, barely heard my frd talking plus the wait time. I would hv gone sth better. Just the Pad Thai is pretty disappointing, from what I remember I just remembered nothing but the loudness and the long wait

Came in looking for new bedroom furniture and was quite surprised at the prices. Very expensive for a thrift store. They did have a lot of really near collectible antiques, but they were way out of my price range. I will probably come back again if I am in this part of town but I won't be going out of my way to make a stop here.

I must admit, I was really nervous coming here for the first time and not really knowing what to expect. The facility was clean and inviting and my waxer, Billie (a female), was wonderful. She cut right to the chase and had me undress and hop on on the table the moment I got in to the wax room. She was friendly, personable and did a great job explaining the process and what she was going to do. It wasn't nearly as painful as I thought it was going to be and I liked it enough to schedule another appointment when I checked out. The prices are reasonable and I look forward to coming back in 3 weeks.

So the first time i eat here i got just a cheese burger as i normally  dont care for these "designer burgers" and the bill came to 19.00 for a burger and taters ,  drink
Which they said the tater where famous lol tasted like macain frozen  tater to me. The cheese burger was meh so i said I would never go back for a 20 dollar burger that was meh. Then a friend at work told me to try the thanksgiving day burger. A well seasoned turkey sandwiched between STUFFING and MASHED SWEET PATATOES AND CRANBERRY JELLY  amazing also again almost 20 bucks but worth every bite . But due to price of a regular  cheese burger  i will only come back for the "Thanksgiving day"  if you are going to eat here you better have deep pockets like a movie star

Have stayed here on numerous occasions and the quailty continually declines.  I was stuck on the main level with a parking lot view, which was very depressing.  The room was old and quite dated.  I requested that I be moved, but I received the "we're overbooked and this is all we have left" speech.  I will consider other hotels in the area before this one in the future.  It just isn't the same place and this is post renovation.  Before check out on my last day, no cold water, only hot.  Told the staff upon check out and received 10% off my last night's rate.  Whoopie!

Went to this place on Monday night football. Walking in looked like a nice place to cheer and get your grub on !! I was there for the happy Hour so I ask the waitress about sitting on the comfy chairs up front. Her reply was it's not a 1st come , 1st served and we would have to charge your party of 5 a 150$ I was like just to sit or is that how much food and drink we needed to order . Her reply was " just to sit. " we started laughing , not high rollers at all. We gently walked ourselves over to the bar stools . Hahahaha.                                                    Over all experience was cool, not a bad seat In the house . Good choices for beers if that's your thing. The Yard was a good look, we ordered up all the appetizers and felt the jack Daniels wings were a hit too. Will be looking for another sports bar upon returning to Vegas . Oh yea our bill came to 155$ and all I could do is laugh because the comfy sofa couches didn't even fill up.

Can be overwhelming your 1st time but you can sample any of them that catches your eye. It's one of those places where you go and feel good about trying the different flavors. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable of the product. Hey and if you want to get a little alcohol in your healthy drink that's an option too.

Got here early on football Sunday 7:30am as I wanted to start the day off right. Heard this was the best buffet in town besides Bally's hotel . So upon entering the buffet there was no line or wait. Hostess was nice giving us the once around tour because it was our 1st time. The food looked incredible and my mouth was salivating to try it all. I'm the type of person that my first go round is to try it phase then the next time , and the next time I Attack !! Steak and eggs were bomb , omelet was on hit too. Red velvet pancakes yum . Had problems with the country fried potatoes but the onion rings made up for it.                                             Not a big fan of the champagne and orange juice so I instead opted to order the bottomless beer  Yeee !! Sea food was incredible and made sure I did damaged there also. Made a pit stop for the food truck type tacos . Brought it home with the desserts ! Well rounded buffet really , really enjoyed it . Some yelpers I see complained about $$ it's well wort it !! Will come back !!

Just stayed at this lovely hotel !! The reason for 4stars is that they need to tell you it is back off the strip and a hike to get to any of the other hotels beside the Bellagio Hotel. It was bad jus getting around and trying to navigate a way out of there period. Now to the good part , the rooms are spectacular because there all suites ( with a door bell  ) Beautiful view of the strip and water show ( if your so lucky to get panoramic view). We were lucky !! Good service friendly staff . If you want to relax and not have the hustle and bustle of the strip it is recommended . Also remember to bring up the groceries for the full kitchen .

Not impressed at all, actually disappointed in the place . Pricey and lacking burger !! After ordering the double bacon burger and milk shake , mouth was waiting for explosion . Total flop after opening up the bag to see this small ass burger. Needless to say this place was a dud to me IMO . Oh yea the shake was also a bust for me . Never to return !!

I was really excited to visit this place because of its funky look and DDD. But it was a total let down. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it just us and like a couple of other tables so they were not busy at all and the service was so incredibly slow and bad. Our appetizer and the kids meal we ordered came out pretty fast but then we literally waited for like 30 minutes for our food which we learned later was just sitting under the heat lamps for like 15 minutes. There were like 3 servers hanging around not busy while our food just sat there. And our server was hanging out at a table sitting with them for like 10 minutes when our food was just sitting there. Finally we got up and asked where our food was and it still took another 5 or so minutes for someone to bring it. The tacos were soggy by this time and not good. Aside from the bad service the food was just a total let down. The kids meal was gross and our tacos were soggy and it seems the oil was old because everything fried had a bad taste to it. This was a bummer because this was a place we were excited to visit and we left not even enjoying or completing our meal.

Me and a group of friends went to this place one night when they had live music. We had a very bad experiance and ended up leaving because of the rude service. We were a small group and we are obviously different looking than the crowd in the restaurant. The servers at the bar where very rude and no one offered to take our order or seat us. Then there was an open booth near the front and we asked to sit at that table and one of the servers told us that it was taken even though no one was sitting there. Like 10 minutes later a white couple came in and they offered the booth to them. We finally realized that there was a back room with empty tables and we went and seated ourselves and literally waited for 15 minutes before anyone even walked over to our table to ask for our drinks. They saw us seat ourselves which is why we finally got the hint that we were not welcome and got up and left. I think unless your a local in the neighborhood I would not visit this place. Very rude and unwelcoming atmosphere.

The clinic had a friendly  atmosphere.  I found the staff extremely helpful and courteous.  My doctor, Dr. Mostafa Sheta, was very knowledgeable and professional. To top it all, they gave me samples of some of my medications. 
I have nothing but praises for this health center, go check it out!!!

Right away she was so sweet and and treated me like a personal friend. I have no idea how, but she managed to work with what little brows I had and made them look amazing!! She is so precise and really knows what she's doing. I read all her reviews on yelp before deciding to go here and i'm so glad I did. I'm going to recommend her to everyone!!

I gave this hotel 2 stars because I did not see any mice, roaches or bed bugs in my room.

The key to staying at this hotel is have your paperwork in order if you don't they will double charge you....that's just the way it is. I booked this hotel through priceline made sure not to give my credit card to the hotel.

Do not give these people your credit card. 

I wanted an early check-in but they wanted to charge me an additional $14.95 resort fee for checking in before 11am. The resort fee is an additional $14.95 per night. I waited until 11am to check in.

The resort fee is for internet service in your room supposedly...I believe it's just a way for the hotel to make more money.

When I did check in the woman at the front desk tried to charge me for 5 night resort fee when I only paid for 4 nights through price line. I had to correct her by showing her my price line paperwork.

I used cash for $100 refundable incidental deposit and the 3 night resort fee which was slightly under $60.

They tried to put me in a handicapped room (don't know why) but I requested a regular room instead.

During check in if you don't correct these people early they will double charge you or give you a terrible room. I still ended up with a really bad room.

The room I had was in the basement the window view was an outside wall. The bathtub was clogged with hair an green slimy stuff. I tried to pour bleach in it to unclog it but that did not work. The bathroom sink had hair in it. The carpet looked old dingy and dirty.

The entire room reeked of cigarette smoke.

The buffet was bad.....for some reason it looked like the food had been sitting out all day without being stirred or freshened up or replace and it was not cheap.  Dinner cost $12. 

I didn't complain to management about my experience at the hotel I didn't think they would do anything about it......according to the other reviews I read.

It's a cheap ran down smelly hotel.....at least I wasn't double charged. It's not the maid fault that the rooms are ran down.

Food is so good! They have a new menu out with new pasta dishes and pizza's. Service is great they deliver also. Their food is like having a restaurant like olive garden deliver to you. The average delivery time for them is about 35 minutes pick up is 12 minutes.

I go there probably 2 or 3 * a week for the last year and nothing's really changed. Monday night is the best night to go beer is 2 dollars and mixed drinks are 2.50. Other than Monday they are very expensive for the location and the service you receive. They have 1 or 2 great bartenders and the rest are either drunk on the job or too busy caring on conversations with their friends to get you a beer. They do have a great setup for watching sports and a lot of space. Food is pretty decent too and fairly priced. To be a mom and pops bar it's pretty decent. On Monday night thats the night to go good crowd too

If I could leave stars blank I would!!!! This place was gross, don't get me wrong great server n food was good for bar food. But after finding a fruit fly in a beer I was grossed out. I asked for the beer to be removed from my tab, the manager would not allow it. she made us pay for it!!! I don't complain much as my perffesion is a general manager in the food industry. We even killed two more at our table before she came to speak to us. Her excuse was that it's the end of summer and this happens. TODAY IS DECEMBER 5TH in Ohio.  never been so offended in intellegence and sheer customer service. Will never go back. They gave me a cup of bugs and told me to deal with it wow.

This place is great all beer and mixed drinks are only 2 dollars. Inside the place is huge and every Friday and Saturday they are packed. They play good music and the servers are really fast. Only problem I have and I warn you be careful if you pay with your credit card they make mistakes sometimes and overcharge. The other night my tab was 18 dollars but the next day when I check my bank account there were 2 charges from them. Other than that great place to hang out friendly people.

Me and my 5 year old son stopped at this place for lunch. First time we have ever been there. I walk in immediately start looking at the menu on the wall. Young lady asked me what I liked was very helpful. I brought two corn beef sandwiches. I noticed that they had chairs where you can sit down, so me and my son sat down and waited on our food. When we received the food I figured hey let's just stay here and eat. I started to pull my food out to give my son his sandwich and a rude Nigerian or Jamaican guy! So not politely told me how there's a sign by the door stating if its pick up you must leave. Then after embarrassing me in front of the entire restaurant he proceeded to yell out to a crew member put a bigger sign up.  I'm pretty shocked at the way the customer service in this restaurant. Most restaurants would have let something as simple as me deciding to change my mind from pick up to dine in GO. Especially when I spent about $20 on two sandwiches. pretty sure I won't ever go back there again. Besides they gave me a cold cornbeef sandwich. The Swiss cheese was not even melted, and the worst part about it all they don't put mustard on the sandwich. It could have been handled better. At least offer me the option to pay the Dollar to dine instead of just throwing me out.

His show in Paris Casino isn't worth its high price.  I paid for it and was disappointed from the moment that I walked into the venue, which was about the size of a large conference.  It's a cheap production and should have been priced in line with other hynotist shows.  Go see the video next the venue to see the show's highlights but don't expect more from his show.  You can expect boobs (on video), raunchy expletives, and simulated sex.

Like a few reviewers before, I'm somewhat conflicted on how I feel about this place. It's a great addition to those who live in the SW side of town, and they do have tasty pastries. I guess I'm biased because I had really high expectations on coming here from all the reviews, and it's been in my bookmarks for some time now. It's clean, and good compared to other asian pastry shops here in town, but if you ever travel outside of Vegas, you'll see that there are places that can execute the balance of flavors a little better. If I could give it 3.5, I would. We tried the coffee jelly, tiramisu, and green tea cream puff. They're all fine, but I didn't finish any of them, which is unusual for me. Even though I'm only giving it 3 stars for now, I do encourage you to give it a try to taste something different here in Vegas!

Quality of the sushi and food is good.  Didn't care much for the rice - it was a little hard.  The server was nice, but the place got really busy, and I felt like we waited around an awful lot.  Then later on the place smelled like something was burning. Not sure if I'd come back again for lunch, because if you have plans after - you won't make your schedule. Maybe ok for dinner?

It's funny, another yelper mentioned a great ambiance - but I guess it's not to my taste. I don't need silence when eating my ramen, but the music was way too loud. It's not really enjoyable when you server has to yell at you, and you have to yell back for them to hear you. To make matters worse, there was awkwardness at the communal table between the random couples (yes I've sat at communal tables before without issue). Thank goodness the food was better than I expected! If it was just based on food, I'd have given it 4/4.5 stars.

Enjoyable happy hour menu - it was a great way to try everything! We will be back again, and are getting the truffle edamame and black cod lettuce wrap again for sure :)
...so I made the cardinal mistake of posting before I finished my meal with dessert - the green tea tiramisu was amazing!  I'm a big fan of the milk tea ice cream too. Also, I was really impressed by how knowledgable our server was about the menu. She described everything perfectly. And you always have to appreciate it when the chef takes the time to come out of the kitchen to touch (greet) every table!

Dined there last night with friends, and while the food would definitely merit a 5 out of 5 stars, the service was probably one of the worst I've had. I understand they were very busy, and had a lot of things going on (large party in the other room), large parties in the main room - but there's a way to be busy, and gracious, without so much...tension? It was outright awkward. One person in the party didn't get their food, then another guest was accused of taking that dish - but I guess the server didn't punch in the order correctly for the ticket? It was just weird and uncomfortable. Another guest asked for help in getting drinks ordered, and no one would respond. I'd have typically given it 1 star, but hopefully I came here on an atypical night, and would like to give them the benefit of the doubt...or maybe suggest take-out to fellow yelpers? :)

After asking a friend of mine of where to go - I took my SUV down to Island Auto for an oil change and a check engine light that was on in my car.  The owner was really nice and honest - he didn't give me the run-around or try to overcharge me.  My car was repaired well, and for a much better price than what the dealership wanted to charge me.  Will be back again!

I have to be honest - I feel for the girls who had a poor experience at this David's Bridal...but I personally had the complete opposite experience.  I walked in one day on the spur of the moment with my fiancé, and made an appointment for later in the week (when he wouldn't be there).  When I arrived with my mom that morning, I was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk.  She got basic info from me on what I was looking for/budget/etc.  We then were led to the fitting area with my consultant, Tatiana.  After reviewing what I was looking for, she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on.  She took the time to ask me what I liked and didn't like from each of my dresses.  She was really sweet, professional, and genuine.  I told myself I wasn't going to buy a dress at my first appointment ever...but after 3 hours of trying on dresses, and trying my favorites back on a second time...I selected the gown of my dreams!  Not only was I never rushed, or ever made to feel like I was just a sale, my consultant Tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day.  She didn't try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget - she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful.  I ended up picking a dress that wasn't even what I had in mind - and I'm so glad for it!  The manager was also very polite and my mom and I were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us.  Yes the store had other brides, and yes there were others looking in the mirrors, and yes my consultant had to split her time...but it's such an exciting moment - I didn't realize how much time was passing, and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time, allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress.  As someone who also works in guest service, I can tell you Tatiana was great at multi-tasking - she gave me all the time I needed, and when she was working with me, she had her focus completely on me.  When I came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash, I had another great experience!  The lady at the desk this time also greeted me, and helped me find the headpieces (since I now wanted to try them on too)!  A consultant who was in the area was really kind, and he asked me if I needed help, and offered suggestions for what I was looking for.  When I finally made my way to the counter an pick up what I was actually there to get (my order), the manager and consultant there were both great...I am honestly blown away with it all, because I know it's rare to find that level of incredible service from a large chain.  Thank you, Tatiana, and the whole crew at this David's Bridal location!  I'll be sure to come back and get all my bridesmaid dresses / accessories very soon.  :)

My husband and I went there last night once we landed in las vegas, and I am happy we did. The slices are huge, and delicious. 

I did however, just get the basic cheese pizza.. kind of hard to screw up. But I have no complaints.

I will definitely be going back for another slice before I go home.

I went here for lunch today and it was great. I first walked by the place yesterday and couldn't stop thinking how good it probably is.. and turns out, I was correct.  

I got a strawberry margarita, guacamole,  and beef burrito.  The drink was strong,  guac was fresh, and the shredded beef burrito was so flavourful and filling. I was only able to eat about half of it. 

The service was awesome, it was happy hour and our waiter was very attentive with our drinks and the food was out within 15 mins. 

I would recommend this place to any Mexican food lovers. Mmmm.

Not only was my vehicle towed for no explicable reason, but attaining it was an extremely frustrating situation. Their website states that they are open DAILY from 8 am to 6:30 pm. Upon calling them, the rude woman on the telephone told me that they had indeed closed at 12 pm that day, but for an extra 40$ fee they could have a driver come release my vehicle to me in no less than 45 mins. Let's just say I've been waiting for over 2 hours, have called them several times and have still not gotten my vehicle. I'm extremely dissatisfied with their poor customer service and value for the time of others.

When we first arrived here, I thought this place would be a 5 star experience. Their bacon board and apple pie moonshine is out of this world.

After we had the bacon board, my husband and I took our server's suggestion and ordered their short ribs, which our server said were phenomenal. The short ribs come with fried coleslaw and we asked the server if we could sub asparagus and not get the fried coleslaw. So, the short ribs and asparagus come out. The short ribs were tough, small, and didn't have much flavor.

Then, when our bill came we were charged the full amount of the short ribs and coleslaw, and an additional $4 for our asparagus, which clearly shows that it's $4 on it's own. So, why did we have to pay full price to sub them and then not get a side that was supposed to come with our meal? So, we basically paid full price to not receive a side, and paid an extra four dollars for asparagus that would have been $4 regardless if it was subbed or not. 

We also experienced some issues splitting our bill and my husband and I were charged $30 more than we were supposed to be, even after telling our server that some of the items on our receipt weren't ours before she swiped our card. We were still overcharged and had to cancel one tab, but still be recharged for the other.

This place started out a wonderful experience but it seemed to get worse and worse as the night when on.

I will definitely go back, but only for the bacon board and moonshine, not the entrees.

Big 2 Toyota is one of the worst auto dealers in Arizona. If you want a new car, save yourself time and money by going to Power Toyota in Tempe. A year ago my boyfriend and I bought a brand new four runner from Big 2. They seemed nice when we were there but our payments were outrageous. A year later we decided we needed to trade our vehicle in because the payments were so high. We went to Power and they asked for our contract. We gave them all our paperwork Big 2 had given us and came to find out they never gave us a copy of the contract. They also told us our payments were so high because almost $8,000 of stuff was added on to our contract that we didn't need. They even added a life insurance policy for over 3,000...guess what...I was 21 at that time and my bf was 24. We had no idea that we had agreed to all that stuff and felt so stupid that we let them take advantage of us. Power Toyota pulled some major strings to help us because we had so much negative equity. Now, Big 2 owes us a lot of money in cancellation refunds and when I called to find out the status of our refund they said they'd call me back and never did. I even left a voicemail for the finance director, Brian, and never heard from him. My boyfriend went through the same thing. Today, after pulling some strings we finally got them to call us back and we find out they lost our paperwork. Horrible business full of deceitful, uncaring, unprofessional people. Toyota is a wonderful company and Big 2 completely hurts their image. Once I get my refund I will never do business with them again and tell all my friends and family to avoid them and go to Power where they are not looked at as a number but as a person.

The Great Pho King. If their name alone doesn't make your stomach dance with the joy and excitement of needing a Pho King fix, then you may have a serious problem. These days it can be tough to find unique food that is delicious and mouth-watering, but The Great Pho King's combination of Vietnamese and French food does just that. The best part about this place is that it doesn't matter where in the east valley you are, because they are portable and make stops all over. If you're used to boring foods and want something that will awaken your taste buds, 'Like' this place on Facebook and follow them to their next food stop. You won't be disappointed!! I pho king love The Great Pho King, and you will too!

My husband and I got married on the Terrace at Vegas Weddings on 8/29/15, and let me just tell you that it was one of the best experiences of our lives!!!!!! From the planning of the ceremony to the initial consultation at the venue to the actual ceremony to the photo viewing appointment after the ceremony...we were very, very happy with everything!!  Yvette Prather was our wedding coordinator and the first person we had contacted about booking our wedding there. She was very helpful with getting all of my questions answered and addressing all of the concerns that I had. Our package included a luxury sedan picking us up from our hotel and taking us to get our marriage license and then to the initial consultation at the venue. The driver of the luxury sedan was awesome and super sweet...she even gave us a card to congratulate us on the wedding. Very thoughtful!! Once we got to the venue to see it for the first time and have the consultation, we worked with Danielle. She was amazing!! She was very friendly and answered all of the questions that we had. We were also very happy with the Terrace!! I could see where it would be a little small for people who have a lot of guests. For our wedding, it was just my husband and I and the venue could not be more perfect. We had another luxury sedan driver that dropped us off for brunch after the consultation, and he was awesome too!! Our package also included a limo driver to take us to and from the ceremony, and that limo driver was amazing and very nice and friendly as well. A few minutes after we arrived for our ceremony, they brought us upstairs to wait in the bridal suite. We probably stayed in there for 30 minutes or so before our ceremony started. It was so nice that we got to stay in there before the ceremony because they do have other weddings going on at the same time and it made us feel special and like it was just our day. While we were waiting in the bridal suite, we met Reverend Garcia, who was very nice and sweet and just all around awesome. We also had several pictures taken in the bridal suite, and our photographer was amazing and did a wonderful job. Our ceremony went off without a hitch. We chose 2 songs to play when I walked down the aisle and then when we walked out and that made it very sentimental and special. We were also each able to recite our own vows, which made it even more personal. I had chosen to have the rose petals sprinkled down the aisle as well and was very happy with that decision as it turned out looking great. All in all, the venue was spectacular!! We had a 9:30 PM ceremony and it just turned out so lovely at that time because the gazebo is lit up and looks beautiful. We were very, very pleased with the venue!! We had some friends and family members who watched the online live streaming of our ceremony back home, and they said that it turned out great and they felt like they were able to join in on our special day. After the ceremony, we had more pictures taken (which pretty much all turned out awesome by the way), and then we checked out by giving them the address to mail our marriage certificate to. After the ceremony, our limo driver dropped us off at Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere, and he was just as kind as could be. We had our photo viewing appointment back at Vegas Weddings the morning after our ceremony. At that appointment (less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended), we were able to view a wedding slideshow of pictures that they had edited. We absolutely fell in love with the majority of the pictures that they had taken and ended up just purchasing our entire photo package at that time. The entire package is kind of pricy, but it is only a fraction of what we would have paid a photographer back home if we had had a "traditional" ceremony. They were able to give us a CD copy of our wedding slideshow, a DVD copy of our wedding video, and a CD copy of all of our wedding pictures in color, sepia, black and white, and thumbnail versions in hand at the end of that appointment...which means that we received all of that less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended. And the pictures were high quality and turned out so beautiful!! I was floored!! Especially when I hear of so many people complaining that they have not received their wedding photos a month or more after their wedding. I was very blown away that they had everything done and ready to go that quickly!! It was awesome!! And the quality of our wedding video was amazing too...it turned out so well!! Everyone that we worked with through Vegas Weddings was very friendly, helpful, and dedicated to making our wedding experience there as special for us as possible. We would recommend for anyone considering getting married in Vegas to get married at Vegas Weddings!!!! I will even be telling people who are engaged and not sure of what they want their wedding to be like yet to go to Vegas just to get married at Vegas Weddings!! It is an awesome place!!

We were recommended to Cashman through our wedding venue Emerald at Queensridge and it's no wonder they recommend them! They did our engagement photos, our Save the Dates, our video montage and our wedding day photos! The quality is simply stunning and they are so organized and everyone is just so sweet and professional! We mostly dealt with Allana who has become like a family friend and our wedding day photographers, Patrick and Jasmine are masters at their craft! They will be our go-to photography studio for life!!

Enchanted Florist did my December 8, 2013 wedding and I cannot say enough amazing things about not only the people working there, but the flowers, centerpieces, my bouquet and everything else included were stunning! They were amazing to work with, worked with my budget and I truly felt like I had the highest quality flowers! They truly saw the vision I wanted for my wedding and we're always available to help with any questions I had! I worked mostly with Kathryn for my payments/money stuff (amazing, always got back to me super fast) and Moe who did the setup/delivery of the flowers (so sweet and cool, felt like we had been friends forever) would highly recommend them for anything needing flowers in the Vegas area!

I cannot say enough amazing things about EAQ! We had our December 8, 2013 wedding here and from the first time we walked through the door to check out the venue to a year and a half later when said our "I Do's" nothing was left undone! They are so organized and efficient and know the wedding biz inside and out! Never once was I given a "I don't know" or a "we can't do that"...they will find the answer or a way no matter what and they do it always with a smile! They evening of my wedding, I felt like I was the only bride that had ever lived! They truly catered to my needs as well as my guests! I'm not sure what other venues offer or cost, but EAQ is worth every penny and I would do it all again!!

Mike did a wonderful job of thoroughly cleaning our stairs and four bedrooms! Our carpets looked like new and he did it all for an exceptionally reasonable price, and took the time to make sure any cleaner/water/dirt was completely gone from our carpets. If you need your carpets cleaned and and cleaned RIGHT, definitely call Triple J!

I'll spare you the long winded version. 

This restaurant is another product of a bad trend happening in Toronto. A mediocre restaurant that somehow gets great reviews from pretentious rags such as Toronto Life, Globe and Mail, etc. and the virulent contagion spreads to the minds of every subsequent reviewer and patron of said 'trendy' locale.

The food at this restaurant is just OK. It deserves no better than 2/5 stars. My partner and I eat out a lot and this might be the most overhyped restaurant we've tried in the past 24 months. Avoid.

I've been to this firehouse a few times recently and have been pretty pleased. The first few times the service has been a bit slow and lacking personality. However I took my wife with me this last visit and there was a bar tender with a broken foot who had us almost in tears from laughing so hard. There were a few older gentlemen a few seats down from us and she was joking with them and chatting about their family and her kids. This bar now seems to be more of a local place to hang out with good company rather than a typical sports bar that you just go to from time to time.  
If there were a better selection of craft beers the firehouse would have 5 stars easily!  Not even a decent IPA! The bartender was knowledgeable about beer however the bar had nothing good to offer. 
 We were  also introduced to the eli steak which was delicious! It is not on the menu, which makes no sense to us but we will be back for it!

All four of my daughters have played here for years. What a wonderful place for children to learn the game of soccer, learn commitment, learn teamwork and make endless amounts of new friends all while staying out of the elements in a climate controlled facility.  Alfredo and his staff have made us feel at home just as I see him do with many many other players and parents. I could not recommend this place enough. This is one place I feel my children are safe, having fun and being well cared for. Great job LV indoor. Great job Alfredo and your staff!!

Absolute worst experience with this place. Called to inquire about signing up my daughter for cheer or gymnastics class. After lengthy talk nice lady on phone recommended trying both since one was immediately after other. My wife took my daughter to the class while our other children at indoor soccer facility in same building. Instructor proceeded to belittle my daughter and wife by insinuating we were trying to get something for free by staying for second class.  I called in and advised them of this horrible situation and awful customer service. They DID NOT show compassion towards my issue or offer an apology for THEIR misunderstanding.I have been waiting for this company to show up on Yelp since this incident so that I can warn all of the unsuspecting people about this business. Beware. There are many other places that would love to have mine and your business. Steer clear. I have told countless dozens of people at the soccer facility of my experience as well.

Bought a chair for $400 for my home office from this location (as a gift to myself after a promotion).  I only spend about 1 day a week in the home office.  In 1.5 years, the synthetic leather in the chair totally fell apart.  Conveniently the warranty was only 1 year.  Structube personnel at this location and the head office refused to do anything even after repeated attempts at contacting them.  I would've expected a $400 chair to last at least ten years when used only once a week.  My previous $80 Staples chair lasted more than 8 years.

Structube: poor quality expensive furniture - although it is good looking - just don't expect it to last.

The food is amazing.  It's made with love.  I have tried almost all veggie and sea food dishes, and all absolutely amazing.

Caveat:  This is a family business.  The waiter, who's also the part owner and son of the cook, is a little weird - but he's actually a very nice guy - even though he may not seem like that at first brush.

You will always get good service and good food.  Ignore bad reviews based on service.  Enjoy :)

My most favourite Italian restuarant in the Vaughan area - and this area is full of Italian restaurant.  This is definitely not a typical Italian though - they have eastern twists in various dishes - which make it different in a great way.  The dishes are simply more flavourful.  I love the various pasta sauces and seasoning that use saffron.  The chicken pastas, steak pastas and seafood pastas are all awesome.  I am not a big steak person and have also heard that their steaks are not their strong point.  The two poutines are really great as well - which again also are different from regular poutines as they have hints of eastern flavours.  Awesome restaurant.  If you feel like having Italian, and want to try something different, this is definitely the place.

Bamiyan kebab has the best kebab options period.  Their various chicken and beef kebabs are all amazing.  It's really good to go with a bunch of people that you can try all the kebabs.  Been to all their locations and the meat is always fresh and tasty and consistently good.  Their quality and freshness is definitely higher than some of the other kebab options in the area.  Highly recommended.  It's also great for people who are New to different ethnic foods as this is relatively mild and you can add as much spice as you want on the side as needed.  :)

This is one of the best Indian restaurants in Brampton.  Everything always tastes super fresh and super tasty.  Quality is seriously lacking in a lot of Bramton Indian restaurants but that's not an issue here everything is high-quality.  I've tried almost all the vegetarian dishes as well as the fish tikka and fish pakora which are great.  The notable mentions are Achari paneer, chili paneer, fish tikka, gajar halwa, chat papri and Channa bhatura.   I've been going here for years - highly recommended :)

 I only wish they had halal chicken... so I could try the chicken dishes too.

My favourite Pakistani/Indian restaurant in GTA.  It's worth the drive to Mississauga even if you are in Ajax to come to this place.  They have the best Bihari Kabab, Peshawari Kabab, Karahi dishes and over all dishes I've tried (which is almost all of them) are super delicious and mouth watering.  It's a little small, so, it's always a good idea to call and make sure they are not busy before going - as it's quite popular and there is often a wait, especially on weekends.  That alone tells you that this is a great place :)

Have been using for the past few months instead of a company I had been using for 20 years because the old supplier just sells ice and did not return phone calls.  Great customer service.  You need ice right away, they try to handle right away.  Have storage box issues, they have immediate response, and usually an immediate solution.  Nice owners and accomodating pleasant delivery staff.  The ice is good too!

I unfortunately had similar a similar experience dealing with Leah that many of the other reviewers had. She came across wonderfully in my initial meeting with her but things quickly went downhill. She showed up at my wedding with a friend that she claimed was her second photographer but I don't think that friend took any pictures. My bridesmaids later told me that Leah was saying she didn't even want to be there...I paid her plenty of money to be there! I had to beg her for pictures after a few months and then got about 100 less than what was promised in the contract. Oh and no reception pictures! I don't have a single picture of me dancing with my husband or father. I asked her about this and she came up with excuse after excuse. Finally after 8 months and the threat of a lawsuit she admitted she didn't have any pictures from the reception. Leah has changed her company name so many times (I'm sure due the bad reviews) and it makes me so mad that she's still out there duping people. Please do not do business with her!

This is by far one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte based off of a couple of things. 1. The menu is very vast (almost too vast at points though) so you are bound to find something that suits your fancy. 2. The atmosphere is great - crowded but not too crowded, cool artwork on the walls, awesome bar with a giant salt water fish tank that spans the front wall, great outdoor seating by the fountain if that suits your fancy. 3. The food is YUM (the Bento box is my favorite as you get a little of everything, burger and sushi). 4. Love that when you enter the bathroom the background "music" is 3 voice where one is a sentence in English, one in Redneck and one in Japanese!  5. The service has always been top notch! 6. They have a combination burger and sushi option that is called Burgushi...novel ideal! 

Biggest draw back to me is that there is ALWAYS a wait and reservations are hard to come by unless you make then well in advance. Also, not a fan of no drink specials on the weekend.  

Overall, a fun place that I will continue to support.

Based on the reviews, I called Prima Sweet Shop. From the first conversation, she was very attentive and had good customer service. She gives great attention to detail to make sure you are satisfied with your order. The cake pops were prettier than I had imagined and they were absolutely delicious! The flavors that were ordered were vanilla, chocolate and red velvet. Everyone at the party were awed at how beautiful they were and enjoyed them even more when they ate them. The prices were very reasonable especially given the exceptional service and quality of the cake pops.

If I was rating on food alone, this would absolutely be 5 stars. 

We split the tofu tod for an appetizer. Panko coated and fried tofu with a crazy good sweet/spice dipping sauce. The tofu was well seasoned (its easy for fried things to go bland and this didn't) and had great texture. 

I had chicken pad thai. For $13 it was a generous portion. It came out piping hot and with a perfect level of spice (I requested on the mild side of medium, which isn't easy to nail).

I also tried my husband's massaman curry with chicken, sweet potato, and peanut. It was phenomenal, really rich from coconut milk with great flavor and heat. 

The service here wasn't bad, but they're definitely still learning. Our waitress mentioned that her brother opened the restaurant with his wife, and I'm happy to support a family business while they sort out the kinks. 

I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood and will routinely be slammed. Glad they offer take out!

Absolutely awful experience! If I could give no stars I would! This used to be my favorite nail salon, but since the new owners took over it has gone downhill. The customer service is horrible, and their services are shoddy at best. It took a total of 7 minutes for my pedicure from start to finish....i was cut twice on my cuticles, no callus treatment, and no massage. Apparently a pedicure now consists of soaking feet and painting nails only. I will be on the hunt for a new salon. Never coming back to this one!

I want to thank Impact Boot Camp for the help/support in my lifestyle changes.  I first tried Impact Boot Camp with a Groupon Special.  I knew I needed a change from my regular boring work outs at the gym.  It seemed like I was just going through the motions and not really seeing any success.  I liked the trial so much I ended up joining as a member.  There are 3 instructors, all with their own unique style which makes it a nice change and fun to work out.  The workouts are always different and challenging.  The best part to me is all I have to do is show up and give it my all, they have the workout all planned for me, no thinking involved of what do I have to do next.  After a few months of eating right and doing Impact Boot Camp for about 4 days a week I have lost 10.5 lbs and almost 6% body fat.  I'm very pleased with my results and look forward to continuing with Impact Boot Camp for even more improvements.

I went to the cafe/bar at the pool. They charged me 5$ for 4 onion rings. When I went to tell the front desk how disappointed I was, they took no ownership and said that the cafe was owned by someone else.  This cafe is ripping their members off. In addition, there was construction around the pool and it smelled like sewerage. I am disappointed and won't stay here again let alone buy their time share.

So, whenever you have a California gurl in a Mexican Restaurant, it has to be good.  My weary tummy has not had anything substantial all day, and having read the best of the best about the amazing La Tolteca, I decided to let me feet hit the street & check out this local flor in the rough.  Well, I have to say the reviews are all TRUTH.  
The green enchilada's were my choice as I've not ever been huge fan of the red sauce, in addition to a full range of all that one could feast your immediate appetite too, there is also fresh tortillas, candy, the bakery which is a temptation I did avoid (thank you P90X) and yes, I did say it, the temptation is the BAKERY,  the smells hit your nose before you even step in, yeast, sugar and spices, La Raza!  
Enjoy your time, don't rush, I wandered around and grabbed my favorite Fanta to connect the true flavors of home, Cali and my youth, thanks for the great time La Tolteca, and you'd better be sure that I'll be stopping in again with re-inforcements.   
Gracias & Happy Eating

Came for dinner and so unbelievably DISAPPOINTED!! Ordered Salmon which was jerky not a filet. Management deemed it to be edible and did nothing to rectify the situation. Miserable experience and would never recommend this restaurant!

It's not typical for my husband and I to try restaurants that have unusual name, not recommended by someone we know, nor because we're not the adventurous kind. Unless it's the only thing open and we're dying of hunger, maybe there's a slight chance. And if it weren't for the voucher we got, this restaurant ain't in our list to try when in Vegas, but it was a win-win, good opportunity to try since it's free dinner (with exceptions of: dessert, alcohol, tax, and gratuity)!

We were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well. 

I had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf & Turf Rodizio with "unlimited" meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater). 

Going back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. 

To end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.

Giving it two stars only because it was "free" dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!

EXCELLENT!!   The smoked salmon app was some of the best I have ever had! Very moist and cooked perfectly but with the right amount of smokey flavor. 

I have the filet and crab cake special with red mashed potatoes.   The filet was cooked perfect at med rare but the outside was seared to perfection.   The crab cake was also done perfectly with huge lumps of crab meat and little filler. Lastly, the mashed potatoes were thick and very flavorful. 

You know your dinner was great when the mashed potatoes are the worst thing on the plate !

Moving to CLT from PDX we were kinda excited to experience NoDa. We heard about this place and followed it in IG. Finally made out way to the area and it's def like a Portland vibe. Only they food missed the mark.  I got the fried chicken and waffles. Chicken was average and the waffle was bland and hard like a brick. I absolutely hated the syrup. 

Hush puppies were the best thing we ordered and were prob the best I've had since moving here 

Bacon jelly biscuit was also good but I wouldn't order it again 

Overall it's a fun spot with average food but we will go back  at some point to try it again.

Not good at all. I had the tuna tacos and my wife had the bacon, shrimp tacos. Both were tasteless. The rice was so dry it was inedible and the black beans were straight out of a can.  

The service was slow and non existent. We asked for lemons for water twice, refill of salsa that never came, another beer which also never came, and they allow smoking outside in the patio!!  No one wants to sit beside a cigarette during dinner. When we asked about the state law they said they allow people to smoke on the patio anyway. 

$45 for 2 crappy meals and a beer! We will not be back!

This was a weird dining experience.  The atmosphere is like a casual dining spot but the prices we high for the offerings. My wife and I spent almost $80 on 1 small app, 1 dessert and 2 entrees. No drinks.  Both entrees were wrong as if they ran out of food and were plating dishes on the fly with whatever they had. Nothing we ordered came out correct except the water. 

App:  Deviled eggs - good flavor in the filling but the whites were extremely rubbery. 

Entree 1 : Sea bass topped with crab / veg medley.  The Sea bass was good except it didn't come with anything that it was advertised on the menu. It came with fried mashed potatoes instead of the veggies , no crab meat, and had pesto sauce on it. I actually asked for the menu and pointed to what I thought I was getting. They brought my plate back and there was literally about 1/4 of an oz of crab meat. My wife and I just chuckled. 

Entree 2 : salmon and cheesy mashed. Salmon was great, but came with veggies instead of mashed.  Come to find out they ran out of mashed potatoes and we were stuck wth the veggies.  Who runs out of a main side dish at 6:30p?! 

Dessert: PB brownie cheesecake. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND CALORIES! Huge piece but bland and tasted kinda stale. Was also supposed to be topped with Pb cups. It wasn't. By this time we were fed up and just asked for the check.   We have NEVER not finished a dessert. We took it home and even the kids thought it was bad. 

Service: average at best. Everyone had super awkward personalities and it was painful to have a conversation. Our waitress seemed to be frustrated with everything. She would ask us how we are doing and then walk away while we were answering. We waited for silverware on 2 different occasions.   

To top it off the UPS driver wheels in 10 giant boxes right beside our table to unload in the kitchen.  

Like I said, it was a strange experience.

Really cool place and the kids enjoyed customizing their pops.  Prices aren't bad for a niche shop and the pops were very good. 

Only negative is that they are very messy. The drip trays could be a bit larger.

If you can wait an hour for your sandwich and do not mind it being cold then this is the place for you. Yes, you can receive faster service if you get there a few minutes before they open or a few minutes before they close but again no guarantee ... take your chances .... To be fair, I only waited 45 minutes and didn't get my food. They do happily refund your money though.

BEWARE OF EXAGGERATED CHARGES FOR THINGS IN THE ROOM THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE EVER EVEN TOUCHED

I stayed here for 1 night with a promotional rate of $85 plus tax in December 2009, and ended up paying $200 [basically their normal rate].  It wasn't even a full night, we checked in at like 8:30pm close to 9pm, and checked out earlier than 10am to make it to the famous Paris Brunch, before head on over to our Time Share.  That's like 13 hours, including sleep and walking the strip for 5 hours.

Don't get me wrong with this, it's a very beautiful and impressive property, but what happened after I left, can't be forgiven.  It's appalling, and I feel like I've been personally violated by the whole ordeal.

When my Credit Card Bill came, I noticed 2 charges from "Mandalay Bay".  I called to find out what the second charge was about and found out that I had apparently been charged over $100 for things from the private bar.   

I travel a lot, and know better than to touch anything in the overpriced bar, when there's the same exact stuff down stairs for much cheaper.  When I asked for a receipt of the itemized charges to be emailed to me.  I never received it.  I called twice to have it emailed, and twice they said they'd do it, and they wouldn't, so I disputed the charge through my Credit Card company.

30 days later, my Credit card was able to receive a copy of the itemized list and below were the items they pretty much made up out of thin air.  

--- half of this stuff, i don't even know what it is.  A "CD?"  what the heck.  What would i play it in?  Who plays a CD in Vegas?   I stayed in the room with brothers and sisters, what would I do with a "Love Kit".   

The only thing I could think of would be the personnel taking everything before tidying up the room, and blaming it on me....how would you dispute that?

4 bottles of Fiji water ($5)
1 Pringles Sour cream ($5)
2 Orange Juice ($4)
1 CD ($10)
1 Travel Kit ($15)
1 Love Kit ($30)
2 Cranberry Juice ($4)

In the end I couldn't do anything because they had my credit card on file for "incidental" charges. -- something that's industry standard, but to Arbitrarily charge for everything that was in the room, even if it wasn't used is absolutely NOT standard at all.  It's Shady!

I come to Vegas a lot and have stayed in a good handful of hotels on the strip and have never had any other Hotel chain do this.    From the budget friendly Imperial Palace, to even their very own newest 5 star, the Aria hotel, and not ONCE did any of them try this nonsense.  

For the many conferences and personal visits to Vegas I shall make, in the future, I will never, ever stay at the Mandalay or TheHotel again.  It's managed by Shady people.

This has been the worst experience I have ever received at a business establishment. So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member.. 

This is how the story goes:

My girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8/26 to watch the Mayweather/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get "unexpectedly" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. 

At this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. 

So we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. 

So then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.

It's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. 

So officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....
*This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*

NOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!

I'd like to add to Steven's abundance of great reviews!! Went well above and beyond to fix my water heater issues. He certainly is an asset to 5 star home services! I see one negative rating about replacing a water heater which I am about to do so let's hope it was not a common thing.

My girlfriend and I had an awesome time thanks to Chris and the guestlist feature. We signed up about a week early to go to the Palms clubs and then XS the next day. We received text messages the by 5pm each day with all the instructions needed for that particular day (ie, what time to come, etc.) I even called Chris and asked him for passes to the Mix (on Monday). He was very helpful and he rightly suggested that I should stay in XS since Mix is dead that day. At XS we got to skip the long GA line and we were in in 2 minutes.
The clubs were great of course and we had a super fun time. Thanks man!

I can not recommend this bookstore. I have been a book reader all my life. In fact, when I was growing up my parents had an independent bookstore. I am someone that is always buying books. Shortly before Christmas I drove to The Bookshop intending on buying books as Christmas Gifts. I do not smoke in my car and wait until I get somewhere to light up outside. While having my cigarette I was looking through the windows of "The Bookshop" prior to entering. The store was empty of customers as usual. A man inside saw me looking at the merchandise through the windows and in a most obnoxious voice came out and told me not to smoke in front of his store.  His arrogant manner and tone of voice implied that I was some sort of vagrant because I was a smoker. I told him "You just lost a customer." Every time I go past there to go to Dick's Hideaway to eat I never see anybody in his book store.  In fact, the other merchants in that strip plaza say they do not know how The Bookshop pays its rent as they never see anybody in there.  I might also add that while looking in the windows I noticed a sign inside the book store that said "Pets Welcome."  Like many Americans I am extremely allergic to dog and cat hair and do not think they should be allowed inside retail businesses unless they are seeing eye dogs.  The Bookshop owners are not considerate of potential customers.

Excellent, Excellent facility.  I have had several procedures done here and have been absolutely pleased with everything.  The overall experience from the front desk to Dr. Hall, to Evelyn the aesthetician has been wonderful.  Everyone is friendly, the facility is state of the art and the results are AMAZING.

I spend a lot of time in the sun and have experienced severe sun damage, primarily the ugly brown sun spots that connect and take over your skin!  After consultations regarding what I hoped to achieve I was given suggestions on what would work best for my skin.  This was done at first with Shannon.  She is terrific!  Very down to earth and funny. This really puts you at ease as you discuss procedures and financials; also important, given that these procedures are obvious luxuries for most people .  There is no high pressure sales and they always point you to promotions that might be coming up and how to get the most bang for your buck. 

Evelyn, the aesthetician is wonderful.  Very friendly, puts you at ease and really knows her business.   As I stated, I do have a lot of sun damage that has reared its ugly head in middle age. I will need to have more treatments done, but due to my outside activity I have to schedule it around times I will be inside a lot (summer).  After 3 treatments, there is a noticeable difference in my skin.  Many of the very prominent dark brown spots are completely gone off of my face and my chest area is almost completely clear!  It truly takes years off of your skin; which shouldn't be important but it is!

I have also had lipo on my previous  "baby" region. I'm of average height and weight but after children even diet and exercise couldn't get rid of that belly bump.  The results are amazing, no more pooch or "jiggly" area.  Do I look 20 again?  No, but that's not the purpose.  My interaction with Dr. Hall from the consultation to the actual procedure was excellent.  He gives you a realistic view of what you can achieve with the procedure. No false promises. He said that I had enough elasticity in my skin that it would shrink back after the procedure and he was absolutely correct.   He is kind and has an excellent bedside manner that is all but forgotten in today's world.  

I am very pleased with all the results and will be returning here for future laser resurfacing.  I recommend this facility to everyone.

We were looking for an older but reliable vehicle for our son.  We had looked at dealerships but we wanted to pay cash and most dealerships just don't carry older vehicles for a cash price with any type of warranty.   We told the salesperson what we were looking for and the price range and he suggested 2 vehicles that fit our needs. The salesperson was pleasant to work with and we were able to get the vehicle out the door for the price we needed and the paperwork process was very quick.  

Within the 15 day warranty period we did have an issue with the vehicle.  However, we contacted the dealership and worked with Patrick.  He was very helpful and the problem was corrected in an acceptable amount of time.  He returned calls quickly and worked with us to resolve the issue. 

Overall, we have been very pleased with the purchase.   Customer service is incredibly important; especially when issues arise.  This business met all of our expectations.

Dr. Guyette really is a Top Doc. An immediate family member recently had to have a skin cancer removed.  Everything was explained prior to the appointment (procedure, insurance, etc.). There are no long waits once you arrive for your appointment and everyone is friendly and courteous.  You are not rushed through appointments and he answers ALL of your questions without making you feel like you are on the clock.

Dr. Guyette is very caring and shows a great deal of compassion as he performs the procedure.  As noted previously, by other patients, he personally calls you to see how you are doing after surgery; this really is unheard of these days.  After receiving the test results from the biopsy Dr. Guyette's diagnosis was absolutely correct and enough tissue was removed so that we didn't have to go back to have additional work done. The cancer was right below the neck area so it was highly visible.  It's completely healed and unless you are really looking or know it was there the stiches are nearly UNDETECTABLE!   Beautiful work......for anyone who may be considering any other procedures.   

As a side note, we have also been to the Scottsdale office; both facilities are lovely. Our daughter had cystic acne when she was younger.  We originally had gone to a dermatologist and didn't like the treatment that had been prescribed; a prescription that had a lot of side effects we were not willing to risk.  Long story short, we took her to Dr. Guyette's Scottsdale office and through skin treatments, approximately 3 (laser) and using the Obaji line of products her skin completely cleared!  It's been almost 9 years, she continues to use the skin regimen they suggested and her skin has remained cystic acne free.  She did have some slight scarring from the acne but thanks to the IPL treatments it really is minimal and undetectable with very little make up.

We never hesitate to recommend either facility.

This place is clean and sanitary from what I saw; however, customer service is also very important and the interactions that I experienced was not great.  The lady that did my nails made several snips around my cuticles to the point where they are still stinging, one actually was bleeding. She was polite, but difficult to understand and not a great nail tech.  The man who did my friend's nails was beyond rude.  She needed fills and a color but after not completely understanding him and him acting like he didn't understand "fills and color" , he removed the "powder" he had put on and then because of what she needed done he told her needed to put the "powder" back on but there would be an extra charge because she had changed her mind and he had removed the "powder".  What?  We still have no idea what he was doing except charging extra.  She hadn't changed her mind he was making it more confusing than necessary.  All of this was being done with his eye rolling and heavy sighing like his customer was intruding on his day. This place is also much more expensive than other salons.   Fortunately, there are nail salons on every corner so it isn't necessary to spend hard earned money here.

Nothing too complicated, so I thought.  Tried to catch the shuttle from the west gate to the airport.  Concierge told me I could pick it up on the 20 minute mark or the 50 minute mark...Tried to get on the shuttle that showed up at 8:50.  The driver wouldn't let me on and told me I needed to schedule a pick up.  Called and they told me it was too short of notice so I took a cab.

We chose Stabella based off of a recommendation from a family friend. Unfortunately our experience wasn't everything we expected it to be. The main issues that we had was that our countertop was cut into two pieces to fit together, which sounded fine. But they cut a straight line instead of the typical angled line that you see. The straight line makes it so much easier to see. AND the worst part is that the color is so off its extremely obvious to see the line. We just feel that an effort to match the colors at the line should have been made. A few minor issues is that the countertops didn't fit the walls because our walls weren't straight. Which of course isn't Stabella's problem, but the sales rep initially told us that if this happened on sight the installers would just cut the wall a little to slide the counter tops in so everything would be flush with the wall. But when the installers got there they said they couldn't do that because the line (where the two pieces were cut and were supposed to meet) wouldn't be flush. We also decided not to get a backsplash because the sales rep talked us into how "new" and "modern" looking it would be. But then when we ran into the problems with the wall not being straight we wish we had just ordered the backsplash to hide the issues in the wall. Once again, that's not Stabella's fault that our wall wasn't straight but we just wish the sales rep had been a little more realistic instead of making everything seem like roses and daisies. In the end this left us feeling dissatisfied because we expected different things based on the initial sales pitch. Going back to the line where the two pieces met and one side was much darker than the other, they told us that the granite cutters were instructed to put the darker piece in be back. So what that told me is that Stabella was 100% aware of the drastic change in color while they were cutting our granite ... And the didn't care or even think that would bother us? They just sent it out to be installed at our house anyways. They offered to have an installer come out and apply a darkening agent to the lighter side..but why wasn't this done when the granite was still in their factory being cut? It would have saved everyone a lot of trouble and things would have been done right in the first place. We declined having them come back out to apply the darkening agent because we were worried it would end up looking worse and then we'd really be screwed. Let me add that after we notified them we were declining their offer to come out and darken the countertops, we NEVER heard from them again. We NEVER at any point in the process heard an apology that we weren't 100% satisfied, they never bothered to reassure us that their work would look great after they applied the darkening agent and they'd really like to make it right...nothing. Long story short, I would never recommend Stabella and we've even gone so far as to give their name to some acquaintances and say they're who we recommend you NOT use. Stabella might get away with taking our money and leaving us dissatisfied, but we'll do our best to keep people we know from using them.

Glass Doctor of Charlotte has replaced my mom's windshield, repair mine, and most recently replaced my husband's windshield. I've been super impressed with them. They're always on time (within the general time frame - you make an appointment for morning or afternoon), they're speedy (the repair of my crack took about 20 minutes, the windshield replacement took about an hour), and they're courteous. I will definitely be returning if I ever have any glass replacement needs.

What a wonderful experience! My dog had developed a serious rash on his skin and wasn't eating of drinking all of the sudden. My regular vet wasn't open on the weekends, so we called and got an appointment through someone else's cancelation. Thank goodness we did. Come to find out my dog needed antibiotics. We were in and out of the facility in 30 minutes. Dr. Sheehan was extremely knowledgeable and thoroughly explained everything that was going on with my dog. The vet tech and front desk staff were so friendly and made us feel welcome. We will definitely be going back for regular visits!

Went to order my bridesmaids dress after my bride had picked them out at the store. I'm 6' tall, so when my bride was at the store choosing a dress she specifically asked the sales lady if the dress could be ordered in extra long. The lady looked in the computer and told my bride that the dress could be ordered in extra long. Great! So I go to buy my dress, and the sales associate tells me that the dress is on sale for almost half the price. Great! I was ecstatic. So I pay for the dress, and as I'm walking out the door I return to ask the date that the dress will be in. The lady goes back in the computer system and says "whoops, I accidentally did your dress as a take off the rack instead of an order." So basically, if I would have walked out of the store my dress never would have been ordered. How upsetting is that! Well, as she look in the computer system to actually place the order, she finds that the dress is discontinued in extra long. So basically, she lied to my bride when she told her that the dress could be ordered in extra long. So I'm polite and say that it's fine and I'll just order the regular length and it will just be short on me - well then they tell me that I owe an additional $50, because the regular length dress was not on sale. I asked to speak to the manager to see if she would honor the discounted price, since that is what they told me that I would be owed. And the manager was extremely rude and would not honor that discounted price. Super bad customer service. First, they lied to my bride - the dress was not available in extra long. They lied to me - they didn't order the dress, and it never would have been caught if I didn't ask them to confirm the date that it would be in. And then they wouldn't honor the lower price of the discontinued dress. Honoring the regular length dress at the extra length dress's price would have made me feel a whole lot better about the situation. They basically said "sorry, it's not available." And that's all that they would do to remedy the situation. Very disappointed!!! I will be recommending to anybody that I know who is getting married to NOT use David's Bridal. If it weren't for my anal double checking personality, I never would have asked when my dress would be in, and the dress never would have been ordered. The wedding would have been here and I would have had no dress! If you are ordering from them, I would definitely suggest double, triple checking that your dress has been ordered. Otherwise, who knows if it will ever come in.

We called Air Source on a Thursday and were quickly able to schedule an appointment for the following Monday. Jeff arrived within the time frame that he said he would and he spent several hours looking at our unit. He found several problems and was even willing to put some temporary parts on to test it out to see if we could get by with a repair instead of a whole replacement. We finally determined our 8 year old system just needed to be replaced. We asked Jeff how much the first visit would be and he said no charge. Wow! Most places would charge hundreds of dollars for a service call visit. He ended up calling us that night with a final price for a new unit that he recommended and confirmed that everything he needed was in stock at his supply house. We scheduled the replacement for the following day. I was shocked he could get us in that fast. Once again, he arrived on time and spent several hours replacing our unit and also replacing some duct work that was too small. The final price was exactly what he quoted us with no extra surprises. Air Source will definitely be our go-to Heating and Cooling Business from now on! Would definitely recommend them!

The administrative staff at this location are incompetent. Because of a billing error to my insurance that they made, it has taken me months with my insurance to fix the error and get reimbursed fully for my glasses. If Monroe Eye Care Center's Staff would have been more competent at their jobs, they would have billed my visit correctly and I wouldn't have had any of these issues. I did enjoy my visit with the doctor, but the headache that their staff has caused me for the past several months will force me to never go back for another visit. I wouldn't recommend them for the simple reason that it could end up being very expensive for you out of pocket if they mess up your bill as well.

Time Warner Cable is just awful. I was due a refund of $29.13 for canceling my internet service half way through the month after I had already paid for the entire month. Well, that was the middle of January and now it's the middle of March and I still haven't received my refund. I have called Customer Service a handful of times and even posted on their Facebook wall. I can not get any resolution! They just keep telling me 1) someone will call me or 2) they're checking on it and they'll get back to me. I never hear anything back. I just want my refund. It's stealing if you keep money that isn't yours TWC! Until the day I die (which is a pretty long time hopefully, I'm only 21) I will NEVER use your services.

When searching for someone to do body work on my husband's truck, we ran into Mr. Tullock at a local gas station. He saw the damage, walked up and introduced himself and gave us his business card. After looking online at the wonderful reviews, we decided to get a quote from Tullock. He beat out all the other prices that we had gotten, and with the assurance of wonderful online reviews we decided to go with him. He took the truck a few days later and had the body work done in about 6 days - really quick compared to other body shops we had dealt with in the past. The truck looked amazing after the body work, it was affordable, and it was done in a timely manner. We also had some brake work done while the body work was being done, and that went well. We definitely feel like Tullock Automotive is an honest, reputable place to take your vehicle and we will be continuing to service our cars with Tullock for years to come. Would definitely recommend them!

Never shopping there again after two recent terrible experiences. First was an employee wouldn't let a mom in front of me in line exchange a pair of kids shoes for a smaller size. She didn't have a receipt but all she was asking to do was get a smaller size. She ended up leaving in tears and the employee did nothing to help her. Second experience was we bought a lawn mower in 2014 and got the extended 3 year warranty. The sales associate assured us that if we canceled within the 3 year time frame we would get 100% of the warranty price back. Well here it is almost 3 years later and Sears will only refund $44 of the $249 price of the warranty. So the sales associate just lied to our face and management will do nothing to refund the full $249. Never shopping here again.

I would love to give Planet Ballroom an awesome review, but I just can't. They were not willing to work with me and my fiancé to find a package that was affordable for us. They just wanted us to sign up for a package that cost over $400 a month. I have trouble understanding why they want to charge so much when they have Groupons for $75. We had a great time with our instructor for our four private lessons we got with our Groupon, but when we wanted to continue on there was just no way we could afford the outrageous prices. After talking with the manager, he still wanted to charge over $100 a lesson. When we were trying to negotiate the price, the manager simply stopped replying to our emails. We won't be using Planet Ballroom in the future because we definitely feel like our business is not valued. It was fun while it lasted Planet Ballroom, but consider emailing people back.

It was good, but I've had better. The more upscale froyo places such as pinkberry and yoforia definitely are better than Fruiticup, but since there isn't a lot of other froyo options in the university area I would def recommend trying this place. My main problem with Fruiticup was that they didn't have a lot of fresh fruit toppings.

The studio has no facilities, insists on playing ridiculous music; I came here to get away from the stress of my divorce, not listen to Sade singing about her breakup. 
The prices have gone through the roof since she opened her tiny studio in Uxbridge, and all it is now is a money grab; Franchise?? really?

Franchises are normally sold once you have a PROVEN idea that works-not just for the owner, but for hte clients and the franchisees. I have been with you since thestart, and am so frustrated now, that I am no longer saying nice things to people about the experiences there.

In short:
1.focus is money; one on one with Shasta used to be $50 now they are $100-$145/hour-did you get a medicl degree we are not aware of?
2.Calls herself a Transformational and life coach; where did you get your psychology degree?I have known her for years and do not recall any of htese things, only selling more positive karma for $$$$.
3.franchise a business that has no showers, change rooms, blaring music and chatting instructors when we are trying to wind down and get over cancer treatments, divorce, pain and general distress over our lous lives; try to complain and they do not care-too busy to care!
4. Telling people that being registered with the CRA for tuition is like getting FREE training; that is NOT how our tax syste, works-it is a tax deduction, not a wage deduction like an RRSP-this is a blatant lie.
5. the majorityof the instructors have come through their own BLY training and have little to no anatomy outside of htis course; One shoule NEVER do compression of the back/core or extreme Flexion within 45 minutes of waking up-there is still too much fluid ont he disks-WHY don't your instructors know that???
6. Education must be broader; ensure they know that they CANNOT do forceful or any other hands on to clients without asking! A rape victom in child's pose does NOT want hands on her back pushing her further into a stretch-WHAT was she thinking?
7. Instructors SHOULD NOT tell clients before a class that hey should come more regularly in order to "get rid of the rest of that belly". Someone with an eating disorder, struggling for years, does not want to hear this-Actually NOBODY should ever have to hear that from anyone! Disrespectful. We thought that BLY was a safe place, but we gues it no longer cares about anything except money.

too bad. 
If you cared, we would be back.

The service here sucks.  We waited over 24 mins for food.  Our waitress was oblivious. Once she got our order we didn't see her again.  I finally had to flag someone down.  Then once we got our food she asked how everything was and then she was gone again.  I had to flag her down for boxes and check.  The food here is not worth the horrible service.

My two dining companions and I had a wonderful dinner tonight. The surroundings are pretty ordinary, but the food and service quite inspired. The Lamb Osso Bucco was as good as I've ever had, and the apple tart for dessert was just right for the three of us. The place was busy but the service was attentive and unrushed. It was expensive but our Living Social coupon made it pretty reasonable....about $40 apiece.

My wife and I dined at Aquavina last night. It was good but not exceptional. She had the crab cake appetizer which was quite good. I had the wedge salad which was uninspired and the tuna entry which I liked a lot and which came with Forbidden Rice, a new dish for me. The rolls were not hot.
The service was not warm and fuzzy. It was very businesslike, acceptable but not the type service that makes you ready for a return visit.

THE BEST.  My husband played in some World Series of Poker events, but forgot to pick up some souvenirs.  I thought it'd be a lost cause trying to find someone half the country away to help me out, but Anything U Want replied quickly to my texts (TEXTS - YAY!).  It was like talking to a real person (haha) and not just a random disinterested far-away rep.  Even though it was just a few t-shirts, they treated my request with professionalism and diligence - it ended up taking a few trips over a few days because the booth wasn't up the first two times.  When it was finally open, they called me to discuss what was in stock and sent pics of what they picked up.  Couldn't be more pleased.  I thought for sure I'd have to give a few-sentence instruction and hope for the best, but this was like working with someone who really cared about my order.  They got it exactly right and were prompt, professional, and communicative!  Will definitely be keeping their number for future needs.

Dropped my Samsung S7 in a parking lot Tuesday evening.  It was run over by a car before I could retrieve it.  Needless to say, it was crushed.  Visited Nick at Quick Mobile Repair at 9:05 Wednesday morning.  He said I was in luck because it was still "blinking".  He replaced the front of the phone and I was back in business and out of his shop in approx. 40 minutes. Total cost was $199 plus tax.  Verizon told me I would have to pay off my contract ($560) and then buy a new phone.  It was a pleasure dealing with Nick.  He is my "go to" cell phone repair shop forever!!!

What a fantastic company with which to do business!  The professionalism, from the first meeting to the completion of the installation, was second to none.  The honesty and integrity of Sean, Bonnie and the installation crew was beyond what I could ever have hoped.  From signing the contact to the final installation we were kept informed all the way. While there were some hurdles (lack of cooperation from APS), we still received a 1st class installation.  The results are now apparent in the major reduction of our energy bills.  I look forward to a continued and long term relationship with everyone at PEP Solar.

Where should i start? Was excited to try this new restaurant. Came a day before they opened and the lady at the cash was so friendly and welcoming. Came two days later and was not greeted at all. There was no way to tell where to order ...the guy near the food just looked at me with wide eyes. I asked for a mix plate (chicken n beef) he cuts the beef and asks me about my salad n rice choice. He adds the salad to the main part of the takeout container which is usually meant for rice. As for the rice..he litteraly gave me 3 regular size spoon fulls. Then adds the beef...i told him its mixed plate. He doesnt aknowledge. Removes some of the beef that already has tahini sauce on it and adds some chicken. I go to pay and the cashier is on his phone texting and i was visible to him. I ask if this is where i pay and he says yes and apologizes...i gave him a 20 and later realized he overcharged me by $3. The food taste was good but i would never go back. A new restaurant should embrace new customers and win them over forever. Interested to see how others were treated

PLEASE DO NOT GO THERE! They are only interested in making money. They recommended extreme measures that were not necessary and kept pushing tests, injections, hospital stay and surgery that was not warranted. The vet, the assistant, and the front desk staff kept trying to push expense procedures. I knew they were just trying to scam us. After paying $260 for a visit and x-ray and rejecting their other recommendations, our pet is doing fine. He just had an upset stomach and was fine by the next morning. They never followed up with us the next day to see if our pet was okay. VERY DISAPPOINTED! PLEASE BE AWARE!

Had nasty urine and poop stains from my dog and thought the smell would never disappear after I found my dog a new home. Had Cliff from Certified Specialists come out and he completely fixed my carpet to where it looks brand new now! Plus people don't have to walk into my apartment plugging their nose! Saved me from getting yelled at by my apartment complex AND he gave me a great price! Thanks Cliff! Definitely going to use you in the future!

After my pregnancy with my first child I was looking for a trainer to help me lose the baby weight, learn how to eat healthier and be my cheerleader through my weight loss journey. John Turose has done all of that and more! Not only have I lost 30 pounds since working with John, but I have gained muscle where I never thought I could. He pushes me to do my best and gives me the confidence to try harder. I HIGHLY recommend John to anyone who needs help losing weight, wants to build muscle, fix their posture, or anything when it comes to your body. He is AMAZING!

- song selection sucks
- customer service horrible
- microphones don't work
- shitty sound quality
- walls are paper thin (although this was kind of a positive because we could hear how much fun people in the next rooms were having)
OVERALL NOT A GOOD KARAOKE PLACE.

i got my nails done my cindy. i got biogel fake nails. she clumped on the biogel like cement and then shaved it down till my fingers were numb. i got home and one of my nails is lifting already. she told me to come in the next day to get it fixed by anyone because its her day off. i called to make an appt and the very rude lady kept saying but cindy is not in today. she then very rudely told me to come in whenever. I will never ever come back here again. go across the street to the other nail salon with the red sign they are friendlier and do a better job. they just happen to be closed the moment i decided to get my nails done.

Coming to this place is like rolling the dice and praying for meat that isnt too chewy or sushi that isnt too funky. It was definitely better a few years ago and has since gone downhill. Service is not so great either. If you get a waitress that speaks english then consider yourself lucky!! I'm asian so thats not racist.

Zero stars!! My friend and I went to this Whole Foods this past Friday and had the worst experience. While standing in the area by the spring water, my 2yo was fussing. I noticed a customer and the cashier looking at us. The customer shook her head and turned back to the cashier and made a motion with her hand smacking her lips. The cashier laughed and made a motion cupping one hand and back hand smacking the cupped hand with his other hand. They looked at us again and the customer kept talking while she was frowned up. 

I went to them and said I know you're not implying I smack my child. They just looked; the customer still frowned up. As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. 

After this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. 

Before leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. 

Once leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. 

It's nice to know that the Whole Foods staff sticks together no matter what from the top on down. I will find out if Corporate sticks by this kind of foolishness. 

Oh... Before I left I saw the cashier pushing the supervisors cart to her car and they were chatting it up for a while.

I went in for my normally scheduled maintenance and had the pleasure of working with Dan. The mechanic found a nail in my tire and it was replaced with no out of pocket expenses due to the coverage I added for my tires when purchasing my vehicle. The timing of the service was not too long. Thank you!

I got a great haircut from Pamela! The wait was short and the atmosphere relaxed.  I used to go to Great Clips but this was a superior experience in every way. She used a straight razor on the back of my neck and to straighten my sideburns, and we had a pleasant conversation that passed the time.  I would recommend Ray's.

Shane Wilson is horrible with coloring hair.   I came in for partial highlights. I've been getting my hair highlighted for 20 years and never had this kind of experience.  He fried my hair... He painted an inch size band around my face. He didn't use foils and painted it right on my scalp. The next day when I washed my hair it was sticky and stretchy like spaghetti; falling out by chunks...  absolute disaster. I spent the whole day trying to restore my hair.  I asked Shane for my money back and he got defensive and basically said I can try to fix it or you can go else where... He didn't do it right the first time, you think I'm going to trust him to do it a 2nd.   One month later and my hair is still messed up.. Don't trust Shane with coloring your hair. BEWARE

I went here today for a nice meal. The waiter was great. I asked for my dueling lobster tails to be served without shrimp. The meal was brought out with the shrimp in it. Even though the manager asked me what I needed and apologized, there was no offer to take money off of my meal for the mistake. In addition, I was charged ninety nine cents because of my request. This is not how customers should be treated.

I attended this location on a Wednesday, one of the days they're open late. I asked the girl working at the reception if an appointment was neccessary for a cut and colour. She informed me that no, an appointment was not needed. She was nice, cheerful and informative. She told me about the current specials as well. I said that I would return the following day. 
The next day, I returned to this location at 5:30 with a friend. We both said that we wanted a colour and cut. It was the same girl working at the front desk. She was disappearing, on and off the phone, and otherwise out to lunch - so to speak. She gave us forms to fill out with our contact information and told us it was an hour to an hour and a half wait - Really, no appointments? She then got on the phone and made herself unavailable. My friend and I stood there waiting for someone to assist us. Eventually, the instructor, who had been busy doing another sudent's highlights in plain view, came over to take our forms and she said she would call us when our spot was open. 
My friend and I went to some shops in the plaza to kill time. 6:45 rolls around and we still hadn't gotten a call. We went back into the school (I don't want to call it a salon...) and let the front desk staff know we were back. We waited until 7... Nothing. They wouldn't even give us an estimate on the time. They said there were two people ahead of us. I struck up conversation with a woman who was also waiting. She said she also came in arounf 5:30 - for a ROOT TOUCH UP - and was STILL waiting. She made a good point... she could have gone home and done it herself in that time. I approached the desk around 7:15 and spoke to a student, the same student who was getting highlights done in her own hair earlier. She told me that as soon as she was done - and pointed to her own hair - she would help me. Um... ok.
At 7:30, we were still not served or given a time that we would be. I approached the desk and informed them we had been waiting 2 HOURS and that this was entirely unacceptable and bullsh-t. The same instructor that was doing highlights on the student earlier had only said "I do apologize." I told her she should be teaching these students professionalism and correct customer service, neither which was present in this place.  I also let her know that I completely understood that this was a SCHOOL and not a salon, and that I therefore knew it would be a little slower but that it was common sense to let their customers know what was going on as we had been waiting. she kept saying "I do apologize"... nothing else. I asked once again what the time frame for waiting would be. She then said half an hour to an hour. I asked her if she was for real... to which she said yes. I then told her we are NOT waiting three hours for this... and told her to dispose of our contact sheets that we initially filled out. I told her, now with an audience of two students - one who was the girl working the front desk - that I had attended this location the previous day and thought the prices, staff and reviews looked good. I told her I had recommended this location to my friends and family to check out. I then explained that I would retract that and that I would never recommend it again.

What a terrible experience. I'm looking at this as a blessing in disguise!

I have got to admit it was not what I had imagined when entering Riad.  I'm thinking of a Moroccan feel, very aromatic/herbally, and very calming music.  I also imagined separate rooms for each service offered...What I had received is this..
 
Entering on the 2nd floor of a very old building, into just a regular room with a high chair/foot rest on one end and the manicure station next to it.  Also in the room was the Moroccan sit down/waiting room along with the front desk.  So this small room consist of all of the setting described above.  Then in another room was the facial station/massage station separated by a curtain.
I wouldn't have such an issue with the setting but I did have an issue with the experience/professionalism of the service. Please see below:
 
1)  The short hand and toe fix is just taking off our nail polish and clipping it down.  Followed by continuous filing on your nails that actually was unnecessary because it was already to the skin part of the nail (that really hurt).  Also my cousin had stated that she had extra skin that is near her fingernail so it was already cut to wear she wanted it but the owner insisted she knew what she was doing and that she will cut it.  On top of it, she did not massage my hands nor my foot.  Shows that she really doesn't listen to her customers.  What is nice was the paraffin feet and hand that she provided.
 
2) Then we went into the massage/facial room.  I was given the back scrub first and my cousin was given the facial.  My back scrub was fine.  My cousin's facial was fine for the most part.  Now the funny thing is, so she gave me 20 minutes to relax and then came into the room to wake me up.  I do not think her assistant knew what she was doing for she kept asking the owner what to do.  Then, she told me I had to go shower!  What????  So she stood there in the massage room while I was naked trying to get on my robe (weird). So...she took me to a bathroom down the hall..the bathroom was so disgusting and I had to get up in the stand up shower to rinse off my back  and the paraffin hand/foot treatment.  While I was in the gross disgusting stand up shower, barefoot-keep in mind, the woman opens the door and asks if everything is okay.  Who does that??
 
3) After the shower, I came back and sat in the massage room.  She told me to lay down again and she gave me I guess at most a 15 minute "moroccan massage"-which was not relaxing at all.  And on top of that her hands slipped and punched me in the cheeks.
 
4) Facial was okay.  I don't think the towel they put on me was a clean towel.  I felt like it was the same towel that was probably from my feet.  The facial was nothing spectacular and it did not serve it's justice.
 
I really, really had a bad experience with this massage place.  I feel mostly bad for my cousin because she's never been to a day spa.  What she experienced is not a good impression of what a dayspa should really be.  She was not a licensed massage therapist but yet she wants to do all services.  If you are not experienced..you should not do it.  It says on there she was a licensed podology.  She kept pushing her product line and repeatedly informed her that we were not interested.  At one point, I told her I was from the states and that I was flying home so I wouldn't be able to carry all the products onto the plane.  She suggested that I send it through the post office..ummm I don't think so.  It would cost alot of money to send out of the country.  And last but not least her hidden fees.  So I guess this living social deal did not include the taxes.  She charged 13% for Canadian taxes and then an automatic service fee (which I think is a bunch of bullshit since it was crappy services) of 17%.  So we already paid 99.00 for the services and then forced 30.00 for fees/services?  Really??  

I don't think I will be going back....

This is the worst rental car company I've ever dealt with.  Not only did we have to wait for an hour and a half in line to pick up the rental car, but the company added on a additional charges for fuel (even though I filled the tank full within a few miles of the rental car return) as well as late return fees.  

We had returned our vehicle on time according to the rental agreement, and when we did, their system was down.  We asked for a receipt or something showing the car was returned on time and they told us they couldn't provide anything.  When the final charge came in, they added on a late return charge and printed the receipt after their system was back up.  

I will never use this company again and I recommend you avoid them too.  The price is initially low when you reserve a car, but they add on false charges afterward.

The food was very average. I just don't see the draw to this place. We went on a Friday night and the place wasn't crowded but it was full of bikers and loud folks. Smokers on the patio and a huge dog (brought along by a guest) stared us down the whole time we ate. He even lunged at my husband. The ribs and chicken were dry, as was the Mac and Cheese. The upside is our drinks were great. So I'd say go for drinks, skip the food, don't expect any sort of civility from guests.

Hallllo!
Nun auch ich möchte gerne mal etwas positives über unser Grünberger Körperforum berichten.
habe dort meinen Fitnessführerschein gemacht und bin angenehm überrascht , über die Freundlichkeit und Hilfbereitschaft der Trainer und anderen Mitarbeitern. 
Ich werde weiterhin dort meine sportlichen Leistungen ausüben.
es ist nur schade das sich auf manchen Beiträgen so einige Nörgler und und Nörglerinnen befinden die das Forum mies machen aber dann liegt es oft an den Kunden selbst wie sie sich in diesen Forum einbringen.
ich bin der Auffassung Probleme und Missfallen sollte man ansprechen,
und allen Anderen wünsche ich ein gutes Miteinander in unseren Forum!

They are really bad. Staffs are incompetent, screwed up my order, food took forever to come (we probably sat there for an hour and a half), the servers straight up ignored us when we wanted to ordered food. Like honestly, how can you screw up on a order for burgers...it's really not that hard..... I would not recommend anyone to go to that place as you can probably find better food elsewhere. Their poutines are decent tho, the server (well... the tall dude) is rude. I don't think they got the hint that we wanted the bill until they saw us standing there with our coat  for good 10 mins with my credit card out.

Regular here. I'm from Vancouver and I always keep an eye for decent sushi in Toronto. I used to go to this place once a week... not anymore

Good sushi, fair price, discount of takeout, what's not to like? 

Yesterday, I went there for my usual Love Boat take out order and I noticed that huge price jump. The price for the Love Boat B was 45.99 and it's now 62.99. I was initially confused by it and then realized that they've changed all menus. Looked around and the restaurant is now empty without any take out order then everything started to click and I know why. 

Since I have to wait for the order to come, I went back to my car and grabbed the old menu and went back to the restaurant to compare with the new prices. The lady came by and took my old menu away! Sneaky sneaky

If anyone has any recommendations to any other comparable sushi restaurant, it would be greatly appreciated. $17 price jump on the same order is not cool. As much as I love sushi, I'm not paying that.  

I'm going to miss that nice lady that yells "hello, AKANNNEE" on the phone

It's very nice....but Augustus is still my favorite.  The spa is on that side.  You can read from the earlier posts....welcome tea, robes, slippers, turn down service with a lavender spray, our elevators worked perfectly....need your key to get to the elevator...to get to the room. The staff was fabulous...! Also, the spa at Caesars is fantastic....if girls are going...it's a must...take your suits..relax...and you have access all day.  Bottom line...I love Caesars!

If you like Taiwanese food or just a fan of chicken, Koo Koo Chicken is for you.

I got the chicken bites with fries and a taro bubbletea. The food is incredibly well-seasoned and filled with flavor, the chicken is tender and not too overcooked. I love the variety of topping spices they have (seaweed, black pepper, spicy, lemon, etc) that go really well with the chicken and fries. This is a new favourite for me anytime I'm in town!

We had afternoon tea at the Lobby Lounge on a Sunday afternoon for eight guests.

The ambiance is wonderful, with live musician playing a piano rendition of modern songs. 

The quality of the food platter was excellent. There was a large selection of sandwiches, biscuits and desserts for everyone and it was quite filling. Each bite had a unique and vibrant flavor. I was blown away, everything just tasted so good.

There is a big variety of teas. We poured ourselves a cup of tea and then rotated our teapots so that we could try everyone's selection. Each tea had its unique aroma and taste.

If I had to complain about one thing, it would be the speed of the service. Our waitress was friendly but there were only two wait staff in the dining area serving a lot of guests at the same, so it took a long time to get our bill and leave. It was an 1 hour and 30 minute seating time but we stayed for 2.5 hours because of the wait.

Overall, I had a great experience and I would love to come back.

I used their services for 2 different events. Both contained special requests. The cupcake cake I ordered was not only beautiful, but delicious as well. The specialty cupcakes I bought for party favors were amazing and the guests who received them are still raving about them. Emily, the store manager, is wonderful and both orders were exactly what I asked for. I highly recommend using them for your next party.

What Can I say..They are the BEST!!!!!

I took in a poster to be Framed, that needed some custom work and colors...
When I went in to pick it up WOW!  It was fantastic!!

Alan, the owner suggested a way to frame it...and he was 1000% right

When I got home it looked great on my wall..

If you're looking for the perfect framing, this is the place.

Price was good..and service was excellent and it was done in a few days..

When you go into the store, you can see some great Framing they are doing for other clients.

A Very Happy Customer!

I stop in to get a price for replacing my car carpet...the car is my work car and after 2-years
the inside was awful beyond cleaning..The owner- Chuck, looked at carpet and gave me price that was fair.  Other Upholstery shops that I went into... the estimates were ridiculous....

I brought the car in for repair, and the JOB was FANTASTIC!!!
And it was a done in a few hours.

The carpet match the one I had in the car...and the carpet was much better than the one in the car when I bought it new.

Everybody was very nice...and Chuck, answered all my questions..and I could tell he knows he's stuff...

I'm a very happy customer...and so glad I found C & L Upholstery, they are the best!!!

My son told me about this place. Said the the food was excellent and the tacos were a WOW!!.  We were out together and decided to have lunch there and to our surprise they are closed on Weds.

A  few weeks later I was in the area stopped in to have lunch. The tacos were amazing and everything else that came with the meal.

I stopped in again yesterday and the food was great..

It's worth the drive and you will NOT be disappointed and the prices are good.

I don't write a lot of reviews, but the time to do this is well worth it.

Try it once, you will come back for more.

It took me  3 or 4 months to find the right Auto Body Repair.
After getting repair estimates from other repair shops that were ridiculous
I stop in at Northern Auto & Equipment to get a estimate..

The price was fair so I said ok I will have them fix my car.

WOW!!!  when I pick up my car, its was perfect!  
The body work was done right, the paint matched perfectly.

Everybody was friendly and they answered all my questions
and the price was exactly what they said it would cost.

I'm a HAPPY customer...if your looking to get your Autobody work on your car..
go there and see for yourself

Also, my car was fixed in a timely matter..

The food is excellent and prices are good.  The owners are friendly and they always welcome you with a smile!  
The Place is spotless, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and I was amazed how clean it was.

My son and I, when were on Deer valley we always go there for lunch...

The service is very good. We never have to wait long to get our food.

I give them a 5-Star rating, because I like everything about this place.

Give it a try, you will not be disappointed and the food is GREAT!

The Best!!!!

The work is excellent..I took my 2014 Toyota Camry to get my bumper fix. Just had my new car for a few months and backed up to a pole.  When I got the car back the paint was a perfect match.

The service was awesome, very friendly and helpful and answered all my questions.

The car was also fixed on time and the car was totally washed and cleaned inside and out
amazing service.

They get 5-STARS, because everything they told me was done. And most important the work on my car was PERFECT!!!

If you want your car done right, this is the place.

I had the BEST experience here yesterday! Found out the gender of my little girl at 15 weeks and 6 days. The tech was amazing and so nice. Also, the man who made my appointment was very kind and professional. 

Also, after I finished filling out my paperwork and used the bathroom, I went back to the lobby and there was a couple there who bought me a heart beat animal! How nice is that?! Seriously made my day and definitely my week. I wish I knew how I could thank them in a better way because I cannot show my appreciation enough! 

Will DEFINITELY be coming back later in my pregnancy! I haven't been treated this well by a business in a long time! Thank you, Miracle View!

Not happy with my meal. I got the Mama Mia which is gyro meat on top of a small amount of lettuce, tomatoes and onions, and a dozen small pieces of pita bread. All I could taste was oregano! The meat and the bread were heavy on Oregano, the bread seriously covered. Another odd thing is that their Greek salad doesn't have greek olives. No olives. I also bought a cupcake, which was dry and crumbly as cornbread. It was obviously old.

The best thing about our meal there as our server, who was very good at his job! But the place is dirty. Every table had a thick built up grease covering, so thick people had scratched their initials in the grease! A good scrubbing is in order, to say the least. Food was okay, but not great. Will pass in the future.

Disappointing. The asian salad was good, fresh, nice flavor in the dressing. The focaccia bread, fresh. The strawberry salad was fresh, but the strawberry dressing was overpowering.  Too sweet. A light vinaigrette would have been better. The Thai coconut soup--nice flavor in the broth but the long stringy dry chicken strings in it ruined this soup! Made it very hard to eat, and the strings were dry and ew. like twine in your soup! The bakery case has huge cookies and cupcakes, etc. They look delicious but the reality is stale, non flavorful, dry. The pineapple upside down cupcake was dry, and tasted like a piece of cornbread with an old piece of pineapple on it.  The cream horn was good, but whoopie pies, dry. Stale. I really wanted to love this place, but no.

The management doesn't care about the health or well-being of their residents. They act like they are all afraid of something, like if they fix something it will come out of their own pockets. Makes you wonder if they get bonuses for not doing repairs! The maintenance staff are ill-trained and do an incomplete job on anything they're asked to do. I have had to fix what they fixed after they left! There are water issues, mold issues, trash issues, parking issues, the list is long. So glad we got out of there. I pity anyone who lives there.

Tried for the first time today, and loved it! Chicken flavor and texture is very good, cooked just right. Sweet potato fries, good amount and very crispy. The corn salad, with edamame, cilantro, tomato, cucumber and feta was awesome. The dressing was soo good. Clean, bathroom clean. Just great experience for "fast" food.

The chopped beef sandwich was awesome. Big portion, and very nicely seasoned. The quarter chicken was good, but we expected a breast and a wing but got a thigh and leg. We prefer a half chicken, but this isn't available. The meat is very good. The sides were not good. We had the potato salad, the "white" slaw and Mac and cheese. All meh.

Sweet little place! Great burgers!! Live music. Sorry to hear they are moving to a new location. Loved the little house!
Second trip--crab "burger" was like a blob of crab salad on a bun. Not real tasty for me. Husband tried the crab and shrimp stuffed portobello- 2 1/2 stars out of 5, he said. It was thickly covered with melted cheese, a (less than) subtle touch it could be much better without. He said the asparagus was good. The service was good, and they did comp my meal, which was nice of them. In the future we will stick to the burgers!! Live music was very pleasant. Beers good.

Very disappointed in the food and service. Pretzel with cheese dip: Vegetarians beware. There is bacon in the dip not noted on menu. Spiedi sandwich: No sauce, just meat and bread. Meat flavored okay, but sandwich lacks. Homemade chips good, but sauce is thinned down ranch dressing. Onion straws very good, fish tacos good. Major problem is service. Understaffed? Don't know but it took 15 mins for server to even come near us and we had to grab her attention to ask for drinks. She complied but acted unwilling at first and took her time reappearing and seemed distracted all night. Won't return.

We built our own pizza as their specialty selections weren't to our liking. We ordered the large size. The flavor of the pizza was very good, the sauce, everything fresh and delicious. The crust was not cooked well in the center, though, and was not crisp like NY style normally is. Not doughy but not cooked well. The outside was great. Then the cookie dessert was cooked at much too high of a temp and was burned. We ordered another and this one was raw.  After we sent the first cookie dessert back, our waiter disappeared. We did not see him again before we left! We flagged the manager down to finish our transaction. This place is in the south, maybe it is considered rude to send something back?

My two daughters have been coming here for the past 2 years.  The facilities are comfortable, with several convenient areas (stadium seating for viewing the pool, snack bar, tables & chairs, playroom).  We've had the opportunity to experience many different instructors, all of whom seem to have a genuine interest in and a special knack for working with young kids.  The swim objectives at each level are clearly demonstrated to the kids during their lessons.  All of the staff, both in and out of the water, are very personable, helpful, and accommodating......whether it relates to fear of the water, scheduling lessons and makeups, a child having a bad day, or swim techniques and advice.  My girls started out with no swim abilities or experience, both of them crying during their lessons for the first few weeks.  Now they both can swim and love coming to class each week!

I don't usually write reviews, but I felt this was necessary. Today was my first and last time coming here.
Let's start with my experience with scheduling the appointment. I called the salon and was answered by a man's voice with a simple, "Hello?" I wasn't sure if I dialed the correct number since that was the only thing he said. I asked if it was Binh's Hair Salon and he replied with "Yeah." As that should have been my sign to just hang up and schedule elsewhere, I proceeded to give the business the benefit of the doubt and asked if I could schedule an appointment. The man said, "Yeah, sure," and hung up as soon as I said my requested date and time.
So, the appointment day came and I arrived early. When it was my turn, the woman at the desk told me I could sit in the next available chair. I asked if I could get my hair washed prior to my haircut and she quickly said, "You can or you don't have to, it's five dollars extra if you want your hair washed," and I said yes that's fine. She responded in a way as if it were an inconvenience for her to wash my hair as she directed me to the sink.
Fast forward to the hair cut: as he was cutting my hair, he kept looking away and glancing at the door as he snipped my hair!! My hair ended up looking choppy and uneven. I was so upset with the results, but I didn't want to cause a scene and just paid quickly in order to leave asap.The woman's demeanor quickly changed and she was all of sudden super nice and polite as I pulled out my payment.
If you're wondering, no it has nothing to do with the language barrier, because I'm Vietnamese as well! They were just incredibly rude and unprofessional. Poor quality hair cut and poor attitudes. I thought the other reviews were more honest, but I think it's inaccurate. I probably could have gotten a better haircut and service from a student stylist.

I rarely do this but I am changing my 1 * to 4* for BRL thanks to the owner, Jake, who took the time to address my concerns regarding the original outrageous quote I received from them. After getting a better understanding of my needs and revising the quote we were able to get it in-line with my expectations. They went the extra mile and was able to help me install the door on the same day. That's what I call service! I am a fan and may actually become a repeat customer if the need arises.

Sashimi Salad: OVERPRICED & UNDERWHELMING!!!  I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. 
 After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. 
Most sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4"x6". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.

We also tried their fried pork chops served with a freshly made sauce,  excellent and their Roti (a sweet fried crepe Thai dessert) was to die for.

Owners were very friendly, prices very fair. Overall, this will be one of my favorite Vegas eats.

Nails have white tips uneven and pedicure has the polish not covering all my toe nails!! So I go up front to pay for crape service with the gift card and they want me to pay the extra charge for using  THEIR GIFT CARD because its not cash.

Was there yesterday for lunch.  Trying to eat healthy so I ordered the sauteed vegetable sandwich (served on a french baguette - probably not real healthy but ya' gotta live a little - right?).  The sandwiches are served with chips and a side salad.  Our Server knew I was trying to eat healthy, so she offered me a double serving of the side salad and to skip the chips.  I took her up on that offer.  The sandwich was excellent.  All the ingredients were very fresh and the prices were right!  My sons each got the "Sconnie" sandwich and paid a small up-charge for the french fries. They said the sandwich was awesome as were the fries. Our Server was very pleasant.  We will definitely be going back!

Oh and the deserts are real good too, take them to go. In goodness they have tea and such on the house, as is custom. Moustafa runs a good operation here, along with the ladies kept in back.

Boy ole boy, this place rocks me every time I go there. It more than helps if you know some spanish, or do your homework. Otherwise all your questions will be answered like your partially deaf grandparents, 'head shaking yes...', by the short central american ladies.
I had the, Pollo Catracho-Pollo Frito Estilo Hondureño, on my last venture in there with real genuine horchata. I rolled out of the place literally. They do not miss a beat with sides and fresh condiments. For the gringos, there is the typical bottles of sauces and such. But WTF you need that for when you can eat the roasted jalepeno, onions and radishes. Damn. I have yet to go there for breakfast, because I usually want to do something in the morning rather than go back to sleep. lol. Now you know why they have them images of the mexican having a siesta on the cactus. The dude just ate here!

There are days, when this shit is on my mind. Then it sinks down to my stomach and I find myself heading to Popeyes. But stay focused, because its also a minimart gas station, so if your a people person, like me, its like TV, they also have one blaring too. You can also feel outlawish, by getting "free" refills. They also have wi-fi, so you can slow your heart and arteries with greasy chicken and gravy with lots of salt and butter and comb or stalk whatever sites you desire. Plus look at all the weirdos coming and going. Oh and for you antique people, just behind this location is a big ass antique store, so you can waddle your way over, most drive, cause we americans, and settle that chicken looking at stuff you don't need.

Well, a few years ago, I started with the "intro" offer for $35, since then, it has expanded to over a $100 a month for the same service. They double bill you after the intro offer and then begin to add late charges, then start a new "start" date from your original date. I got my service date on the 27th, then they moved it to the 10th and now its the 30th of the previous month, basically cutting me off a month. When the cut you off and you pay, its another "reactivation" fee, yet its all computers. I could go on further with this corporate monster, but you get the picture, yet there is not other here in tempe, some how the politicians have sold it all to two corporations, the internet. Stay away if you can. Its all a scam.

OK, so I had the $8.00 lunch. My first question was, what happened to these places??? Beyond the basic food, its filthy, food everywhere and the people, wow. I mean it looks like this is where obese people go to gorge. "Oh, have a pint of ice cream and sugar to wash down that salad" The lady in front of me was scooping some white-yellow pasta stuff out of the serving spoon with her fingers. The decor, whats with the baby shit green color and macro shots of tomatoes sweating? Tomatoes do not sweat. Oh and then some old lady in yoga pants. I mean, baggy yoga pants??? I had my salad and soup and left, the food was ok, but the patrons, leave you feeling no so good. So, if you want cheap nutrition and some OMG moments, go here.

These cats got it all going for them. Taste, price and coolness. If your all into the scene and need to be catered to, like your paris hilton, don't bother. It also has a great market selection, mine being the deserts and sweets. The plates have some good choice, I go the way of a main kabob, rice (mmmm), hummus and fries. They also lay on the pita bread, so its all good here. Oh, and be sure to bring someone you can converse with or something to read, its not fast food, so relax.

First and foremost, this is pretty much TRADITIONAL Navajo food. Not any other native american or american indian type of food. It is the basics, because in the real Navajo world, not the material world of Phoenix and urban areas, there is no electricity and such. Its not food all jazzed up with spices and thick sauces, etc, like americans like and desire. Certainly not the salty taste that is american food, or passes for taste. So, in the area of actual Navajo food, the Scared Hogan does it well. As for the expense, its organic as you can get, but thats the Navajo food way, and not advertised and used as a gimmick, like the american food way, hence, its a bit more in cost. An example is, the mutton (sheep) is bought on the Navajo Nation. Navajo's know tis because we cantaste the difference, between a sheep raised on Navajo land vegetation and sheep not raised on it. 
All in all, the Sacred Hogan, is the best traditional style Navajo food served in the greater Phoenix area, except at my house, haha.

You never know with this place. Today it was, "We're out of that right now." I mean, they only have two type of house coffee and one is out. The pumpkin chocolate chip cake was oily, yeah, oily and with the light coffee I settled for, it was all half and half nutmeg taste in my mouth.
Oh and its also one of those places, people with no wi-fi sit around at ;)

First off, if you like ambience and decor, don't go here. If you like good Asian and Pacific Rim food, then do go here. These people do not, and I mean do not, f**k around with the good food they serve. What they lack in service, sometimes you got to wait longer than it takes to grow the food, they more than make up in what they do right and thats make good food from their respective origins. To boot, you always have enough to take home, now I know its american to over eat and one serving can serve an entire Vietnam family, but its good, to have some great lunch the next day. Tip: When you go in and see one table, get it. Smile at the lady, maybe even slightly bowing and make for that table. It can get crowded. Oh, and lots and lots of TOGO orders here for those who like TV or children with their food, hence the wait.

After a good movie at near Harkins, we went to this location in shopville. I order the most basics of greek food, a "gyro". Now, you would think this corporation would at least get this right, no. The meat was dry and four pieces of what passes for tomatoes in america these days, were just awful. So its on to the humus and pita bread. I mean did they store the pita in a steamer? Two of the most basics, ruined and awful.

Food City is a "Meeh-he-co" experience in itself. The deli is good for cerviche, burritos and the like. The bakery has those great empanadas, try the pineapple. The fruit and vegetable section is par none, with great variety and prices. Lets just say, their are always mexicans and asian folks buying fruits and vegetables there. They know this stuff. To top it all off, on somedays, they BBQ whole chicken outside on real wood coals, not that charcoal bullshit and not gringo gas, but real bonafide wood. This yardbird is good, and if your real nice, buy some green chiles and ask the person to roast them for you outside and slip them a few dollars ;) Like I said, Meeh-he-co experience.

One after another, so many have tried to open a food place in this very same spot. Along comes this chinese food establishment and BINGO! I have tried it a few times and the last time, it was packed, and with mostly chinese people ;) 
In all my favorite is anything noodles. That tasty well seasoned wok in the kitchen sure makes it taste good every time.
The young waiter staff is at a loss every time, so you gotta take charge here, for instance, don't wait for your check. For you gringos, you gotta ask for anything more than chopsticks, cause they won't ask or provide them, but hey, get it together and learn. Food is good and consistent.

I go here for the fries. If you were raised on potatoes, like me, some days, all you want is fucking potatoes fried. The large portion is enough for two, so you can take some home and pull them (use a knife if your a girl) apart and fry them up with some eggs for breakfast. The other stuff is just that, nothing fancy, yet I still don't know how peanuts fit into it all. Only downside of this location is the MEGA-FLIES. I counted an average of four on my table all the time. Since I was alone, if you looked at me from afar, I looked like one of the Mill Avenue homeless, thrashing about in the corner, complete with brown bag (fries). Its worth to me.

Northern Mexico food, at its best. Beans are homemade and good, have not got sick yet, so its been fresh. You do know, 9/10 times its bad beans, when you get sick, lol.
They throw in some chips and salsa's to spoil your meal, buy hey, its up to you. Service is good and football (soccer in america) is always on, yeah.
I do breakfast here sometimes and its the spot when I am hungry after work, so its a no miss for me. Posole and menudo too, not just on every other full moon when a democrat is president ;)
They also have small bar in the back, but alcohol is not my thing so, who knows.

After 11 days driving through the SW in June and in super-heat, I was in Vegas, near the airport, for 3 days (117 degrees) and wanted a massage very much.  I found Susan of Hired Hands Massage from an online search, and she was less than 10 minutes away.  I was able to get a 90 minute deep tissue massage that afternoon.  Excellent massage, great location with shaded parking, and such a reasonable price!  I highly recommend Susan for massage in Las Vegas.

Simply HORRIBLE! One hour late when picking us up from home, one hour late picking us up from SFO. Phone staff is rude and never apologized once even though it was 11pm and we were waiting out in the cold weather for over an hour. The driver who eventually picked us up at SFO (after me calling seven times asking where the driver was - and the answer always being 5 minutes) never said a word, never apologized. Picking up other passengers we learned that they had waited even longer - one for TWO HOURS! The drivers going both ways were both reckless and my wife likened it to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. In short, NEVER, EVER use Marin Door to Door!!!

My daughter and I really enjoy eating here. We tend to order the same thing every time because it's so good. She gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo and I get the grilled salmon nicoise salad. They both rock. It's cafeteria style all the way up to the point you pay, then you are served the rest of the way by a waiter who brings you your food and takes care of you. The food is always very fresh and delicious. And by the time we're out of there, it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond. Highly recommended.

If the service were better I'd consider returning since the location is nice, but I can spent my money better elsewhere.

They were extremely professional and friendly as well as efficient. The Nurse Practitioner Kristen Branche was professional and friendly. She took her time explaining my concerns.   Lisa, her assistant was very friendly and helpful.  I had a test that was ordered and she went out of her way to make sure I knew where to go.  Just a great experience!    Highly recommend.

The best pie I ever had and will ever have.
Definitely go for traditional taste.
I regret that I only ate one piece of it. It seemed a bit big but it was multi thin layer of pie crust made it look big, so you can actually eat a lot of them!
If I visit Toronto again in near future, I must stop by to try other taste like Kiwi.

Convenience is, indeed, the only reason to go here.  There are a surprising (surprised me, at least) lack of Mexican places within walking distance of this part of downtown Phoenix.  I work in the area, so I end up eating here once a month or so because I've been to the spots around it an exhaustive number of times, or I just really want some beans and rice on a particular day.

Said beans and rice are acceptable but don't rise above that level.  The entrees are meh.  I usually get the tacos because, again, they're generally acceptable if not great.  Like many I found service to be slow and, given that the sub-Filiberto's fast quality of what you get, I don't see any excuse for that.  It's never been particularly busy when I've gone in, so it wasn't that the staff were horribly pressed, either.

You can do better, is the bottom line, but if you REALLY want Mexican on a particular day, El Portal is...there.

Not sure if the bartender was new but it took forever to get our drinks and she couldn't even get them right. The worst part is the guy who claims to be the owner was annoying, he keep trying to pick up my friend who is married. Aside from that, he shouldn't be talking to the patrons in that sexual fashion.

I'll admit I've only ever had the poutine here, but I'm a repeat poutine customer at J'm la frite as its in my neighbourhood. Usually I've gotten it to-go but one time I dined in with a friend. It's a nice restaurant, clean, nice ambiance. There are several booths that would be equally good for families or for getting lunch with a friend.

I've had the poutine several times over the past two years or so and it's just right (in my opinion; your poutine preferences may vary). A good amount of fresh cheese curds, the fries aren't cut too thick or too thin, and the gravy's not too dark and heavy like at some other places I've eaten. The price is right -- I believe the small poutine (which for me is a generous enough serving) and can of pop I usually get is $9.

Finally, I've always gotten polite and friendly service when I've eaten here. I've taken friends here before and I would do it again if I want to get poutine with them close to home.

I went to Best Buy this morning (5/7/2017) to return a defective router that I purchased on 4/13/2017.  I had my receipt. The Customer Service Representative refused to take the product back citing the 15-day return policy.  He further indicated I had to deal with the manufacturer - Belkin.  Again, the router is "dead", after only 24 days.

I pointed out to him that it was a Best Buy floor person that recommended the router, but he would not take the product back.

Basically, I take issue with Best Buy not backing the products they sell; especially when the product fails in a short period of time.  Given that I spent a couple thousand dollars at Best Buy (two computers) over the past six months, plus I am a "Rewards Member", I guess I was expecting too much.

I wound up going to Target to purchase a new router.  It is my intention to avoid buying anything further from Best Buy, given they do not back the products they sell.

For completeness:  Working with Belkin was no better.  it took two phone calls and three associates to get an RMA, which is going to be more of a hassle than it is worth.  I point out this interaction as a caution, because Belkin was surprised that Best Buy would not take the product back.  Again, a classic case of getting caught between two entities, blaming each other.

Dr. Yeramilli (sic) is an excellent doctor - very thorough and efficient.  However, I cannot recommend Target Optical for purchasing frames/glasses.  They have a limited selection and frankly, they are very expensive; even with insurance.  In addition, I found my lenses noticeably thicker, even though I ordered their high end lenses - i.e. I am not sure I received what I ordered. 

I can go to Costco Optical and get a superior pair of single-vision glasses (UV, Scratch Resistant, and Transition lenses) for less than half price I paid at Target Optical; plus the frame selection is better.

If I am going to continue spending the amount of money on Target classes, I might as well go to LensCrafters - they have a superior product and frame selection.

I decided on this awesome place due to reviews here and the pics they've uploaded. It's obvious these ladies know color and I was fairly certain they could pull off a faux hawk with shaved sides. :P
After thinking about it and pondering for over a year I finally decided I'd get my dream hair. Walked in to score an appointment for my day off and got Shannon- who penciled me in and seemed interested in what I wanted. :) Which immediately made me feel better. She was very sweet, funny and professional throughout the whole appointment, listened to what I had in mind, looked at the pics I had for vague reference and created my vision with 100% accuracy. My god. I've never been so in love with myself. Everyone- even my fairly conservative parents- say it's gorgeous and is totally ME. 
It's been a week now and I've washed it twice- color is still a strong aqua/teal. -love- And people are STILL complimenting me. 
This place is as laid back as everyone says. Like a tattoo shop for your hair. Will forever come back.
The prices are VERY fair for the skill these women have. My particular color and style took 4 hours.

I needed to get a mani-pedi before vacation and stopped by Color Nail Spa because I had received a gift certificate for Christmas. I got a Spa Plus pedicure which, I thought was great and well worth the extra money. I also got a standard manicure. My nail tech suggested I get gel because I was going to the beach and it would last longer. I didn't feel like he was trying to up-sell me on it or pushy about it. He was just very honest that my regular polish would likely chip within a few days at the beach.  I appreciated his honesty. And while I agreed about the gel, I opted to stick with regular polish knowing full well that I'll probably have to touch it up myself. At the end of the day, a regular polish manicure just isn't going to be as long lasting as a gel or acrylic manicure. That's why it's $17 instead of $37. ?

The salon itself was nice, clean and everyone was friendly enough while not being overly pushy to chat when I had my head buried in my phone scanning Facebook and checking emails. I'd recommend this salon for a standard mani-pedi situation - location is great - tons of parking and I thought reasonable prices.

I am extremely afraid of the dentist ever since I was younger and had a cavity filled while I could still feel it. That dentist didn't seem to care & told me I would be okay. It's been over 10 years since I've had any work done on my mouth. I was in constant pain this past week & could barely open my mouth to eat. I found Royal Highlands off of yelp & I'm so glad I came here. The doctor told me I had an impacted & infected wisdom tooth and I should get it removed soon. The whole front desk staff was so kind and helpful throughout everything, especially Jasmine. The day of my extraction they made me feel comfortable and did everything they could to ease my nerves. Dr. Ho let me listen to music to relax and extracted my tooth in less than 5 minutes. I would recommend Royal Highlands to anyone!! 

Thank you all for making this dental experience better than my last one!

Recommended by a friend from my hometown and thought I'd give it a try. Food and drinks were great! Potato salad was like nothing I've tasted before...so good! Highly recommend the caramel milkshake. Max, our server, was so friendly and helpful! He made sure we were enjoying our time and was very good at checking up on us. The guy refilling water and taking dishes was so sweet too. They were also able to adjust a meal to my friend's allergy and gluten free requests! If you're in Vegas go to the Venetian hotel (the restaurant is inside by the casinos) for lunch or dinner here...so worth it.

Wiseys is exactly what the Leaside area needed!  The meat pies are reasonably priced and are deliciously filling (I bought some for a family brunch and they were a huge hit!).  They also have an impressive selection of sweet and savoury baked goods - i.,e  savoury and blueberry scones are very flavourful and fresh, and the cinnamon donuts are addictive.  I also tried a flat white (coffee) for the first time, and I am now a big fan.  

A really lovely cafe with adorable decor and very friendly staff.  I always look forward to stopping in.

A really lovely, family-friendly bakery with the most wonderful staff!  I'm not normally a fan of cream puffs, but the ones at Mon K are delicious - a light pastry with a silky, creamy filling.  Not too sweet and not heavy at all.  Their sandwiches are also tasty (I tried the Croque Monsieur and the Egg salad croissant) and make for a satisfying lunch.  Prices are also very reasonable considering the exceptional quality of the goods.  Looking forward to trying some of their other creations!

Appetizers were cooked to perfection.  The spider roll was made with a very generous portion of tasty soft shell crab - certainly one of the best I've had.  Sushi was very fresh and really did seem to melt in your mouth.

Although my husband and I were stuffed, we curiously eyed the Mandarin Pie on the menu and shared that as well.  Surprisingly light and a good end to a very satisfying meal.  

Next time I will order the omakase.  Can't wait!

This is by far my favourite Longos store - clean,  friendly staff and fresh produce.  I recently ordered a cake from the bakery for my daughter's birthday party and was so impressed by the quality.  It was visually appealing, fresh and delicious!  Even the pickiest eaters and harshest critics (adults and children) at the party had only wonderful things to say.  It was also very reasonably priced.

Tasty grilled cheese sandwiches in a friendly neighbourhood setting.  My favourites are the Rise & Shine (bacon, scrambled egg, tomato, cheese) and Green Machine (avocado, arugula, pesto, cheese).  If you have room for a little indulgence, also try the grilled banana & nutella sandwich (yum!).  

The owners are very friendly and accommodating.  The establishment is also very kid-friendly.  Board games are available, and the owners even put on a movie for my nieces as a pleasant distraction as we waited for our orders.  Wonderful!

Listen, we went to this place and successfully bought booze, let's not exaggerate. But I have never been in a retail establishment that smelled quite like this. I don't know if a sewage line recently ruptured, or if there's a sulfur issue, but this place smells like a dirty diaper ate a burrito and took a dump into another dirty diaper. It smells like an outhouse next to a cemetery next to an abattoir. It smells like death and sadness.

But come here for cheap booze!

During our recent trip to Las Vegas, we decided to go to the Spice Market buffet as we had coupons and we had heard good things already.We didn't know that only one coupon could be used per ticket. The front desk people were very rude to us for no reason and after everything was explained to the manager, he proceeded to ask if we were going to eat breakfast or not like his staff being rude wasn't a priority. So we left and didn't get the chance to try anything.

I went two days ago for a simple tire tube for my beach cruiser. We installed the tube yesterday and realized immediately it wasn't holding air. Tested the tube under water to find it had a small hole. Brought the tube and original box in today, hoping they'd be kind enough to replace due to the damaged product in which the guy working stated they wouldn't be able to replace and I would have to buy a new one. No kind customer service stating it may have been a preexisting damage from the manufacturing company or anything to keep a customer from returning. I will get my tube elsewhere where they may be friendly enough to replace.

I thought this was a very good place if you're in the mood for pizza, salad, or sandwiches. Pizzas are all 10", server stated "thin crust" however I would say more original/pan crust. 

Wings were just okay, nothing to write home about. Great salad, small size is definitely big enough for a meal or to split with someone + a pizza. 

Will be returning when in the area for a fresh pizza and salad

Great authentic Indian food. Was very skeptical of ordering Indian food as most of Indian restaurants serve tasteless Americanized version of Indian food but this restaurant delivered food to my hotel, on time with perfect amount of masala. Tried goat biryani and dal makhni. If you are Indian looking to revive Dhaba taste buds, look no further.

Panels were installed within 4 months of signing contract, but system took about a year to get running. Responses to emails and calls to them would take weeks to receive a reply. There were problems with getting approvals from APS or the HOA or someone else.  After months of excuses from them, I finally  left a message to our agent to come take the panels off and to cancel the contract . The agent had someone else return my call and we decided to go ahead  and keep the system. They managed to send someone out the next day, but he was 2 hours late for the appointed time and didn't bother to call. Overall it has been a bad experience.  I should have just canceled.

Went for lunch. Had the rare beef plus beef balls pho and the boyfriend had the tomato and crab meat noodles. 
Both bowls came steaming hot which was very nice (and rare!) but not sure if that's the reason why my rare beef came pretty well done. The soup is flavourful though! I didn't try the tomato and crab noodles, though my boyfriend said it tasted good. 
We sat at one of the booths, so it felt spacious inside the restaurant. Service was friendly. Would come back!

Great decor. Waiter was friendly and helpful. Food delicious. Pretty expensive for the portions given (even though it's tapas, the portions are still pretty small for the price). For example, the pimentos were good but there were probably 8 little peppers in the small bowl ($9 if I remembered correctly). Tried several tapas dishes, really liked the pepper stuffed with manchego and oxtail. The assorted jamon plate is good too!  Not a big fan of the bacon wrapped dates. All in all, it was a good experience.

Hip decor, reasonable prices and most importantly FRESH ingredients! What more can one ask for? 

This place has more of a casual fare. You order at the cashier next to the sushi chefs; sit at a table on a stool, and they'll bring you your order along with wooden chopsticks, paper plates and paper cups of water. 

The place seems pretty small and has about 4 communal tables. However, We (group of 6) went at around 2pm on a Saturday and had no trouble finding seats at all. 

Though casual, presentation of the food was pretty!

If you don't live around the area, this place wouldn't catch your eyes and thus harder to find (in the papa chang's plaza). 

I would definitely come back! Next time for their rice bowls! (All under $15!!). Would be a nice choice for a casual date night!

Didn't have enough time to eat in, so I had to get take out fish and chips.
Ordered the haddock and chips. Price was reasonable. 
The fish: very crispy and tasted fresh. The batter was in the salty side but very flavourful. 
The chips: thick cut and good. 
The tartar sauce was the only thing I didn't like. Not sure if it was because I ordered take-out, the tartar sauce was prepackaged (like ketchup packs), and was not so good. Hopefully if I eat-in next time, they'll offer fresh house-made tartar sauce!

I'm a seafood lover so I was excited to finally try buster's sea cove in the st Lawrence market! There's always a line up there every time I went to the market and this time (a Saturday) there was one as well. Seating was limited, but being there at around 2pm, I was able to find two seats. Even with a line, it didn't take long for the boyfriend to put down an order, so don't be afraid to line up!! 

We recently came back from a trip to Seattle and just loved the clam chowder at pike place market. So, we ordered the New England clam chowder and the haddock fish and chips. 

* New England clam chowder: pike place still takes first place!! But this one at buster's is pretty good. You can taste the clams although it got kind of watery half way through. It didn't feel very hearty to me as there wasn't many chunks of clams or potatoes or what have you. Though, It's a pretty decent chowder. 

* Haddock and chips: I'm not a big fan of the fish and chips here at buster's. The batter is light, but it doesn't have much taste to it. The batter was also not crispy. The haddock itself, is a little dry. I was expecting it to be a tougher texture, but it shouldn't feel dry. Also not much seasoning. Kind of reminds me of fish filets/fish sticks that come in a box in the frozen aisle. The fries, were definitely not made fresh (even with the lineup?!). They weren't crispy nor too soggy. Saving grace was their tartar sauce, it tasted home made and gave the fish some flavour. It also comes with a little container of slaw. 

All in all, my experience here at buster's st Lawrence market was only so-so (food wasn't as fresh and service was a little rushed). Maybe I just had high expectations! Might give the other menu items a try next time.

The food is very very good! The restaurant  decor and atmosphere is clean and pretty. I'm not a big meat person but the coffee brisket I loved! Everything on that dish was good: the cole slaw, the corn bread! The boyfriend had the fried honey chicken (spicy) and it was really good too. The chicken is moist on the inside and very crispy on the outside. The corn that came with it was very tasty as well! I didn't get to try the dessert because I had to leave early, but my sister had the crime brûlée and she said it was amazing! Will definitely go back!

This is my second time at scaddabush. I remember the first time was a good experience. This time....was also good! Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. Food was yummy as well. We ordered the carbonara pasta, a pizza, and a few sides. The carbonara was pretty good. There was an egg on top, but it didn't feel like there was egg in the sauce (and thus I felt it was not creamy enough). Pizza was alright. The side dishes were good except for the rosemary fries. I thought that there could've been more rosemary flavour to it. (Note: after we finished the fries, we then realized that the seasonings were all on the bottom of the bowl the fries came with!! So, hint: toss your fries before you devour!). We also had one of the salads (the Tuscan salad?) and it was very flavourful. 
All in all, dinner at Scaddabush was a good experience! The setting was nice and seating was comfortable. One small thing I would've liked: complimentary bread!! ;)

Pho mi is so far the best Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. I'm not a huge pho fan, but their pho makes me crave it sometimes! No matter what noodle soup you order, it'll be full of taste with lots of ingredients. You'll leave feeling very full and satisfied for sure. Prices are also reasonable. Restaurant isn't fancy at all and service isn't extremely friendly too, but the food is what makes me come back! 
The broth in the pho is very flavourful, but I find that the "specialty noodles" are the best! Recently tried the chicken curry noodles and it was so good! Doesn't taste too heavy at all!

Went during the unionville festival and although it was 10pm, there was still a long lineup. We had the mochi, taro ice cream and Sakura no-bake cheesecake.

Big tip: if you're NOT getting the original flavour cheesecake, then you DO NOT need to line up. There was this lady in line that rudely accused me of butting in line, when there was a sign that clearly says that the line is only for the original cheesecake. So, remember not to be that person! ;) We're all there to have good food, no need to be rude! Just read the signs posted on their store front!

Ok back to the food!

The Mochi (2.50$): We ordered the black sesame Mochi but the girl gave me the red bean instead :'(. It's made with actual sticky rice! So it wasn't that sweet and kind of a little savoury in fact! Wasn't what I expected! It was interesting.

The taro ice cream ($4.50): the first spoon of taro ice cream brought me back to childhood memories of having taro ice cream in HK!! Which means it was very good, albeit a bit on the sweeter side. It comes in a plastic bowl with lid, not bad for price. 

Sakura no-bake cheesecake ($8): it has a nice tart cheesy taste, with graham crumbs on the bottom. It tasted good, but I couldn't really taste the Sakura. It looks very pretty though!!

this is one of my family's go-to dim sum restaurants. We don't come here often though because of the long waits for a table. What draws us back, is the cha Siu here. It's a must!! For under $9 you get fresh and tasty cha Siu, big portion with a bowl of rice on the side! Other dim sum are pretty good too. 
Other than the long waits for a table, another little nuisance is the parking here. Never turn into the little plaza where the restaurant is, because there's no space reserved for the restaurant itself! The spaces there are all reserved for other stores in the plaza. So, drive into where the keg is and park there instead, then walk up the small slope to get to the restaurant.

Unlike usual Greek spots, you walk into Main Street Greek and you feel comfortable. The decor is simple yet fresh. It's a small restaurant but it feels spacious, so it's nice and quaint. 

Prices aren't bad but not cheap. Food was fresh, which is a high priority for me. 

We tried one of the dips, the pork souvlaki dinner, and the spanakopita. Warm garlic bread was served once we ordered, along with a bottle of tap water. 

The pork souvlaki was the tastiest out of the three items. Very tender and juicy! The dip came with warm pita bread, yum! The spanakopita, though, was a bit cold and hard. 

All in all, it was a nice experience. Food was good and service was friendly. Plus they serve some of the foods on pretty plates!!

My daughter and I have looked everywhere for silver dress shoes for home  comming.  Davids bridal had a pair advertised that they didn't even have and they were rude.  I guess when she does get married we don't  need  to go there!  We went to  Dillards and the shoes were 120.00 so we're were leaving and found focus and the same shoe we wanted at Davids bridal  for 45.00! They were nice to ! Now if they last we will really give them a five and I'll update you. .

I had heard about the new steak house and thought I'd try it. It was packed but I was alone so I thought it might not be that long. I wasn't welcomed and when I asked I was told it would be 45 minutes!  It was extremely loud and there was no where to sit I waited 15 minutes and the noise made me decide to go black Angus where I didn't have to wait and it was a much better atmosphere and after reading comments better food too!

If you are like me and prefer to support local businesses but you want expert knowledge and quality work call Ronnie at Sky Electric. 

First, the owner is such a nice guy you just want to work with him. He and his team clearly take pride in their work and enjoy what they do. They go the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied in a clean and timely manner. I would recommend them to everyone.

We adore this place! We only pick up so I can't speak to the dine in service but it's great when taking away. The food is fresh and seems of higher quality. I also don't notice the excessive sodium that I do with other Asian take out. The sizes are large but not so much you waist. I also like the containers the food comes in. All in all it's our new place.

When i think of eating out in Calgary, Big Fish is all ways an option. Best Burger i have ever had is the lamb/lobster burger. Many, and i mean MANY, great nights of service and food has come from this gem. I have had inconsistent and i have had less then my expectations........ but i have had so many good experiences here and at the joining restaurant Open Range, that i must say " i am drawn here like the eternal Moth to the Eternal light of lights" 

big fish is worth at least 3 tries, if you are not satisfied after 3, i will buy your meal at any other restaurant in the city of Calgary you want...... minus the alcohol bill and to go orders. Just message me with your 3 receipts ready in hand, and we will go for a meal and discuss how wrong you think I am..... Jerk!!!!!

Big fish makes a gourmet Shark ahhhhhhhHHHHH satisfied!!!!! x a million!

For what this place is, it's amazing. The Banh Mi is better at other places, but the Baos, squid taco, grilled chicken papaya salad and the kimchi fries are unique items that set Banh Mi Boys apart. Try the secret menu "Club Bao" (with pork belly & fried chicken). Staff are always high energy and the vibe is good. (There seems to be a West Coast hip hop bias here though, I'm more of an East Coast guy but whatever) If you live or work in urban Toronto this is a place you should frequent often.

Two of us ordered the brisket beef dip sandwich, advertised as a staple item at this place. The meat was too tough to eat out of the sandwich, could only be eaten with a knife and fork after a lot of chewing, the sandwich bread was burnt to a crisp... definitely not a $16 sandwich. 

In combination with this the service was extremely slow, and took a really long time for us to get the bill or refills on anything.

This place has a lot of charm. You can tell the family that runs it is very passionate about what they do. Our server recommended the Cold Sweaty Noodle (I forget the exact name of this dish) it was my favourite of the night, good spice, light, and packed with raw veggies. The broths are definitely different from any other place you will try, but it was an interesting change... not necessarily lacking in flavour as other reviews might suggest, just different. They had a bit more of an acidic flavour. The staff there seemed generally confused and overwhelmed, but they will probably get into the groove of things in a few months. Not one of my top picks, but I look forward to coming back and trying some other items on their menu.

Came for some drinks after seeing a movie at Yonge-Dundas. Really enjoyed the beer samples and the staff were very friendly. Wish they dimmed the lights a bit, it was very bright inside for that time of day. Unfortunately we weren't able to stay long enough because last call was 11 on a Saturday night. Hard to understand, because the place was packed and they only needed one or two staff members to keep it going. May consider this place for daytime drinks in the future, would love to come at night since I live in the neighbourhood but unfortunately they're not open to that type of business.

The margarita pizza they have with a soprassa-stuffed crust changed my life for real. One of the best Neopolitan style pizzas in the city. The rice balls are also my jam. Staff were attentive and had lots of personality. I'm not even Italian at all - but it made me feel like I was at my Nona's house!!

A homeless lady came in and stole a loaf of bread when we were in line, props to that lady! Gotta give credit to Via Mercanti as well for feeding the homeless.

HOLY HOT WAITRESS BATMAN!!!!!!!!! THIS PLACE IS THE SHIZZNIT!!!!!!
So my boy and I saw the travel channel burger special on this joint a week before we went to Vegas and we were all like " YO CUZ WE GOTS TO EATS THESE MEATS". So the morning after our first rage session we  were the first customers in line when it opened. There was also an obnoxious German film crew trying to shoot in their restaurant. After being rude to one of the lovely waitresses and refusing to wear the awesome patients gown we got to experience probably the greatest tongue lashing I've ever witnessed. Dr.Jon came over and told the German douche bags what they could do with the hospital gowns if they didn't like them. Dr. Jon is a true american hero in my opinion because like any good American he knows what happens if you let a pushy German get their way. His vision of american  badassness is a shining beacon of our freedom and should be commended. The burgers, fries, and shakes are  tasty, the waitresses are friendly ,beautiful and playful. If you're downtown you owe it to America to eat here.

  p.s. Dr. Jon if you ever read this know that you are awesome and I am now and forever your biggest fan.  Everyone I ever speak to that is heading to vegas will hear my tale of how my hero Dr. Jon vanquished the snotty Euro film crew sent here to mock our American right to do whatever the f%#ck we want to. I will eat here every time I visit Vegas until I die.


Just revisited this American gem and it was every bit as good as the last time. God bless America and and God bless the good men and women of the Heart attack Grill. Dr. Jon is even more baller than I remember, I'm pretty certain he is the smartest man to ever live.

I loved this place. Easily the most hipsters per square inch of any place in Vegas.  I sat at the bar and watched the NBA playoffs and ordered some brews and a burger. The staff was attentive and engaging but not in a cheesy way. The atmosphere was cordial and inviting with some good talent in the hostess and waitress department. The burger was so outstanding I came back two and a half hours later drunk and ordered the Shepard's pie, which was a life changing experience. If you're in Vegas and want a affordable great meal you should definitely hit this place up.

Ok so this place is no good in my opinion, would give zero stars if I could.  decided to try em out and ordered delivery a while back and when the food was delivered it was cold with hardly any cheese on the pizza, You could clearly see the bread throughout the whole pie. the wings were also cold. And to top it off the salad was soggy and seemed past it's useful date. Pretty much threw out most of the food because it didn't taste good anyway. Didn't even taste the salad for fear of food poisoning. For pretty hefty prices I was definitely expecting better. Big jimmy's is way better for half the price. I felt like I was ripped off. called them, talked to a staff member she assured me a manager would call. Long story short I called and called and never received a call back. Always just an excuse. "I'm not authorized to issue a full or even partial refund, you'll have to wait for a manager to call you" I must have tried 5 or 6 times. I wouldn't spend your money here. Pretty bad when you get beat by $5 pizza. what disappointed me the most was their lack of concern for a paying customer. A customer who has spent lots of money and used to regularly visit philly's bar and grill, which they are affiliated with.

I would not recommend this place. You never know what you'll get at this restaurant. The service is okay but they always seem irritated and pushy.

Very expensive and poor  recommendations, they charge more for the cheap lens so you have to pay for the pointless reflective coatings etc and they say its "a part of the package" bs. My prescription strained my eyes and was aggressive and I can't wear my glasses then after three months of purchase they werent able to offer me anything to change out the lens. Over 150 for a lens I will never use. Insurance won't cover very much of it anyway because it's much more expensive than the 150 to begin with just for a lens.

I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Bridal Beginning. There is such a huge and varied collection of dresses. The ladies there were all so very nice and helpful. I lucked out getting to work with Sam, who after just a few minutes was able to explain my taste and my idea of what I wanted 10 times better than I was able to! We worked our way through a couple dresses, it all started coming together and then there it was! Sam and the other ladies were so warm, helpful and honest and seemed truly happy to have helped me find my dress. Even though I kept them there late! Thanks to you all! Sam, you're wonderful!

As a self-proclaimed beer snob, we were in Toronto to check out the beer scene. Hungry, we finally arrived to Indie Ale House. To our dismay, the kitchen was closed from 3 to 5 pm; however, the greeter suggested Playa Cabana Cantina across the street for some good eats. What a suggestion that turned out to be.

The prices were a little higher for a typical burrito, but in my opinion, I got what I paid for. I ordered the CARNE MOLIDA PICADILLO BURRITO which is home-ground beef slow-cooked with guajillo-ancho-chipotle. The burrito had a beautiful presentation with green ancho-chili sauce poured on one half with a red, tomatoe sauce poured on the other half. Their sauces were fantastic. They also offered two house-made hot sauces. One was a habenero based hot sauce and the other was a hot sauce made from smoked chilis. Both sauces had a great spice. The smoked hot sauce went great with my dish.

My wife bought the Tres taco option - ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS. This took traditional tacos to another level. As mentioned, Playa Cabana has their sauces down. The liquid in which they braised the short rib was no exception. This option paired extremely well with the habenero hot sauce.

If you are in the area and have no problem with $14-18 for a delicious entre, by all means, try it out. (Not to mention Indie Ale House is right across the street with tastey brews for a good night cap.) When in Toronto again, I will defintely come back.

I went there a month ago for a refill ... i showed a picture to my nail technician (Tracy) she said it was very easy to do so i was happy and was looking forward to my new set of nails. It looked nothing like the picture, the nails were so thick and wide (they looked like the 100 layers of polish on them) i went back the next day for her to fix them, i reshowed her the picture and still never got close to what i asked, very disappointed in the quality of work.

I booked a king bed room to celebrate my husband's birthday using Red Rock's own website.  We planned to have dinner at T-Bones and stay the night.  We are locals, so this was supposed to be a nice stay-cation for us.   Upon check-in I was advised by front desk employee Yumi that no king bed rooms were available and we'd have to be happy with a room with 2 queen beds.  Even after showing her my reservation for the king bed room, Yumi advised me that my reservation was simply a "preference."  She even threatened to "call security on us" if we continued to express our dissatisfaction at the refusal to honor our room reservation.  Instead of taking ownership of the shortcoming, Yumi chose to blame me for "misunderstanding" Red Rock's online reservation system, repeatedly talking down to me as if I were too obtuse to understand that even though I booked a room with a king bed for my husband's birthday, my booking was actually only a "preference."  No where was this made clear when I made my reservation using Red Rock's online system.  In addition to Yumi's refusal to simply take ownership of the problem, she then threatened us with "calling security" due to our insistence that Red Rock honor my reservation.  I've lived in Nevada my entire life and have stayed at multiple local and strip area hotels, and have never been treated so poorly by a front desk agent.  Even after all the unpleasantries during the check in, Yumi then placed us in a room that looked directly at the parking garage.  I suppose that was her way of "teaching us."  Although we went on to have a very nice dinner at T-Bones that night, Yumi's behavior toward us soured our entire experience.  We'll go back to staying at JW Marriott for our staycations from now on.

Sienna Mercato is now on my permanent rotation list for my frequent trips to Pittsburgh. It's three levels of great service and delicious food. 

I started with a craft beer and beef tartar in the beer garden. It's a cool area with a clear roof and open terrace. This would be a great place to join a group of friends, drink a little beer and watch a game on the numerous TVs.  One end is open to Penn Ave.

I then moved to the middle level where I had a good red wine and a very good bacon and clam pizza.  I like this level. I really liked the pizza. 

And, sadly, I'm too full to check out the first level. I'll save that for my next trip. 

All in all, it's now in my top 5 in Pittsburgh.

***This review is solely for the Russian masseuse they have at this office. ***

I went in for a massage yesterday because my neck and shoulders were very stiff (I got rear ended a few months ago). As I was lying down, the masseuse placed a heating pad on my lower back. And as she was working on my shoulder / upper back, I noticed that she kept on stopping literally every 2 - 3 seconds (I am NOT exaggerating), and was reaching for something on the heating pad. 
After a few minutes, I finally realized: she had placed her PHONE on my back and was playing with it while giving me a shoulder massage... !!?!?!!! 

Are you speechless? Because I sure was. 

I was in so much disbelief of her unprofessional behavior that I just simply had no idea what to do. 
I finally said "I have somewhere to go, can we end this session short", and got me out of the misery. 

She did not help my symptoms at all whatsoever. This is the 3rd time I've gotten a massage from her, and each session kept getting worse. I have a strong feeling she doesn't like Asians very much. 

Placing your phone on a client's back AND playing with your phone while giving a therapy massage is absolutely unacceptable.

Uniburger is a good Montréal burger joint, well deserving its 4 stars. The bulk of those stars, however, come from the abundant and delicious fries rather than the burger itself.

The burger was good, I am not denying this, HOWEVER, since moving to New York I've had my share of good burgers. Theirs was reminiscent of a lesser Shake Shack burger: it had the same feel, the same basic taste for all basic ingredients (beef patty, tomatoes, lettuce...) but it lacked the delicious Shack sauce which brings it all together and elevates the whole burger.

Still, the whole was very enjoyable - I would definitively recommend it as a spot when rolling through town.

J'adore Juliette & Chocolat. C'est le genre d'endroits, presque un salon de thé, qui manque à New York. Rien que la carte des chocolats chauds m'a soufflée: une petite vingtaine de choix donnés en "single origin" pour mieux déguster la saveur du chocolat... wow.

J'ai aussi essayé tous leurs pots de crèmes (je crois): j'ai adoré le praliné et le caramel salé. Ce dernier était peut-être un peu trop sucré, mais il était en même temps tellement bon...

Leurs desserts n'ont pas la richesse de la Maison du Chocolat, ni la complexité de ceux de Hévin, mais ils sont délicieux tout de même, à leur propre façon.

Gros coup de coeur de Montréal.

Frite alors! c'est la brasserie/friterie belge typique revisitée pour les Québecquois (comprendre "avec poutine"). Comme d'habitude, j'étais un peu sceptique. Les frites, ça doit pouvoir se déguster sans sauce et juste briller par sa qualité en standalone. Après, ça m'empêche pas d'apprécier des sauces, mais toujours dans un petit pot à côté pour pouvoir alterner entre avec et sans sauce. Et puis, du fromage sur des frites? wtf.

Mais j'ai essayé une poutine avec champignons, oignons et boeuf et j'ai changé d'avis. La poutine est, en fait, une idée génial. Le problème c'est qu'elle peut servir à cacher un manque de qualité du produit (les frites par exemple) en la "noyant" sous une masse de trucs. Mais, à Frite alors!, chaque partie de la poutine et la poutine en son ensemble étaient de qualité.

Un excellent souvenir de Montréal.

To be honest, I was disappointed by their bagels. I was told that Montréal bagels could not compare with NY bagels. If I could generalize from this experience, I would say it's true. Ridiculously true.

Places like Ess-a-bagel and Murray Bagels
have ridiculously good sandwiches. Really, I never knew sandwiches could be this good: they are, after all, only slices of stuff between two halves of bread. Those NY bagels elevate sandwiches. By contrast, I got at Fairmount Bagel a simple sandwich. It was good, but there wasn't the the pezzaz that I've come to expect from bagels. Also, the bread was really doughy.

One of the major advantages of this place is that it's cheap: 6,5 CAD for a salmon sandwhich? Yes please! Otherwise, I'll stick to poutine.

I would not recommend this community. The office staff is rude, abrasive and unhelpful. Also they tack on extra fees not in the lease. Upon move out we were advised that they charge a extra $80 "standard cleaning fee" unless we provide a receipt from a professional cleaning company. Neither one of these things are in the lease in any shape or form. They are saying that they charge every single two bedroom unit $80 unless given a receipt. We moved out, meticulously cleaned the unit, passed the move out inspection with flying colors, we were not marked down at all, we were just told we need to pay the $80 "standard cleaning fee" I tried to work with the complex office and advise them thy can't add extra fees that are not in the lease, they refused to help, I tried working with Corporate, they stuck to their guns, they are basically stealing and extra $80 from every tennant at move out, no madder if the unit needs cleaned or not. Stay far from this community.

To start, I'm ONLY giving this place 2 stars because the service wasn't terrible. 

Also, if more people in Phoenix reviewed we could probably avoid most of these overpriced robberies. 

I ordered a cocktail that was actually pretty good. Something with sparkling wine and muddled sage I believe. My Mom had a mango martini. That was also pretty good. They are apparently 'known for their martinis'. Though I find it really hard to believe that they're known for anything. 

As an appetizer we had caprese. It was 12 bucks and came with four tomato slices that were not ripe, four pieces of impostor buffalo mozzarella and a flake of basil. Hands down the worst I have ever had. 

Next came the salads. These were made up of a few greens and half a tomato. Seriously? 

For my entree I ordered a mixed veggie type pasta with oil and garlic. 20 bucks down the drain. My boyfriend had the 'special' which was Cioppino. It was 36 dollars and his stomach is feeling ever dollar of it. 

We took our left overs because we just do that and don't want to be wasteful. On the way home the smell of it was so bad we had to pull over to toss it out. 

This place is a crock. They couldn't get me to eat here again at fast food prices. 

For 4 people (And only 2 cocktails) our bill came out to 180 bucks. What a rip off.

Super surprised to go to a nail salon outside of LA that got what I wanted. It may not be that way with every technician there. But mine was super rad and spent time with me to understand. I'm really picky about my nails. That being said, if you want something super current just be really clear and bring pics. Really great price point. The owner has the most amazing customer service everrrr!!! I went in New Year's Eve.. And there wasn't a taxi that would pick me up. So she personally drove me. That's crazy. Over all it's a basic nail salon with a friendly staff and good price, able to pull off pictures.

Reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I waited 30 plus minutes for my scheduled appointment and they were understaffed. 

Overall awesome though.

I've not only found this storage facility's rates reasonable in comparison with many other facities rates, but, in my experience, the people who work their have shown a very helpful, friendly and customer-friendly attitude. Without anyone's breaking rules or requesting things that are against the rules, Rohil Patel there, at the Cubesmart Miles Road, Warrensville Hts location, have been helpfully accommodating. I am especially grateful to two young employees, Rohil Patel and Angelo Nici, for the help they gave me in a very near closing time. They were all smiles while doing their job and while helping me.

I might add that this facility has been safe and secure and very clean. I've encountered no shady characters lurking around, nor have I seen any signs of storage areas having been damaged or broken into. It's very nice to feel safe and secure about one's person or belongings. Thanks, again, to the facility and to the staff.

Our first and our last time eating here. I had a "Chile relleno" the menu said light fluffy batter, I got a hard green chile in an omelet. It was NOT good at all! Our waiter was ridiculous.  We saw him 3x the entire time we were seated. I had to flag him down to get the bill. It's ashame, Lake Las Vegas is a beautiful place to visit.  Next time we'll just get some gelato and call it dinner!

This has to be the worst lounge I've ever been in. We had to clear the dishes from a table first of all so we could sit. The place was so over crowded as to be a joke for a business class perk. The food is next to non existent. The only thing it has going for it is free booze which is only good for the real boozers in the crowd. For the price you pay for business class, especially international they could do a lot better.

My penne was swimming in cream when it was no supposed to be. No pesto flavour to be had as it was pesto penne advertised, mushroom was so thinly sliced could not even taste it in all that cream, no flavour at all. The waitress did not seem interested to help me out here, she was 'sorry'. No happy hour, no half litre of wine - skip this location!

Love the tea here. You will not want to go back to Panera tea after you've had the brewed mint tea. Iced tea is just as good. I don't know what he does or puts in it but this man knows his tea. 

The food is simple, a little plain but good. Never gotten fries here but the hummus is smooth and has a nice flavor with good quality olive oil, the pitas are warm and fresh (and you get  two so they will fill you up) and I actually like the kufta here better than Layalina's which is saying something because I love that place (but am not a fan of their kufta). Lentil soup is also tasty and filling. The  falafel does leave something to be desired.

I also don't mind the guy behind the counter. If you absolutely must be kowtowed to with fake enthusiasm and mock-pleasure to serve you this is not your place. This guy smiles at you its genuine.

Dom's has closed, it is true, but the word on the street is the family will be opening a new restaurant, called Butitta's (Dom's last name) at the location of the old now-closed Jillian's on Neil sometime in early 2009 (at least that's what the phonebook ad said). They said they'd still have some old familiar items on the menu but would have new stuff too. So keep an eye out for Butitta's!

UPDATE 11/20/2009: They have a banner outside the building announcing they are now hiring servers and will be opening soon! WOO!

Tried this for the first time. They've added about a half dozen more tables, have some privacy screens up, decor is cute. Workers were earnest and ready to help. I had the mango green tea and it was tasty, not too sweet, hint of green tea flavor and the jelly was soft and fresh. Only three bucks for a medium too. Service only took a few minutes, no line, just steady customers, few people sitting down. No complaints here!

A coworker told me this place was better than Layalina, and them's fightin' words, so off I went for lunch.

Interior is nice, airy spacious, a bit loud and echoey with upstairs seating. Not exactly a cozy intimate dinner spot, still retains that fast-foody 'get in, eat, get out' atmosphere of most places on Green.

In order to get a good cross-sample I ordered the mixed grill. Wait was a solid 15 minutes, and there was a steady trickle of customers the whole time (during spring break, I imagine they will be busier during school). The menu said they had hot tea but I saw none in evidence, just a soda fountain, cold bottle drinks behind the counter, and an iced tea server.

Got the food to go and got back to the office. The chicken (shish tawook) was perfectly done, which for white meat at an understaffed restaurant (they had help wanted signs in the window) is a mark in their favor. The beef was also well done and mildly flavorful but not quite the explosion of spiciness that Layalina provides. The kufta kabob was also mild and well-cooked. Nothing was dry or tasteless, the pita bread was fresh, the two sides they give you, one was some kind of jerusalem salad that was 90% tomatoes so I passed on it after taking one bite for review purposes (yup, tomtaoey. Yuck. The things I do for you people) and the other was this odd, neon-pink pickled... something. Not cabbage, not radish, not sure what it was. Its not on the menu. I ate it anyway. It was... pickled radishy but not too strong. Serving sizes were more than enough for lunch unless you're super hungry, I was and still felt full about halfway in but it was good enough that by picking at it over the course of an hour I managed to finish everything but the pita.

The rice was a little on the oily side but good if again, not as spiced as Layalina. All in all this was a nice, freshly-cooked, healthy meal for a great price. I've heard the owners are Afghani so its possible the food is a milder form than I'm used to. Either way it was fresh, hot, tasty and a great deal for the price. I wouldn't do a dinner date here or anything but for a casual nice lunch or dinner that's not the same fast food fare, I definitely recommend it.

This is owned by the old original cook/owner of Tang Dynasty in Lincoln Square Mall. If you ever wonder what happened to the food there, it was this: the cook sold it and left. He's now opened a new place and the food's just as good as I remembered it. 

Had the dry-fried string beans, some stir-fried beef and mixed veg dish, the mix platter appetizer and some beef noodle soup. All were quite flavorful and tasty, and not too oily (something that happens often in this town with Chinese food, sadly). Could not stop eating the green beans, even my four year old liked them. For those who use this metric for their Chinese restaurants: every other patron there was native Chinese, both students and older folk. Parking is free, easy and plentiful. 

As others have said, the interior is the exact same (they even still have the beanbag toss game out on the patio and the 'lucky' rock in the lobby from when it was Rock's) just with a bunch of tables thrown in but I'm sure that'll change as it gets established.
The serving staff was efficient (might have to point at the menu item you're ordering) and quick with the food, which was piping hot and obviously freshly made, and quite friendly with my son when he practiced his Chinese on them. 

All in all a nice time, excellent authentic food, easy parking close to campus and convenient hours. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

The bread here is so good. Got the baguette from a place that sources their bread from Pekara and froze it. Reheated it in the oven two days later (16m on 375,  if you're wondering) and it was so good I just ate it plain. Made the best garlic bread from the rest. One star removed for sloooooow service and rather overpriced selections of other things, but man their pastries are good. Sandwiches can be hit or miss and heavy. Ambiance is typical locally-owned college town coffee shop, with eclectic furnishings and local art on the walls etc. Outdoor patio seating is great for nice days. Very walkable location, not so much driveable, parking is limited and metered.

Tried the lunch buffet (takeout). Cheaper than other Indian places in the area but due to the small location size less variety of food as well (half the buffet table is salad bar/dessert/sauces), so it evens out. Nice touch: they weigh the buffet takeout, so you don't have to pay the full price if you don't load up.

Naan: just ok, but I did get takeout so it might've suffered a bit in transit. Naan is best fresh and hot.

veggie korma: very good, nicely spicy, good flavor, vegetables were good quality.

pekora: nicely crunchy even after sitting in a styrofoam box for a few minutes, little salty.

palak chana: good, nicely spicy and flavorful, right thickness of sauce

kidney bean chickpea thing I forget the name of: kind of bland, I usually expect more fire in this dish.

tandoori chicken: not great, surprisingly. It was dry and surprisingly hot (spice wise) while being less flavorful than I'm used to. Maybe it'd just been sitting around for awhile (its hard to make dark meat dry!)

lemon rice: yellow rice with fried peanuts in it. I liked the peanuts, gave it a nice crunch, but didn't really taste anything else flavor wise; could've just been plain old basmati rice.

chicken curry: ok, this is why this place dropped a full star. The chicken curry is bone in, which would be fine if it were whole bone, but the bone is cleaver-chopped, which leaves tiny shards of barely-detectable bone EVERYWHERE. Seriously I was picking through this thing like I was dissecting in a lab to make sure I didn't kill myself with every bite. I don't even remember how it tasted. I realize this is 'authentic' but so is using a cow-dung oven to make naan and I'm betting they don't do that. Debone your chicken curry, you're gonna get sued.

The interior decor is really quite nice (a huge change from when it was Wonderdogs, you won't recognize the place), the music wasn't too loud, there was a refreshing lack of tv blaring in the corner, the proprietors are very nice and conscientious, and things were moving along well in such a tight space (you're not going to like it at lunch rush if you're claustrophobic/have a phobia of strange people bumping up against/brushing by you). The vegetarian dishes are better than the meat dishes, and I didn't try everything available on the lunch buffet (two or three more items, a lentil soup, desserts (mango custard sounds really good but I didn't want to mingle flavors).

Feels like the vegetarian dishes were better than the meat-based ones, and there is plenty of vegetarian on offer. Wish they'd add samosas to the buffet. Overall I'd recommend it if you want Indian buffet but don't want/don't have time to leave campus, just avoid the chicken curry, especially if you're feeding kids or something.

This place is nice, always busy  (its also a gym), the therapists are friendly, listen well, joke around with you, but really know their stuff. The Mettler Release Technique is freaking magical. I have adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) and had surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff which may well have caused or contributed to it, and Jeff (mentioned in the review above) decided to give MRT a try. 

The effects were immediate; keep in mind this shoulder had been affected for two+ years, and suddenly  after only a few minutes of manipulation I was able to move it further than I'd been able to before with much much much less pain, and this improvement didn't go away after a few hours as it often did with conventional massage. I would strongly recommend anyone with mobility issues due to scar tissue who is considering surgical intervention to at least try this first. I was a complete skeptic going in. I'm writing Paul Mettler a fan letter now.

This is my go-to place for organic and pastured meats. Prices are better than Strawberry Fields, sometimes by an order of magnitude, the selection is usually wider and they are less likely to be sold out of the stuff I want. Produce is pretty nonexistent yes, they sell out of milk fast but if you're in need of sugar substitutes or hard to find herbs and spices they are awesome (check back in the back by the bulk foods).

Also the lunch counter makes awesome sandwiches and very good Thai food (owner's husband is Thai and used to operate one of the best restaurants in Bloomington, I think it was). I like the noodle soups especially.

This store is dangerous for people who like camping gadgets. I am one of those people. I can never get out of here without some doohickey that I never realized existed before I walked in yet now cannot live without. 

They have all your typical outdoor brands but the prices are a bit... pricey (fifty bucks for a kid's windbreaker, really? REALLY?) I will forgive them for this because they have ALL THE SMARTWOOL. ALL OF IT. Seriously if you have not bought smartwool socks before do yourself a favor, wait for them to go on sale and just buy them. Especially this last winter I lived in smartwool socks and tights and the medium-weight hiking socks are so thick and comfortable I use them as slippers.

Anyway the sales people have always been helpful and friendly if a little harried on busy days, and if the person you're asking doesn't know something they know who to ask (go on weekends if you're looking for the hard-core grizzled mountain men type guys who know all the knots in the world and how to arm wrestle a bear).

These guys are great, very good with kids, eyewear selection is wide and they do free refittings (which is great when your 8 year old is as rough on his glasses as mine is).

Dr. Leon as mentioned previously is a man who obviously loves his job, and takes the time to explain all the stuff to curious kids who ask a million questions. He even managed to diagnose an issue in my left eye that had never before been diagnosed and explained it to me in a way I could understand (and also why lasik couldn't fix it). 

They take all kinds of insurance (including university insurance) so you should be covered. The offices are lovely and cozy. They have all the bells and whistles your heart could desire if you're that kind of patient, but they also do standard eye exams and are open on Saturdays as well. I've managed to be seen same day after accidentally splashing toilet bowl cleaner in my eye and my kid managing to take a blow to the eye during a soccer game, same level of service as other days of the week.

Very very happy with this place and its doctors.

This place is apparently a hugely famous Korean coffee chain that's all over Southeast Asia and was brought here to cater to the foreign Asian student population. I got the Thai milk bubble tea and it was certainly... milky. There was a Thai iced tea flavor/color to it, I'll give them that, dunno how well it mixes with tapioca pearls, and for the price I'll go across the street to Basil Thai. Everything in here was hilariously expensive. I got a blueberry muffin that could have been purchased at Sam's Club by the pallet for the same level of quality. The place is clean, the uniforms are cute, and I'm sure the homesick ex-pats will keep it in business, but for those prices vs. quality I'll be going elsewhere.

Two words: food poisoning. ACUTE food poisoning. Knew I should have trusted my instincts when I saw them prepping food on the same cutting board they had just cut raw meat on. Food was pre-cooked and reheated and still tasted overly salty and the wait was ridiculous (said 10m, waited over 20). This is the second time I've given this place a chance and the second disappointment. Won't be a third.

Love their pho, best on or off campus. I still remember the first time I had it, I was stuffed to bursting but still had a bowl of that delicious broth left and I honestly felt guilty about throwing it out. The rest of Thai food is serviceable but I only come for the pho. 

Word of warning: in the cold winter months this place is FREEZING because of a combination of the heavy foot traffic leaving the doors constantly open and the location in the mini mall. The doors face right into the wind which is funneled right down that corridor like a wind tunnel.  The inside is also always cramped and packed though turnover is quick so tables tend to open up regularly. I would do takeout a lot more if it wasn't such a hassle for pho (multiple containers to separate the noodles/broth/garnish and you need a big Chinese soup bowl to put it in once you get where you're going). 

The folks behind the counter are great friendly but busy so don't expect a lot of chitchat at lunch rush. They do speak Thai and you will get major brownie points if you can summon up a friendly sawat dee or kup kum krap/kah.

Wonderful pizza, wonderful people. If you are a Chicago native and like stuffed pizza, order here. If you are not a Chicago native and don't know wtf a stuffed pizza is, order from here. Know that you will be waiting 40 minutes. They make it when you call, none sitting around. I'd pick it up, the drivers will go just about anywhere but you're adding on delivery time that you could be spending eating fresh hot pizza. This is not a sit down place, its counter only, but the owners are pleasant and chatty, the place spotless, and the pizza is awesome. Try the dessert pizza too.

Enterprise's customer service blew us away.  We arrived on Easter Sunday to a clean facility, short line and speedy assistance.  The counter rep was friendly and helpful,  and we were welcomed with a courteous greeting and bottles of cold water when we went downstairs to pick up our car.  Another rep showed us several cars  to choose from and answered our questions with patience and professionalism.  Returning the car was just as easy.

I removed one star because the rep made a point of emphasizing that Arizona is a "no-fault" state and we'd be liable for lost use of the car if it landed in the shop, regardless of whether the other driver was at fault.  With over $200 in added insurance and a $10 a day upgrade, our original weekly rental of $197 burgeoned into well over $525.  

I don't blame Enterprise - we should have researched our liability in advance.  But they do prey upon travelers' anxiety when they're eager to hit the road and start their vacations.  It's a scam.

If you have never tried laser or are just looking for a laser place look no further than Simply Skin! This place is amazing from the staff to the laser. I moved from California and was in need of a laser place and I stumbled upon Simply Skin. I was nervous but it has been the best decision I have made. They are super nice there and make you feel super comfortable. Let's talk about the laser machine now. It is painless and has gives you results!

Avoid this place and Avoid hairstylist Irina!!! Save your money. I asked for layers and my hair was butchered and uneven! This is what I ended up with. Who cuts someone's hair like that! I also had my bottom ends dyed grey and no grey was noticeable. I ended up with orange/copper hair. I called to speak to the manager I was told I would have to wait a week to speak to the manager!  Wtf!

This place is the best for shoe repairs. Brought In a pair of Jimmy Choo's and Manolo's and they made them both look like new, including new soles and polish, etc.  I was ready to throw them both away they looked so bad. They also do a great job of putting rubber soles on brand new shoes that don't already have them (to avoid slips) and it doesn't take away from the look of the shoe. Highly recommend this place.

We came for the Sunday brunch.  It's expensive but you can skip lunch after eating here.  Great variety - typical breakfast food like omelets , a variety of cheeses, breads and fruit but also has crepes and nice salads.  They also bring six different meats to your table - the Chicken Parmesan was my favorite (even better than the beef).  It costs $30 per person - I would recommend this for a nice brunch with lots of variety.

I walked in here to try it and had a Greenhouse Juicery bottle in my hand and I was asked to put it away.  Please.  I was immediately irritated.  In no way was my juice going to take away from the business I gave to you - until you said that.  Then I ordered less simply because of the rudeness.  Your food is nowhere in the same league so you should take whatever business you can get and be glad anyone stops in.

My husband and I came here for appetizers and drinks only.  Reasonably priced, nice interior, accommodating waitress, and food was pretty good.  It wasn't anything fantastic but I'd return for a decent meal.  The drinks we ordered were small, however, and not that much bigger than a shot glass it seemed.  Maybe it was just the type of drink we ordered but the glasses were quite small.

This buffet is amazing.  Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth the splurge.  I recommend that you look at everything first and then decide what to get, because you can't possibly try everything.  I missed an entire corner of great food that I didn't see at first, and then I was too full to eat more. I like how everything is on little plates, bowls, or baskets, so everything doesn't get mixed together.  Lines are long, but you can check in and then they text when your time is almost up.  The wait time was less than they had said it would be, so don't go far away to wait.

I wish I had read the reviews prior to hiring this company to conduct an estate sale at my two vacation houses that are located side by side.  DO NOT use this company!  An estate sale is usually held at a time of stress, death, or moving to a retirement home, when you are vulnerable. That was not my situation, but she CANNOT BE TRUSTED with your family belongings!  Both houses were complete turn-key rentals with all furniture, décor, household goods, linens, etc.  Some of the items were exquisite, especially compared to the other sales shown on her website. There was a mix of things and various quality and values.  I had already conducted three of my own estate sales for other vacation homes that my company was emptying out, and I didn't have time to do another sale. I made a lot of money at my own sales, and I know what stuff sells and what doesn't.  I am also an avid estate/garage sale shopper, so I do know prices. I was going out of town, so I thought this was a great idea - WRONG!  I feel scammed and robbed.  So many things went wrong -- I can't possibly list them all here.  Numerous people told me later that they had been at the sale and said it was very disorganized, nothing was priced, she was on the phone all the time, was just stuffing money into her overalls and not accounting for anything at all!  She doesn't say what she sold major items for (even though I had set minimum prices), provides no accounting whatsoever, and she brought over a lot of her own JUNK to sell.  I think she keeps stuff left over from other sales  (she says she donates it), and then she sells it and pockets the money herself, mixing up the funds of her clients.  Damage was done to both houses from people moving furniture, the carpets were filthy, and items were stolen, including a fixture from the shower!  There were only 3 people working both houses and she had told me there would be 5 -- 2 people at each house, plus herself.  How else could you make sure people weren't stealing stuff, if there is no one there watching?!  Something doesn't add up about this company, and I cannot believe she is still in business.  She also doesn't tell you what the extra fees will be for signs, email blasts, etc.  Very deceptive.

I live in Las Vegas, and last week I stayed at the Palms for 3 nights for a "staycation".  I made the reservation online and paid with a credit card.  When I checked in, I was told that because I am a local, they thought I might be having a PARTY in the room, so there would be a $250 PER NIGHT security deposit, for a total of $750.  I am a single 58 year old woman, not a 21 year old party animal!  The $750 was charged to my credit card, not as a hold, but as an actual charge, and it will take several days after check-out to be credited back to my card.  I did not rent a big suite and the room I had was certainly not big enough to have a party.  The Palms is known for their big party suites--why else would you rent a big party suite if you were NOT going to have a party?  According to their logic, locals might have a party in their room, but tourists pack 6 guests in their basic small room and that is NOT a party?  It's the tourists that come here to party!  If I wanted to have a party, I would have it at my house, not a small hotel room with no refrigerator!  Why was the security deposit $250 PER NIGHT?  Obviously, when the maid cleaned the room after the first and second day, she could see that I had not had a party there the night before.  I am thoroughly insulted and will not stay at the Palms again for my next staycation.  Also, the resort fee of over $30 is a joke.  I know all the hotels here do it, but why is that legal?  Since it is not an optional charge, it should be part of the room rate.  It doesn't even include decent WiFi.  You have to pay extra to get faster than a 1 mg speed.

Oh man, the interior of this place needs a Gordon Ramsay make over.  It kind of looks more like an office rather than restaurant.  I ordered take out, and the food was surprisingly delicious.  Bhuna gosht and Daal masala were great with the garlic naan.  The basmati rice (ordered seperately) was also very flavorful.  If anything, the lamb was slightly overpriced for the portion.  This place needs more customers!! Gotta try it!

I was really looking forward to this but it was a slight let down.  Most of the food was good.  Asian food section and meat selection were great. Seafood area was very limited compared to what was advertised on yelp and their website.  For $50.99 per person on a Saturday night, I would rather be at The Buffet at The Wynn with beautiful flower arrangments surrounding me.

This is my favorite breakfast place in town and it never fails me.  Service is always top notch.  I like sitting at the counter watching the food come out.  If you feel like indulging, try the Monte Cristo. Its a turkey, ham, and swiss sammy in french toast batter deep fried.  Dipped in syrup and you're in heaven!!  If you feel like a healthier option, go for the Veggie Benny.  Avocado, spinach, grilled tomatoes, two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise.  One of the best benedicts I've ever had!

Just perfect for my random kabob cravings.  The KGB is to die for!!! Two juicy koobideh kabobs on a big flat bread with onions, grilled tomato, and a ton of fresh basil($9.99 ).  I noticed when I dined in the food was on the slower side of coming out.  I prefer ordering ahead and picking up.  Mmm can't wait to be back!

We recently had an amazing catering experience for our 75 person party with Mykonos Grill. This was the first time we hosted such a large event and Peter clearly showed that his primary concern was the success of our party. He was extremely helpful, offering lots of tips on how to best serve and arrange the food with so many people, and never made us feel rushed anytime we stopped by or called with a question. The food was delivered on time and was a huge hit with our guests, everything was delicious! We've dined in the restaurant before as well and both the service and food were excellent. We couldn't recommend this restaurant enough.

Hit or miss. I used these guys twice in a day and the cab out was great! Called them when I needed to be picked up and was told 20-30. I waited 55 minutes and then saw the cab cruise by not even looking for a pick up and no stop, no call nothing. So I call the dispatch to let them know and listend to the driver flat out lie to dispatch that I was not there to pick up. Dispatch told me I had to wait for another cab because the one that just drove by was unavailable.  He was sitting at the light on the other side of the lot. On top of that, $20 to go 4 miles? I'll be renting a car tomorrow.

You will be hard pressed to find a better burger.  The menu has changed recently, I recommend over other similar sports bars.  ThIs location and the rock hill location really care that you get good food and service. You will get a hand pressed half pound burger here, not a frozen thin excuse for a burger that other places give you.  If you don't like what you get tell them, they will make it good, just be nice and honest with them.  They do listen to the customers!  I am not alone there are many regulars I see each time I visit.

Decent quality sushi, but we're in it for the beef cup, a cup full of steamed rice, veggies and most importantly braised teryaki beef. It's good and in a huge enough portion to split two way. Perfect for a cheep take out or on the run lunch, although during lunch hour, sushi lovers can get surprisingly busy, I mean it's so crowded, you can barely fit in. So without the crowd it's zippy but with, it's nauseatingly slow. Still pretty awesome though.

Sushi Lovers top 3:
1) beef cup
2) glass noodle
3) surprisingly awesome ramen

Pretty awful and cringeworthy. The restaurant is not air conditioned so be ready to sweat buckets. Food is overpriced for what you get--$45, before tax and tip, for a cocktail, a plate of nachos split 4 ways, and 3 of the smallest soft shell tacos I've ever seen. We're talking maybe 3 inches in diameter.

Nachos are not served with anything, guacamole, sour cream and salsa is all extra. Guacamole is also listed as "Market price"? Weird. Steak tacos were cold and chewy.

Beware the service--likely from the owner. After our nachos he came by, tossed all of our food to the right of the table without saying anything (he knocked over the bowl of guacamole and shoved my arm in the process) and then promptly sat a family of four...right at our table. I've never experienced something so incredibly awkward and bizarre. He took our water jug, put it on their side, then took our water glasses--which I drank out of--and put it in front of them. That family somehow got their tacos before we did, ate, left, then another group of 3 came and were seated right at our table--elbow to elbow--again.

Never, ever going back here. Terrible food and most awkward, uncomfortable dining experience.

I recently used Arrowhead Painting to have my home painted and rear yard fence repaired (stucco finish) and painted.  Mark came to my home and we both went over the work he and his company would do.  The following day he provided me with a proposal including the estimate.  His estimate was very reasonable.  I went with his company and was extremely please with his work.  The job was very complete and his people are extremely competent.  I highly recommend his company and  I really appreciated him going the extra effort in the little things.  He and his guys took a couple of extra hours picking up after themselves and checking over their work.  After he finished, I had several neighbors come over to my home and asked who painted my home.  I proudly recommended Mark and Arrowhead Painting!  
P.S.  Make sure you have him recondition your gates to your backyards.  He'll replace the wood slats and stain them an awesome redwood color with sealer.  He charges very little to do this after he paints your home.  You won't be disappointed!

The staff is very polite and professional.  One of the previous reviewer complained about the staff but I don't believe it's the office personnel, it's the insurance coverage she (the patient) chose.  I was seen by Dr. Stone and thought she was thorough and professional.  I liked her conservative approach and wasn't just throwing out expensive treatment suggestions.  I would recommend this practice to others.

The food is delicious. I went there with my family today and ordered the paneer chili and chili chicken as appetizers. What can i say the appetizers was absolutely amazing. Try ordering it at a level 6-7 spicy and it will burn your mouth. Loved the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Jalfrezi. They also have a check-in deal for yelp for a free lassi or soda. Last but not least one of my favorites was Gajar Halwa, it was nice and warm, and absolutely amazing. The prices are reasonable and cheap compared to other Indian Restaraunts around vegas. Chicken dishes are at $14 versus other restaraunts that have them for $18. They also have huge buffet for only $9.99. The most selections for the lowest prices. Now thats what i called a indian Buffet. I would deffinetly come back here again.

Stumbled into Max's looking for a brunch/Bloody Mary spot to watch the Badger game.  This place is fantastic!  American breakfast and grilled cheese (with spinach and bacon added) were both phenomenal- and use Stella's famously delicious cheese bread!  Great bloody Mary too.  Not a ton of beers on tap, but good options.  Most importantly the service was top notch and the atmosphere is terrific.  Plenty of room upstairs, great bar, and a cozy area with leather couches and a fireplace.  Highly recommend checking this place out if you haven't!

We had an accident resulting in a massive amount of red, green, and white/clear candle wax getting spilled all over the carpet.  Greg & Ryan were able to come out the day I called.  They were timely, friendly, professional, efficient, and courteous.  They told me there was only an ~80% chance that all of the wax could be removed, and I appreciated the honesty.  They completed the wax removal and cleaned 4 rooms in barely over an hour, and there is literally zero discoloration or other evidence that the accident ever occurred.  The rest of the cleaned carpet looks like new.  They have earned my future business and my recommendation- I couldn't have asked for a better experience!

Couple things really urked me about this place. Every hour everyone in the whole place has to line up to have their bracelet scanned. Not easy to keep a toddler in line with all that going on. And no outside food and drinks unless you paid for a party.. ok fine, but the only choices you have to purchase from are fountain drinks. So anyone who cares about their health is screwed... not even bottled water available.. fountain tap water it is! Blah. Couldn't pay me to come back.

This is the first time I've ever taken the time to write a bad review for anything.. But this place deserves due credit. While a few other mothers and I were sitting across the hall watching our FOUR YEAR OLD children from a room equipped with tv screens we hear coach Shauna bellow in a very loud deep tone &quot;I told you 4 times to get over here and pay attention&quot; and I'm talking like shes yelling at grown men in a barroom or something absurd. Completely startled we all glance at each other wondering if that really just happened. Followed by 2 other moms I walk to the room, concerned. When i asked Coach Shauna what was wrong she told me that the girls were just not listening. I told her that if she ever has a problem with my daughter to send her out of class, that i am always in the other room and that i do not approve of her yelling at her. the other mothers also voiced their concern in which Coach Shauna replied &quot;if you dont want your kid in my class they don't have to be&quot; Hello?! Last I knew I payed to have my kid in this class and never once did I sign her up to be disciplined especially in that manner! After requesting to speak with the manager about the incident and them returning my call after they reviewed the tape i was informed that they cant have the class disrupted. I am not about letting my daughter be rude and I am more than proud knowing that she is a very polite and respectful little girl, but these are FOUR year old kids Coach Shauna is dealing with and if she doesnt have the patients to teach four year olds then she shouldn't be! i'm also pretty sure they are suppose to be having fun and they are not training for the olympics. Needless to say I never went back and wasted a ton of money :( Beware of this scary place. Ps the tv screens suck too, can't see a thing!

By far the worst gel manicure I've ever got. Just eww. Glitter gel was not even. Thick as hell. Not shaped well made my nails look deformed. AAANNNDD this part is just sad funny... One lady did my cuticles and filed.. When she was done another lady "Mimi" stepped in to do the gel while the First Lady stood behind her and watched. I don't know what exactly they were saying but it was pretty apparent that she was teaching her how to do gel. Lol. Aren't you suppose to go to school and be certified to do that! Not to mention she's being trained by the worst nail technician I've ever met. Don't go here. Oh and another funny.. While I was there FedEx guy came and delivered a Manila envelope that required signature from a law firm. Maybe they will be shut down for their fraudulent nail service and no one else will have to experience such bull. The files were reused the cuticle trimmers didn't seem to be sterile the tray had nail dust on it ugh I could go on and on the more I write the more upset I get!

I'm an amateur when it comes to air duct cleaning. Although I did my best to educate myself and hire the highest-rated company nearby, it's almost impossible to know whether your ducts need cleaning, or whether the job was done correctly. For these reasons, I had reservations. As it turns out, the house we bought had new ductwork installed just two years ago and there was only minimal dust in the air ducts. The very professional crew came out and did their job. They were honest to offer their expert opinion. I then called Steve who listened intently to what I had to say. Long story short, he did what was the right thing to do, out of decency and good business ethics. He renewed my faith in honest business and unparalleled customer service. 
I plan on using their services every time. I highly recommend this company. Don't even look elsewhere.

I seldom write reviews for businesses but I know how daunting it is to find a reliable handyman. I'd like to point out that Brian does an exemplary job. He has a very polite and knowledgeable demeanor, and delivers excellent results. I've used this company for three jobs and I will keep using them for future needs. I especially like the fact that they base their estimates on specific details that the customer provides through pictures and measurements.

I have been there before and had gotten good service but today i went to get an oil change and a car wash. I went to the oil change guy first and he said he would take the car to get washed after he was done. about 20 minutes later he shows up to tell me that my filter needed changing and I say go ahead. He then tells me he will only take a few minutes and then off to the car wash. So there I am waiting patiently for my car to be done. I hate to be a pain so I wait without any concerns thinking to myself, these people know what they are doing. WRONG, i am waiting and waiting, finally i go see for myself what could be taking so long. The car was parked in the lot. No one ever bothered to inform me that my car was done. I complained to cashier who passed me off to the car wash manager. He apologized for the poor service and blamed it on the oil change guys. Said they were supposed to call me when it was done. Yeah right, they change oil not wash cars. They have no checks and balances over there. They don't work together as a complete service team. Next time I will just go to Jiffy. They are more professional. Lesson for others, if you get two services done, don't assume they work together. You are on your own to figure who is done with what and be your own customer service because they have none there.

Been here about 6 or 7 times and finally met the owner Pete. Great guy! We are proud to support this local business. The service has always been friendly, fast, and accommodating. The food is EXCELLENT and priced in my opinion lower than expected. As other posts have mentioned, a sign board is displayed infront of the restraunt. It is updated to reflect current political/religious events. We look forward to the opinions being posted by the employees. This is a business who chooses to take great pride in their products, service, and patriotism. Simply Greek...simply amazing.

I would never stay here again, or refer anybody to stay here.  After staying there for one year, keeping the place clean, and finishing my MBA at Thunderbird, I moved out (along with my roommate).  We made an appointment to meet with the maintenance personnel to do a walk-through of the place before leaving because we had heard that the complex was unfairly keeping people's security deposits.  After the walk-through, the maintenance person said everything was fine.  The carpet was vacuumed and everything was clean.  Then, 3 weeks later I get my security deposit notice-  that they have taken my deposit and they want me to pay $75.00 beyond it.  

Management told me there was nothing I could do about it.  I also had issues with rude management during an extension of my lease and adding somebody onto the lease.  I escalated the case to rkproperties management and they claimed that they took pictures of stains on carpets.  Also, my roommate had opened the microwave one day and a piece of the top fell off . . .just fell off!  We were told that it was 'damaged' above normal wear and tear and the maintenance personnel's word was the last.  Since when is opening a microwave door 'damage?'  It was probably broken before we even moved in.  Again, we were told that the maintenance personnel had the last word.  Seriously?  This is how you treat part of your largest group of renters, business school students?

We had domestic violence in the apartment below us, ambulances came, they were screaming and yelling and fighting all the time.  And the apartment management chooses quiet students, with other potential quiet, orderly renting friends, to pick on.  That's just bad business, and I will not recommend ANY TBird to go there.  Beware!

Add to that the five bucks I would give the delivery guy and I'm into it for just shy of $40.  Their pizza is o.k., but not even close to the quality that would command that price.

Breathless over the bad treatment I received in this local kitchenware store. I've been a customer for 17 years, and went in today to return a cutting board that had both warped and split apart. Not only did Didier accuse me of not having bought it at his shop, but he also claimed he didn't sell this brand and particular item. (Hard to believe given the pile of similar cutting boards on sale near the cash.) 

Probably should have brought my receipt the first time, but figured as a longstanding customer it'd be no problem. My mistake. So I went home dug up my receipt and returned. Only to be told 'No return, no refund. Sue me.'

Avoid the overpriced "Word of Mouth" Upscale Kitchen shop on Spadina Road in Forest Hill Village.

Beware the offbeat (i.e., quasi bag-lady) patron with her belongings piled up (for hours!) on the window counter, otherwise a predictable Second Cup experience.

Had the Elote Dog. Amazing flavor, not too heavy on the toppings. One of the best things I've had to eat in quite a while. The fries are great too, but I didn't care for the chili. Definitely coming back

OK, let me start out by prefacing the fact that I've ordered from here several times along with my co-workers (upon their recommendations) and the food was generally pretty good. I've had their italian sausage sandwich (decent), the philly cheese sandwich (pretty good), pastrami (pretty good) and their chef salad. The chef salad is quite decent but they put these onions on it that look like they were meant to be battered and deep fried for onion rings. They were so large and overpowering that I started requesting to leave them off of the salad. Overall, the food has been decent, but this last time, I decided to get a small order of chili cheese fries. My God, that was a mistake. The chili was obviously out of a can...easily mistaken for dog food (even the smell took me for a loop). The cheese was like cheez-wiz....not appetizing at all. And like many reviewers stated, the fries were soggy. The fries are ALWAYS soggy. They don't punch a hole in the containers to let the steam out so once they're delivered, they are too far gone. 

As for the delivery time, that's absolutely crazy too. For being in a fairly close proximity to their establishment, they sure take a LONG time, even if it's just an order of salads for myself and my co-workers. The delivery guy is different every single time and they are often a bit rude. 

My co-worker ordered the chef salad yesterday, but was told they increased the price by almost $2.00. We unanimously agreed that we'll find some place new to get lunch. 

The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because I can't lie and say they don't have good food, they do. But when you wait well over an hour for your food, you hope it at least tastes good, and when something as easy as chili cheese fries is as egregiously bad as it was yesterday, it's hard to want to eat there again.

I like the previous reviewer had same issues for scheduling and overcharged on estimate . Owner told me we would do remnant but than ordered. To top off his inept staff made a pipe leak in bathroom and leaked through ceiling to bottom floor on top of furniture that was soaked. IT WAS HORRIBLE. We went and talked with owner and said he'd look into it and never called back or rectified situation. Now we smell mild. WORST COMPANY EVER.

Awful! She spent 5 minutes with me!  She rushed through visit and showed no compassion whatsoever. Never listened to me and claimed I've tried "everything" and didn't think she could help.  
She is one of the worse providers I have been to, hands down. 
Also she refused to do MRI even though I have PA for years. she ordered X-Rays of parts of body that I have no pain. Very weird.  My Physical therapist was surprised by her lack of care. 
rude and unprofessional. Of all things she rigorously shook my hand-- knowing I have terrible hand/ joint pain. Really??   Just goes to show, her level of ignorance.

WORST medical care I have EVER had-- hands down!. STAFF- HORRIBLE - attitudes. 
Dr stood over top of me while I sat in side chair by door. She showed no compassion, knowledge, or care.  and didn't even do the exam. her NP did.  She shook my hand very rigorously-- knowing i have immense pain in (joints) of the hands. Unbelievable. WOW-- really intelligent dr.  You almost wonder how they obtained their degree.
 She walked in and out in 5 minutes or less.  Refused to give me a script of anything . She told me she couldn't order MRI and to go to Pain Clinic for that. WOAH..... I work in the medical field and i wonder how long some of these providers will get away with treating patients like dirt?!  Actually pretty frightening.  I waited 6 months for this appt! Apparently found out from the NP it was due to my insurance. ummmm.. ok?  BYE BYE

I stopped by for an egg sandwich on a Wednesday morning. My server was unfriendly and gave off negative energy from the beginning. I waited, waited and waited for my sandwich to come out. I finally asked him how much longer (about 30 mins) and he was rude again, saying....."ummm I couldn't tell ya.. sorrrrry. He said it with no compassion and concern. I simply walked out the door telling another server... It shouldn't take over 30 minutes for one egg sandwich on a SLOW day. But honestly, It was this  mans tone and rudeness that will never  bring me back. It's too bad. 
Way to many other places to eat that treat you with respect.

I  had to call 4 times about a Prior- Auth-- still getting a run around. The communication is terrible here. I had a Pap done 4 weeks ago and still waiting for results. I do NOT recommend this place for excellent patient care. 
As a matter of fact, 3 different workers there told me different things. Practice Manger wasn't much help.  I would go somewhere else.

When we finally got our food my burger the animal was over cooked and my oldest son's(10) chicken basket was under cooked. Needless to say he got food poisoning. My older brother recommended this joint. I was not impressed either by the certificates they had displayed from 5-6 years ago. I will not return ever.

It was recommended that I visit Tacos El Gordo, so I took the advice and I was more than pleasantly satisfied. I wanted to try a variety of what they offered, so I ordered the Vampiro with al pastor, carne asada taco, al pastor taco and an al pastor Mula. Everything I ordered tasted amazing. I highly recommend this place, just make sure you get there on a not so empty stomach because the wait time is  quite a while, but most definitely worth it! And make sure you stand in the line according to the meat that you want. There are different lines for the different types of meats. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!

I would rate this place a zero if I could. I'm glad I didn't stay to get a haircut. I checked in online with 0 wait time. (0 wait time should have raised a red flag...Go figure) I went in with my sons and my aunt to get haircuts before Christmas. I walked in and 2 employees where sitting and didn't acknowledge us. After a couple of minutes, one of them asked if I had checked in online. I said "yes, that's my name on the screen." I hadn't registered the other names, so as I spelled the other names out for her, she kept telling me to wait, and then she would say "go ahead," and as I started spelling it out for her again, she would tell me to wait. She attempted to spell my son's name and she spelled it incorrectly. I told her what the last person's name was and I began spelling it for her and with the worst attitude, 
she said, "I know how to spell." By that time I had enough of her attitude and my wife asked if I wanted to leave and I replied, "yes." I went down the street to a different Great Clips and it was an absolutely better experience. As soon as we walked in, they greeted me & checked me in. They were way busier than the other location. It was a good thirty minute wait, but well worth it! Go there instead by the Winco on Decatur.

As with many Las Vegs clubs, 1 OAK is overpriced. $30 entry on a Saturday night even though we were guests at the hotel. Once we were in the drinks were pretty unreasonable too - $14 for a Vokda and Cook and $7 just for a small soda. The atmosphere was fin but the dance floor is tiny and an absolutely stuffed with people.

To be honest this place is not worth paying for. Try another, bigger club on a Saturday night.

Unfortunately six months after getting a used car from this dealership I was left with no choice but to replace the vehicle. I am not able to say my experience with the car I was sold was a good one. In the first 3 months the car was in the mechanics shop 5 separate times. The first problem happened in the first 48 hours. Granted the dealership paid for that repair since the warranty refused to. And the fifth trip to the mechanic was also paid for by the dealer. None the less, when the first problem happened I was told that if trouble persisted I would be placed in a different vehicle. 5 separate trips to the mechanic showed a persisting problem. I wasn't placed in a different vehicle. This vehicle has been nothing but a money pit from the start. I will not be replacing the engine. 
    This vehicle has not been reliable. I felt I was left no other choice but to go and get a new car that is reliable from a reputable dealership. I understand that there are people that have had good experiences with getting a car from good carma. Unfortunately I cannot say my experience was among them. I paid for a 3 month warranty that refused to cover repairs that were included in the warranty agreement. 
    So here is my revised and updated review. Unfortunately I don't feel I can change my rating due to all I have experienced.

The venue provided an open, clean, and inviting environment for all, and I look forward to working together again. Between the excellent customer service, mouthwatering menu, and perfect location nestled in the heart of the DTLV's Arts District, there's no other coffee shop that compares. Thank you, Makers & Finders for an amazing experience!

We were a group of 8 Las Vegas locals celebrating a friend's birthday.. our first impression was great we had some drinks at the bar and the bartender was very knowledgeable and nice we were seated at one of the best tables in the restaurant. My whole group would agree that once seated we were disapointed with the service from our waiter he suggested the Chef's Tasting menu($45each) due to the size of our party we all thought that was reasonable but one of the members of our group has a food allergy to mushrooms and 3 of the six items contained mushrooms, when asked to substitute our waiter acted offended and told them "to eat around the mushrooms". We opted out of the tasting menu after the comment was made and ordered some delicious items like the Crab Lettuce Wraps, Pesto Pasta, Asparagus with egg, Flat Breads and other items. The service improved with the evening sadly once they realized we would possibly be repeat customers and after talking to the sommelier about the waiters personality . The bill was over $850 for tapas, dessert, cava toast and wine(2 @bottles at $70each). Overall the food was good and the atmosphere was great.

We go to this pizza place almost every week for girls night out. I have tried almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed.  The Cesar Salad is delicious. The fried zucchini appetizer or the garlic knots are fantastic. The service is friendly and attentive.

The manager Cameron always speaks to us and makes sure that our food came out good. Not many managers make it a habit to know their frequent customers.  On occasion he has even brought out our food to us just to say hello.

If you love pizza or Italian you will not be disappointed.

But I absolutely love the food here at Bella, just had a slice of mushroom today, apparently you can get a slice of whatever the heck you want any time of day, but my all time favorite is the Bella Delight... Fried eggplant covered with ricotta cheese, Italian sausage, homemade marinara and mozzarella... And then they bake it. No wonder I eat here all the time.

Honestly, I. love. Baskin Robbins.  The only ice cream I ever eat now is Baskin Robbins' Cookies and Cream!  It's the only place I ever go to if I'm craving ice cream.

However, I experienced the worst service at this location which is around St. Patrick's station downtown.  The employee there was so rude.
So, my friend and I came into the store first.  No greeting.  I mean, whatever, nothing too big to complain about.  We were browsing the flavours when two other girls came into the store.  The employee then talked to them and they seemed to be friends.  After two minutes, we were ready to order and the employee was still talking to the two girls for around 5-10 minutes.  She also served them first! (Ha!)  It wasn't until her friend stopped (annoyed) and pointed at us, whispering, apparently signalling for her friend (the employee) to go and serve us.  The employee also looked annoyed that she had to stop her conversation 'cus we wanted to order something... so anyway, we asked her if she had the Cookies & Cream flavour and she just replied, "No."  That's it!  and then she went back to her friends.  She didn't even say, "Sorry" "Do you want anything else" and she didn't even ask my friend who was actually ready to order her Pistachio ice cream.  She just said one word and went back to talk to her friends.  

It was like we weren't even there!  I find it so rude to be treated as if you don't even exist.  It's so much worse than being given attitude...at least the person acknowledges your presence.  I will NEVER go to this location again.  I love Baskin Robbins but I'd rather just walk to the Eaton Centre location than go to this place again!  I hope no one ever has to experience being ignored like that.

A cute place to lounge and relax in with your friends.  It's comfortable and neat.  I've been here two to three times now and I've always sat on the couches with the big coffee tables.  

+ Oh and I asked for water once and they pointed me to the little water cooler table near the door.  I didn't really mind getting up to pour myself water but just something I wanted to point out.

It's a bit pricy but this is the only reason I come back here:

The chocolate waffles are heavenly.

Also, the heart post-it message board is really cute.  I remember writing messages with my friends on there back when I was in high school.

Dropped the car of for an oil change, tire rotation (which they do for free since I bought the tires there), check of the transmission fluids, and power steering. I left with an oil change. 1 out of the 4 things I asked for was completed.  The reason I know nothing got done was it was not on my receipt for checking the fluids and I mark my tires to make sure they do a tire rotation.  I got home and my same mark was on my drivers side front tire.  Called them back and they said since my tires were worn that they can't rotate them...um b.s. They flat out did not do it.  This was after they would not prorate me for new tires that I bought from them and got 35,000 miles on 65,000 mile tires. They said I needed to have tire rotation records (which I do have just not from Brian's).  How do you get tire rotation records when you don't rotate the tires?  When I called Bridgestone about my tire warranty they said to not go there (Brian's) and go to another place   Shady place..be careful.

I had a fine experience opening my account. Life changes necessitated me rolling these funds to another custodian after 2 years. A full 6 weeks after the new custodian, a major corporation, sent ALL the proper paperwork to ETC, ETC decided one of the forms was "too light" and needed to be resubmitted by the new custodian. Then they said that they would need "at least" three more weeks to "review" the replaced form before they would transfer my funds. I am about ready to book a flight to Ohio so I can scream at them in person. They talk around and around in circles, pathetic excuse for a company.

This place has great service! The mechanic is extremely knowledgable and honest. He does good work and charges a fair price. 

My car wouldn't start one day but when the tow truck got to me it started. I thought my starter was going out, but I took my car here and he knew right away that it needed a battery. He put in a new one to check it and make sure that was the problem. He said I could take it somewhere else but he dialed O'Reilly's and had me ask them what they charge to prove he was giving me a good deal. This is definitely a good place to bring a vehicle for repairs.

Four friends and myself ate at Alloy for my Birthday dinner last night and I must say I was not overly impressed. 
The decor is unique and the atmosphere was cool but that just does not make up for average food at an above average price. If it were not for the food I think I would give this place a 4! But in the end that is what tells the real story for me. 
We all tried a different starter, main and we shared a few salads so I can certainly say I gave it a fair chance. 
Service was friendly but did not seem overly knowledgeable, no food descriptions or desire created,
Dish presentation was quite nice, 
Food was sub par, I kept expecting to be wowed by one of the 12 + dishes we ordered but in the end the candle burnt out and we were left with a hefty bill and disappointed taste buds. 
I may go back when the patio is open on a nice day to give it one more shot but that will be long after I try several other places on the bookmark list including some repeats to places like The Muse and Rouge where I would gladly spend my time and money :)

Great location, atmosphere, knowledgeable staff and in the end every little morsel of food was gobbled up and plates licked clean haha. 
The 3 people who joined me had the same reaction and we all said we would go back any time! 

Thank you for an intimate, delightful dining experience!

This salon is sub-par. If you make an appointment you will quickly learn that actually doing hair is not the priority here. The stylists are watching TV/bootleg movies, texting, and taking cell phone calls while doing the client's hair. As a client, I felt like I was distracting my stylist from watching her movie rather than being the focus of her attention. Also, expect to be double booked for a hair appointment time slot and don't be surprised if the stylist leaves you under the dryer for 40 minutes to run down the street to the store. I have always had natural hair and I am used to the way black salons normally run and this is below average. 

I might be able to deal with the unprofessionalism if my hair was done well, but this isn't the case. The stylist burned my hair because she was trying to do everything but pay attention to her job. On a positive note-the staff there is nice and polite, but I still won't be going back.

i have been a customer for a long time and the staff has always been friendly, knowledgable, and available when you need to find something.  i trade in my clothes and the process is quick and easy.  the two men (Josh and Dave) are always friendly and willing to help you.  they work very hard and keep things organized.  i think it's the best that i have seen in all the years that i have been there.
i like that they have all sorts of other things to buy.  it's not just clothes but a lot of household goods to update your decor.  it's just a fun place to spend a few hours either buying or looking!

YUMMY! Had dinner here our first night, then breakfast the next morning, and breakfast again the next morning. The wait staff is awesome! The GM indicated they had a re-do about 3 months back and everything is made from scratch, even the jams. Back to the original recipes. 

Great food at a great value!

I moved to Shaker about a year ago, with the loyalty to the barbershop I've been visiting, I have never tried any local barbershop. I have been driving back and forth 2 hours to go back to Tiffin to visit, then trying to catch the barber's free time between the appointments. 

Long story short. I have to get a hair cut by today, can't wait due to scheduling issue. Found this one near by, decided to give it a try. 

Sgro's doesn't go by appointments. I walked in around 5:05, the shop closes at 5:30. They took their time to meet my specific request for my hair style. By the time was done, it was already pass the closing time. The outcome is clean and neat. 

They really know their stuff. 

Now, one more place to go for my haircut, and will go back again.

Had dinner here last Saturday night and do not plan to ever return.  Our meal started out with the Shrimp Rolls which came quick and very hot.  They were really good and we all enjoyed them a great deal.  After eating them we were very excited about the rest of our meal.  We ordered and then waited just under an hour for our entrees!  Our server, who was very unattentive, never came to the table to explain the delay.  I finally had to flag her down and ask what was going on in the kitchen  Her response was "the kitchen is very backed up with take out orders".  Well, what about the diners sitting in house waiting for their meals?  She never asked if we wanted another drink or water.  Again we had to get her attention and ask for water.  Finally, when our meals did come, they were a big disappointment.  We ordered medium spice and got no heat at all.  I really think they never added any spice to the meals.  The Raad Na was very, very salty.  The saltiness just overpowered the dish.  The Pad Thai was too sweet and the noodles were too chopped for my taste.  We left feeling very disappointed and vowed never to return.

We ate dinner here on Tuesday evening and had an absolutely wonderful meal!  Ordered the shroom french fries which were very, very good but oh so filling.  One could eat these as a meal and be totally satisified.  We tried three different burgers and they all were very, very good.  I had the burger special of the evening and it was cooked to perfection.  After all the fries I could only eat half but it was just as good warmed up the next day.  There is no children's menu but our server was very helpful in making suggestions as to what would be good choices for the kids to share.  The portions are quite hearty, so there certainly was enough food to share.  They ordered the wings and what a good choice that was.  I never order wings as they are usually to fatty or greasy for my taste.  Not the wings here---they are the best I have ever tasted.  It was like eating very good fried chicken.  They were huge and once again, cooked to perfection.  Service was very good and very friendly.  We left full and looking forward to a return visit.  It is always a treat to discover such a good place to eat!!   Can't wait to go back.

Rio Carnival World Buffet has been a favorite of mine in Vegas. Food selection is superb.  The most memorable experience I have is meeting Sal the maitre d. He is happy  always no matter what a mad house the buffet area becomes. He has great memory for the regular repeat customers and he has an amazing staff. I would go to the buffet just to see Sal. You will agree once yoy have experienced his style of customer service. The food is great, service is superb and there is great customer service.

Famous long waiting line in this place.  I've been dine twice in this small bar counter restaurant.  
This time I had a half dozen Oyster and pan roasted seafood (level 4 spicy).   I have to say this time, the pan roast was very salty and I needed to have a sour bread to dilute the taste in my mouth on top of a cup of rice.  A gentleman next to me ordered gumbo but same issue I had despite different dish.  He had to stop eating because too salty.   
The chef was funny but with a twist.  Sarcastic jokes to customers, sometimes offensive.  It was midnight and he must be tired but that I don't count as an excuse.   As long as he talk to customer can't I expect some pleasant comments?
Oyster was good but very pricy.  
If you wanna try, ask less salt because you can always add it to your taste.   I'm sure they can make it again but only if you would wait for another 15min for sure.

A keeper Korean BBQ place.  I think it is bit pricy above average but food was very good.   We had marinated Galbi but they also have seong? Galbi which is not marinated.   That Galbi is available at a good Korean BBQ place to taste real meat flavor.   Well one of us really wanted that marinated this time and it was an excellent choice.   
After 11pm they deduct 20% and it is average price with really good dining I think.   

The receptionist was very attentive and we liked her service.  Table waitress is ok. 

We had paejyong? Pancake also.  It didn't took my fancy but all small dishes especially Kimchi was very good.  

I certainly would come back this place for tofu stew menu and other choices.  

They have a semi private dining area for a group dining.   I can use this for business dinner

I didn't eat here because I was sitting at the sushi bar for 5 to 7 min without any serving. Appx. only 20% of seats were occupied. Some waitress were even cleaning tables while I was waiting to be served. 
The Korean BBQ restaurant is next door and kitchen is same for both.
Service was very poor

Excellent sushi here. All chef at the bar are Japanese too.  They have traditional Sushi and also creative menus upon request.  I recommend you to sit at counter. Very nice chefs can explain you about where the fish comes from, etc.  
The atmosphere at other tables are more like upscale bar lounge and totally different feeling from the counter.  It is pricy but it worth to try in this town.

The display of this store was excellent. Many selections for grands(Kawai, Petroff, others), uprights and digitals(great Rolland selection). They offer music lessons and rentals. Besides the Pianos, they sell guitars and other band instruments. I highly recommend this store.  Store staffs are friendly.  They have 3 locations but visited only EAST location, and they told me they have 7' grands in WEST too. I'll inform it next time.

I had lunch at here. So no lobsters or oyster seafoods highlight. If you select specific foods, it is ok. I have to narrow down to following: 
In sushi: salmon, eel, shrimp roll
In grill: yaki soba, shrimp tempura 
In desert: green tea soft ice-cream, mocha cake, and of course fresh fruits

I didn't try all but may be 80%.  Many others i cannot recommend unfortunately.

This is an outstanding sushi place in Vegas.  I cannot compare the quality to $$$$ sushi place but at reasonable price($26) with the great neta to rice ratio, this is a 4 star for me.  
Well, simply all you can eat sushi is not recommended generally speaking, and its poor selection and robot made like sushi is just out of discussion.   
This place, however, four sushi chefs are working so hard like humming bird and you can eat premium such as uni, amaebi, fatty salmon too on top of regular one and appetizers (those premiums are one order only though).  After you try all others, one time premium sushi is just fine for me.  
Fifth star could be by adding some basic selection I usually can find such as Aji or Kohada, and due to the speedy preparation, the rice isn't treated well sometimes.  Fall apart before you put it in mouth... 
But you don't get all at the price, right?   The price is without drink.  All menu food items are included!
I'm happy to go there again.

I had an ignition issue on a Mercedes C300 that basically bricked my car on a tight garage. After trying, unsuccessfully, with couple other towing companies, I was referred to Urban Towing. He showed up on time, with a mint truck to pick it up and was able to, within minutes, tow it from its spot while taking care of not scratching any of the underbody. He is knowledgeable and professional. I would recommend Urban Towing!

BEWARE!  BARTENDER AND BARBACKS ARE SHADY!!

I'm a local and come to Oshea's often to see my DJ friends perform. I've been here multiple times, this place is great and I always have a good time. I go there especially for their $3 frozen Baileys.

I walked in around 11 pm on a monday night. 3/28/2016. I was excited to take a friend of mine (who is from out of town) to Oshea's for some drinks and a good time as always. I ordered 2 frozen baileys and handed the bartender a $20 bill. HE DID NOT COME BACK TO GIVE ME MY CHANGE AND SCAMMED ME. When I asked the barback how much my drinks were, he kind of played dumb and said "I'm not sure, probably $6-$10" SO I BELIEVE THEY WERE BOTH IN ON IT. I asked the bartender how much the drinks were, and told me $10 each.

At the time , I wasn't sure what the correct price was and believed what he told me . BUT HE STILL DIDNT PRINT ME OUT A RECEIPT TO SHOW ME THE CHARGE! I just finished our drinks and left. When I asked my friends (who is a regular DJ at OSHEAS) he told me there ALWAYS $3!

I hope this review is helpful to whoever is reading this. I hope this finds its way to management and that they look into their staff. Don't let the bartenders and staff rip you off. Especially if you're a tourist. BEWARE! 

I  SUPPORT MY MUSICIAN AND DJ FRIENDS BUT WILL NEVER GO BACK TO OSHEAS  AND SPEND MY MONEY HERE THERE AGAIN.

This place has recently opened with huge lines. Everyone, ORDER ONLINE! You can order from their website and pick up at a side window, skipping the entire line. When we did this, we were a little earlier than our specified order time so we did have to wait a little. If we had arrived on time, we wouldn't have had to wait. 

In regards to the food, I ordered a small pesto pasta and had low expectations. It actually was better than I thought it was going to be. The pasta and tomatoes with it were very fresh. There were supposed to be mushrooms but I think I had one in my entire dish. 

The portion size was so generous I actually thought they had given me a large instead of a small. I was eating with a friend and she ordered the peanut saute which looked very small. 

I would recommend not eating at this location. There aren't many tables and since the dine-in area is encased in glass, it's very loud. 

I would probably return.

I'd say this review trends a bit higher towards the 4 than the 3, but I just couldn't give it the 4. 

We made reservations for a party of 4 on a Saturday night. Good thing too because the place was packed! I've actually tried to get in to this restaurant without reservations and been turned away because it's so busy. 

The restaurant itself is nicely appointed. We were seated in the back at a cute little booth, allowing us to look out at the whole of the restaurant. 

The service was friendly but a bit slow at times. It seemed that any time we wanted to order (drinks, entrees, and dessert), we had to wait for a fairly long time for our server to notice us. However cleaning up plates was very efficient. 

We also had problems with the restaurant running out of items we wanted. One person in the party ordered their ravioli and was told upon ordering that they were out of it. It really bothers me when restaurants don't tell you up front what they don't have in stock anymore. Otherwise you are happy with your choice and then need to make a split decision because the restaurant doesn't have it.  Two of us were also drinking Coke Zero and they ran out of that half way through the meal too. 

In terms of the food, I've been to this restaurant a few years ago and remember the food being better than this visit. I had the wild cheese tortellini and found it to be a bit bland. My husband had the bolognese which I also found to be a bit bland. The bruschetta was delicious and the tartufo was good as well so it was just the pasta sauces that could have used a bit more salt, or extra oomph. 

Comparing this restaurant to Michael's Back Door on Lakeshore, I'd prefer Michael's Back Door.

We've been regulars at the Apricot Tree for ages, for both dinner and dessert. The schnitzel is my favourite dish there, though sometimes I'll get one of the specials (usually when they have duck or veal). All of the desserts I've had there have been delicious, my favourite being the dobos torte. However since this is apparently a difficult dessert to make, it's unusual that they have it. 

Over the past year, this restaurant has lost most of their regular staff and has seemed to suffer from that. Now that those staff have been around for 6-8 months, they finally seem to be getting in to a groove and service isn't as slow as it was months ago. We've never had unfriendly service here, just slow at times. 

The portion sizes also seem to have decreased a bit. With the schnitzel, I have to ask for extra mushroom sauce because the small cup they serve isn't enough. That said, the price point at this restaurant is very fair. 

There is a patio to sit on, but it's right beside Dundas and can be a bit noisy at times, though it is nice to sit outside. 

I'm sure we'll continue to return to The Apricot Tree, though it would be nice to see different specials or menu items as it seems to always be the same. There is a schnitzel fest coming soon so I look forward to that.

This is the best fish and chips place in Mississauga I've been to. I've only had their halibut and chips, and stick to it, though I'd eventually like to try some of their other fish (if I can get past the halibut!)

I've only ever gotten take out here but it is served pretty quickly and properly for fish and chips, in a cardboard box. I can't stand places that use styrofoam as it makes the fish soggy. Thankfully, these guys do it old fashioned!

Their fish is lightly battered and crisp. The fries as delicious and obviously fresh. I also believe they are double fried. 

The home made tartar sauce is good, though they usually give you the packets with your to-go bag, I would like their homemade stuff! It's much better!

Had a great meal here on the weekend for their schnitzel fest. I made reservations but they weren't required as there were a few empty seats when we arrived at 7:30.

Bistro Narra seems to do specialty menus every so often, which is great for additional variety. This time it was schnitzel fest. I tried the cordon bleu and it was very easy for me to sub out french fries and sub in parsley potatoes instead. 

When the meal came, it was a tad over-cooked (fried too long), but still delicious. Didn't order dessert this time, but I usually do and it is always good. 

Service was great, quick, and friendly. The chef came out to say hello and our service was very attentive. I couldn't believe how quickly our meals came out. 

I like the decor of this restaurant, it's fresh, modern, and clean. 

The regular menu seems to change a bit. Which is good for the variety, but bad if you find something you really enjoy and then it disappears (like the corn soup, which was one of the best soups I've ever had and is now gone :( ).

This is a great place for coffee, but it's not my cup of tea for food. 

I like the atmosphere, especially now that they've expanded (before I remember this place being pretty cramped). It is a bit loud when it's packed but it's nice, bright, and airy. 

The coffee is also delicious and it's one of the few places where you can find a real flat white, just like what you would get in New Zealand. 

The food is too over the top for me. I'd prefer some more simplistic stuff on the menu. If I recall correctly, they used to have a grilled cheese on the menu that was really good but now it seems to only be on the kids menu. 

I'd re-visit this place for a coffee some time but don't know if I'd come back to eat anything.

Would give 3.5 if I could. 

Made reservations for dinner and decided we wanted to sit on the patio so saw very little of the interior of the restaurant. The patio itself is quite small but we were the only people out there and since this restaurant is set back from Lakeshore, it was quite pleasant. 

The food was very good and worthy of more stars. The bread served at the table was incredibly fresh. Since this is a wine bar, there's a decent selection of wines and we tried something we hadn't heard of before. I had the veal chop special which was served with two large and yummy prawns. I wish I had been asked how I liked my veal as it served well done and I prefer more medium rare. For dessert, I had tiramisu which was excellent. 

My problem with this restaurant was the service. Our server was friendly at the beginning but we had a couple of problems. My grandfather is a 93 year old man that can't hear well and can't speak all that clearly. The server misunderstood what he ordered and when utensils were brought out for the food, it was clear there had been a mistake. Instead of apologizing for it, the server got defensive and said that she had repeated the order and no one corrected it. She went back to the kitchen and corrected it, then came out and asked him if he was ok with that. He said of course, because it's what he ordered and she said yes, you better be ok with that. She started off quite friendly, and she ended quite friendly, but this caused some tension. 

My other complaint would be the amount of time it took. From sitting down to being served food it was 45 minutes. Similarly, from ordering desserts to getting them it was about another 15 minutes. I can't comment on how busy the restaurant was because we weren't inside but this still felt lengthy to me. 

Not sure if we'll be back. It was good food with a slow kitchen and weird blips of anger from the server.

I've been here plenty of times and have never once completely ordered for myself. I love the cold milk tea but every time I try to order it, the waiter looks at me like I'm from outer space and my friend takes over for me in Chinese. 

Aside from the language problem, food here is quite good. I've tried quite a variety of things but really enjoy their fried rice, beef in black bean sauce, and the stir fried snow pea leaves (I've never had this before until this restaurant).

We like being seated in a booth and usually can unless it's very busy. 

Service, aside from my language problems with the milk tea, is pretty good. They bring food out quickly, replace tea quickly and always ask how things are (I'm assuming... they ask in Chinese to my friend). You do need to waive down someone to get the bill but that too comes quickly and things are pretty cheap.

Had a Groupon deal for this restaurant so went and tried it out having heard some good things about their burgers (and not so good things about their service).  Thank god we had a Groupon deal... I can't imagine paying for this meal full price.

We made reservations and when we arrived 5 minutes early, the waitress looked at us like she had no idea what to do with us. This restaurant is very small - only 10 tables, but there was a table for 4 and a table for 2. I'm not sure what's hard to determine on where to seat 2 people? The waitress had to ask someone else for help on where to seat us. 

Eventually got seated, ordered drinks (pop) and were told the specials. My husband ordered the burger, I ordered their steak special. My first mistake was not asking how much the steak cost. I would have expected a little under $30 and instead it was $34. A little overpriced. The burger is more than fair at $17 and a huge portion. 

The problem with this place is the absolute asinine prices they charge for pop. The two of us each ordered a Diet Coke and then asked for refills. The bill came out to $16 just for the drinks!!! 16 freaking dollars for soda!! We could by 3 cases of pop for this. Instead, we probably had 3 cans between the two of us. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor when I saw this charge. 

In terms of food, it was pretty tasty. 

For service, we had problems getting the refills (maybe we would have been better off if the service had been worse and we didn't get them at all). It also took an hour and 45 minutes for one course. I noticed the table beside us had to ask 3 times for their drink. 

Oh yes, and every table around us had bread on their table but we got nothing.

Visited this place in the middle of a warm  weekday afternoon. As other's have mentioned, it's a pretty small place but this didn't cause us any issues. 

I'll be honest, I don't really understand how to order.... still. I ended up with one flavour of ice cream (are you allowed two? I don't know). I wish there was a little more selection in the flavours.  Then I added two items to my ice cream and it was mixed in well and put in a waffle cone.  The waffle cone was very good. The ice cream was ok. I chose the dark chocolate ice cream and it wasn't too dark chocolate tasting. 

There's also a CAA discount, which was appreciated.

Visited Erin Park Lexus without an appointment to look at the 2015 CT and had to wait about 15 minutes for someone available to see me. Not a big issue because the receptionist kindly offered coffee while we waited.   

I let the Sales person know I was looking at the CT and got some background information on the car before being taken to his desk and asked about whether I wanted to finance or lease. Upon saying finance, the sales rep proceeded to break down all of the costs for leasing and why it's better. I'm just at the beginning stages of looking for cars right now! I don't care about financing vs. leasing. I need to pick a car before I do so.   

The rep finally goes to find us a car to test drive and I'm put in 2011 CT. That's right, a USED car with 80k on it. There was a brand new CT on the lot, which the rep said they had just gotten in, but apparently putting potential customers in used cars when they want to buy new is how this dealership thinks it is going to get sales.  

Fine, let's test drive this car. Half way through the test drive, the rep gets a call on his phone and says we need to be back at the dealership in 5 minutes because he has another customer waiting.  

This dealership obviously doesn't care at all about having me as a customer. Rest assured, the feeling is mutual and I will never return.

Walked in on a Monday afternoon and not surprisingly it was dead. There was still a decent selection of treats and the smell was divine. Staff was friendly and we were served after taking a look at everything there was to offer. 

We ended up with 2 sausage rolls and half a dozen pecan butter tarts. Price came out to a little over $20. I didn't have the sausage roll until the next day but it was still yummy. The pastry here is good. 

The butter tarts, however, were awful. No flavour and overly gelatinous. I think I could make better butter tarts.

Edit: 8/30/15 - just got my credit card bill for this restaurant. I had used a new credit card so couldn't put in my pin. Joe Badali's decided to add to their tip above and beyond what I gave them. I gave a 15% tip! I can't stand restaurants that do this. Lowering my review from 3 stars to 1. Congratulations Joe Badali's. You suck. 

Original Review: Having been here a few years ago, I remember thinking it was mediocre and hadn't been back until this week, where I was reminded how mediocre it is. 

I was here for lunch, where this restaurant has a fixed price menu (outside of Summer/Winterlicious). I tried this and had a Cesar salad which had nice and creamy dressing, the pappardelle alfredo which was pretty bland, and then a scoop of gelato. The gelato was vanilla and pretty good, however I wasn't allowed to choose what flavour I wanted. Is vanilla the only flavour they have? Overall, a pretty blase meal. 

Service was ok, nothing special. I like the design of this restaurant though, it's pretty cool, if you don't mind the subway rumbling below your feet every few minutes.

I've seen many doctors from both eastern and western medicine, but no one has helped me as much as the Shyu family. They are extremely knowledgeable and explained everything as we went through treatment. Told me what I might expect and what I should do to complement the treatment. The results were immediate and I continue to see them when I need help.

While we were happy with the end result of the build the options were limited but they did manage to work with us on a few things. The real problem wasn't so much with the builders but the TBI lender they are affiliated with. They had 6 months to help us secure a loan. We were rushed into doing our walk throughs in April and it is now June and still haven't closed. They have chosen a lender Wellsfargo that seems to be in the business of not giving loans. I blame TBI for not preunderwriting our loan and getting everything in place. They seem to have zero clout with their lender and don't have any interest in going to bat for you. There is not sense of urgency and we have been lied to every step of the way. My reccomendation is to get your own financing. They are horrible to deal with. We were scheduled to close 6 weeks ago and have just had to switch to a private lender since they continued to string us along.The stress has been incredible.On the quality of workmanship I would give a 5 start rating, The options three stars and the TBI lender zero stars.

I visited here today to check out the cars. I absolutely loved this place, and will be referring to everyone I come across looking for a car! They have beautiful cars that are in very good shape. Clean interior and exteriors. Very good prices; they have the best prices out of everywhere I've looked (and I've been looking for a while.) After coming just once I bought a beautiful E320 Mercedes Benz. It runs beautifully, very smoothly. It's a 2003, but looks and runs like it's practically new it's in such good shape. The workers here are friendly and held a very professional yet comfortable atmosphere. The dealership is very clean, as are the cars. I am very happy with my purchase, and with this dealership. I definitely recommend to everyone and anyone that is looking to find a beautiful used car that is at a great price. Very fortunate to have came across this place.

By far the worst property management company I have ever rented from. Tried to scam us several different times including trying to charge us for a service call that they claimed the appliance company was charging them. I verified with the appliance company that there was no charge to MBA. At move out they Initially charged us $1500 on top of our deposit including $800 to reprint the house which is illegal since we had been there over a year. We left the house cleaner then it was at move in with improved landscaping. Even if you love the property, it's worth walking away from and finding something different. You will regret renting from MBA.

This is the best Mexican food I've had in Charlotte since moving here from California. Having lived in LA, I have very high standards as far as Mexican food is concerned. Their staff is very friendly and greet you as soon as you come in. I've had their asada, carnitas and chorizo tacos and they're okay. Their chile rojo is pretty good, it's also really spicy so if you can't take heat I'd stay away from that. Their chile verde is okay. I had their chile rojo wet burrito and it was pretty good as well. I was hesitant after reading all the mixed reviews but decided to give them a try. Just as everyone else says, don't be fooled by the location of the place. It's in a small strip mall and you can possibly miss it but overall it's good. I'll be returning to try other items on the menu.

We were traveling, and we lost our luggage -including all our dog toys and 
dog food. Our dog is VERY PARTICULAR. Just the way he is. A friend suggested Little Bear. Charles was amazing. He played with Mauser (our dog), showed him different plush toys and bones, and even gave us a dog sweater to make sure he was warm. And the funniest thing is that before, Mauser would only eat Natural Balance. Charles suggested Wild Calling. We tried it and now it's the only thing Mauser will eat. He has more energy and a shinier coat. Thanks Little Bear!!

We went for brunch on a Sunday morning after reading about Border Grill in Vegas/Rated magazine.  For $24.99 you get an all-you-can-eat brunch - but this isn't your usual Vegas buffet - everything is made to order and served tapas style.  

We started with the fresh fruit plate and guava empanada.  The guava empanada was heavenly...the filling was almost like a guava cream cheese.  Next, we tried the chilaquiles and the green corn tamale.  The green corn tamale is sweet and delicious with just a little sour cream.  We followed this with the Yucatan eggs benedict - not as delicious as all of my fellow Yelpers let on - and the steak and eggs.  My husband was a huge fan of the steak and eggs...I think he only shared one bite.  The breakfast enchilada and the chorizo and egg taco were last.  I am not a huge chorizo fan so I did not enjoy the taco, but the breakfast enchilada was amazing.  The chicken was so flavorful and tender and I loved the cotija cheese.  For dessert, we ordered the coconut french toast, which was a perfect ending to a fabulous meal...just the right amount of sweet.  

Our server was tremendous - very sweet and always there with a refill for my all-you-can-drink mimosas (only $5!).  The passionfruit one is incredible - I may have overindulged!

Check out restaurant.com to see if they have a gift certificate available.  We got a $25 gift certificate for $10 before we went.

I can't go to Vegas without hitting up Sushi Roku...I love everything about it, from the service to the drinks (my favorite is the Tokyo Cooler, although the Pineapple Upside Down Cake martini is a close second) and the view and the food (hanabi, I dream about you!).  

On my most recent visit, my husband and I went for happy hour on a Monday afternoon.  Happy hour is only available at the bar, but it is an amazing deal!  We had a spicy tuna roll and the rock shrimp and jalapeno roll.  Roku has the best spicy tuna of any sushi place I have ever visited.  We also had the popcorn shrimp - ask for a side of spicy mayo to make this even more delicious - and the miso eggplantt.  They even have dessert on their HH menu and how can you go wrong with a mini chocolate volcano cake?

We went to Scarpetta to celebrate our 9 year anniversary. As requested, they gave us a table so we could see the Bellagio fountains.  Our reservation was at 9 PM and we were disappointed to find out that the chef was no longer offering the tasting menu that evening. Our waiter, however, said we could create our own tasting - excellent!  

We started with the polenta with mushrooms - delicious, but it maybe could have used a bit more salt. Next up was the infamous $24 spaghetti. Well worth it - this is the best pasta I ever ate. Since we were indulging, the next course was more pasta. The duck and foie gras ravioli. It was good, but very rich and not even close to as good as the beef cheek ravioli from Carnevino. I am not sure why people would compare the two. On carb overload we then had the lamb which was fantastic. For some reason they also sent out a duck entree which we had not ordered. Not a fan of the spices - cardamom and clove. Nor was I a fan of the waiter attempting to charge us for it. 
Dessert was the chocolate salted caramel cake. Good, but nothing to rave about. 

Wine prices are high but on par with everything else on the strip. 

Oh, I almost forgot the bread basket and dipping sauces. The Stromboli bread with salami and cheese is phenomenal. The marscapone butter could make even cheap white bread taste good. 

Definitely worth a visit to try the spaghetti. I will be going back for that!

After eating at Scarpetta, I had high expectations for this place.  Unfortunately, it left a bad taste in my mouth - even the bread was meh.  

I had the Pici with duck sauce as it was highly yelped about.  The noodles though were too thick and a little too al dente.  The sauce was overwhelming and so rich it made it difficult to eat much.

My friend had the carpaccio, which was very bland.  

The dessert menu was so underwhelming that we passed - which never happens!

I wish we had hit up Scarpetta instead!

i wasn't in an objective frame of mind, given that i was a visitor from another state and was willing to try just about anything local. that said, this place left a smile on my face.

maybe it was the 1950s-era big neon sign out front. maybe it was the fiberglass horse on the roof. maybe it was the kitchy old-school cowboy-themed decor inside. maybe it was the fact that our waitress wore a holster and 6-shooter. or maybe it was the sawdust all over the floor.

side note: sawdust? really? WHY? aren't they concerned about people slipping and hurting themselves?

we ordered breakfast and it was good. it's hard to screw up eggs, hash browns, and bacon, and they didn't. yum.

i'm glad we didn't go to IHOP.

Food Is good. Service is slow. Large salads and sandwiches  with plentiful sides. Burger was cook ed as ordered. Their special sauce is killer good. Peppery spicy alone but on the burger is fantastic.  Cuban sandwich is large and filling and delicious. Brownie Ala mode is enough for two, maybe three. Order dessert only if you are not pressed for time. Took over 30 min to get dessert menu, order and stated eating.  It will take 1 hour for entree and another for dessert. Hard to get into a lunch hour.

We had the Chicken Bacon Avocado wrap that was stuffed full of chunks of chicken, crunchy bacon bits, some avocado and lots of lettuce and skin-on cucumbers chunks.  Next time I'll tell them to leave those off.  Kind of dry so needed more mayo that they supplied in packets.  The pesto chicken Cavatappi was delicious but small portion.  It  should include a side or at least a piece of bread.

As an out of state bidder I can state that J. Levine Auctions provided one of the most courteous and professional telephone bid experiences I have had in over 40 years buying at auction in Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris and other venues. J. Levine's service is simply outstanding. I highly recommend doing business with them.

What a great experience for anyone needing any type of print services. I am a graphic designer and I have ordered from them before. They have been very helpful anytime I've needed help by phone or through chat. I am ordering again and Tina has been more than helpful on the phone even letting me know about their current promotions. I will be using them any time I need anything printed.

Great work done.  Had them run 3 lines of cat6 for high speed networking.  Also made a wiring cabinet in our upstairs master bedroom so all lines could be connected.  Also had them move an in-ceiling speaker to a different location and mount TV.  Was great work.  I love asking questions and the installers answered them all professionally without getting annoyed. Fast response, fast scheduling and fast implementation.  Will certainly use again when I need to run more cable in my home.

Amazing service. The team at pure plumbing came out to check on a few things on the house I just purchased.  They looked at a old water softener system that was no longer functional. After discussion, they suggested a new system that provides softening and filtration.  I did NOT feel pressured for purchase.  Instead, they gave me all the information and allowed me to make my own decision.  After giving the thumbs up, they were back in a couple of hours SAME DAY with the new system and got it all installed.  All questions I had about other repairs on the property (replacing outdoor piping, checking for leaks, etc) were answered without ego or frustration.

Another problem they found was I had a leak in my laundry room that had been present for quite some time.  It caused damage to the drywall and required repair.  They referred me to an excellent service and repaired the leak by installing new valves.

A couple days later, after moving in and getting my washer and dryer installed, I called AFTERHOURS and was surprised to get a callback almost immediately.  They came out next day to install the gas line for my dryer and check my gas fireplace quickly.

This service is amazing.  Had no issues and would certainly recommend them again.

I don't usually take the time to share negative experiences however this one is unusually bad...I wish I could go back in time and choose any other hotel and save what was supposed to be a fun time in Vegas.  Parking is confusing and signs point you in general direction but stop short of guiding into the connected garage. I ended up parking in their overflow lot and walking half a mile through a winding set of corridors, elevator trips and turns to get to the front desk. It probably took me 20 minutes from car to front desk (if you decide to stay here, pay a few extra dollars and valet!). Next I learn my reservation didn't exist in their system. I showed several email confrmations and they promised to fix by the time I checked out in the morning. When I get up and attempt to check out, I come to find they have double charged me for the room and refused to call Hotwire to resolve.  The rooms are really nice, especially for the price, but be prepared to walk an extensive amount and struggle through the most complex set of twists, turns, multiple elevator rides and frustration to get to your room. It took us 10-15 minutes to reach our room each time we entered the property. Avoid this place like the plague if you value your time and courteous staff that doesn't make their problems the customers.

It was ok. I had the Loco Moco and it was good, but wasn't that great. I'll probably go for a steak and egg breakfast or one of the waffles or something next time. The serving for the chicken and waffles is huge too, biggest I've ever seen.

However, for being a breakfast place, they need to step up their coffee game. This is some of the weakest and worst coffee I've ever had and that alone makes me not want to come back with so many options nearby.

I find the last review (Riki L.) Very comical. I happen to be in the store the day she came in trying to pick up her table on that Sunday. Her paperwork clearly said Monday and she had the wrong day. In fact I had to stop getting customer service so they could help her. She was yelling through the store and cussing at them using profanity I had my children in there. Total white trash is how she acted. I had to stay in the store until after they closed because of her stunt going over to the other store. She went to pick up her table at the 59th Ave. and Bell location she put it in her truck and she left and never paid for.  The owners daughter on the E. Bell Rd. location called her several times as I was sitting right in front of her. Rik never picked up her phone. I would say in the 15 minutes before she called the police she had to have called for probably 10 times. She knew she owed the money when she loaded the table she should have paid for it then. Howie world was left with nothing left but to call the police to protect themselves. I have never seen someone in my life be so rude to people in a store as this Riki was. Howie world was not rude to her or mean to her. She wanted them to deliver something on a different day and hour before closing. And it simply could not have been done. Riki Did not read her paperwork for the delivery date she messed up and she wanted them to take the blame for it And she drove the other location picked up the merchandise and didn't pay for. You never know who's watching who's going to read these reviews it truly helps to be honest!

Solid 4. 

Typically, there is not much on this planet that excites me more than fresh, local, organic ingredients on a sandwich, but when I can have that and a salad bar I am a happy little tree-hugger. 

Jason's is an all-time favorite sandwich place of mine and of my fellow vegan foodie. The portabello wrappini (hold the cheese, please) and the salad bar with their black currant tea are the keys to the good life for lunch and a mid-afternoon craving for a friggin' good sandwich. (And of course, the occasional slide on the vegan diet for a much needed fill of cheese that can only be satisfied by their french onion or tomato basil soup- yummo). 

A few bummers-  the lack of veggie sandwich options ( I think there are only 3 or 4), which is why I pretty much order the same thing every time. But having this in mind, I haven't been displeased going there for my mushroom wrappini. 

This is a good place to take anyone because they have stuff that everyone likes (even pasta for those who don't want a sandwich- in which case you should rush them to the nearest hospital because something ain't right- who goes to a damn deli and doesn't get a sandwich?). 

cheers and happy sandwiching, 
the vegan foodies

Horrible service. First, I wanted it to go and it was presented to me for dine in. Second, the sandwich was wrong, even after I asked if it was a BLT with Avocado. Good thing I checked before I left. And there was no acknowledgement of the inconvenience and wait time. That goes a long way. Will likely find another Einstein to go to.

This is probably one of my worst restaurant experiences. I ordered the food at 8.50 PM for home delivery and they never turned up even after 10.00 PM. When I oridred, they told me that they would deliver the food in 45 mins to 1 hour. When i tried calling them at 10, they were closed. Never ever order food here. The worst thing I had paid for the food but never got it.

Obviously not worth going to Vegas unless you are rich, and this club exemplars that statement. Kaskade good DJ and some others, but really overall this club is all right.

The staff is all super friendly. The atmosphere isnt divey, depending on who else is eating there. I really like their Pho. It is great when you are not feeling well and will most likely leave you feeling better. I always get it with meat but end up getting seconds and thirds of their rice noodles before even touching the meat. The soup is so delicious by itself.

I have had the distinct pleasure of working with Jonathan during a recent shoot. Being an internationally published fitness/bikini model, I have been blessed to work with so many photographers and Jonathan is one of the best! He stayed in communication with me leading up the shoot and came ready with ideas on the images he wanted to create.  Our shoot was long, taking advantage of our paths crossing, and he afforded breaks whenever required.  Incredibly fun and incredibly comfortable, I was very pleased with the whole atmosphere. 

His images are ALWAYS beautiful and I was so anxious to see some of the work and he didn't disappoint!! I received several shots in a timely manner and THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!! MAGAZINE QUALITY FOR SURE!! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!

Wow! I love BRAND STEAKHOUSE!! My husband and I went here for our 1st wedding anniversary. The food was absolutely perfect. The service was top notch. 
We began with the hot rocks appetizer. The steak was thin sliced and had a marinade that was full of flavor. You cook the steak to your liking and eat. Wonderful idea.. After the appetizer, I had the wedge salad. The presentation was beautiful and the flavors were consistent and well balanced. Yum. My husband had the caesar which he enjoyed.
We both had the Filet Mignon medium which was cooked to perfection. The side sauces were so good and really brought out flavors of the meat. We ordered the asparagus, the mac and cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes. My favorite was the mac and cheese... Seriously, I wish I had the recipe.. They were amazing!! The asparagus was not soggy which I find is the case alot of times. They had a fire roasted flavor which I enjoyed. The garlic mashed potatoes were great also.. some of the best I've had.
Overall I think that Brand Steakhouse is one of the best steakhouses that I've eaten at. It should be in the top five of Las Vegas... I will definitely go back. I dream about the Filet with their signature steak sauces and the baked Mac and Cheese. 
The atmosphere was also something to be admired. I kind of relaxed yet elegant feeling. Just perfect.

I have mixed reviews about Gardunos. The bean dip is really amazing which keeps me coming back for more. It is addictive....
The food however could use a little love. I did have success with the steak fajitas this last visit and those where great! The steak was tender and full of juicy flavor... 
The beef enchiladas need help. They are flavorless, dry and very spicy. 
I would never order their tomale ever again since they add food coloring to make it a turquise blue color for some reason... It just seems wrong.. and is probably unhealthy.
I also feel that the pricing is a little high for mexican food. Im sure that they get away with overpricing their dishes because their main clientel is tourists but as a local, they need to have better food or lower their pricing.

The selection of wine is great! I am a Sommelier and choose Roys because he is always seeking out what the customer wants. He has a large variety of many regional wines, old world and new world.. He has a great beer selection including my favorite IPAs and seasonal selections.. If he doesn't have it, he will get it!! The cigar room is amazing.. I haven't seen one as pristine and well stocked as this..

If your looking for a local wine/ liquor/ cigar shop... this is the place.

I love Chipotle!!!!! The food here is excellent. You also cannot beat the price anywhere. The company is very respectful and practice their Food with Integrity motto. I think it is great to see a restaurant care as much about the source of their product as they do about what goes into their pocket. Many other companies should take note. 
The steak, chicken, pork and barbacoa are incredible. All slow cooked to perfection, the flavor profile of every ingredient that goes into each meal is compromised. 
I normally order the bowl here which i order with rice, black beans, med salsa, corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and guacamole. Yuuummm...
So good and always enough left over for late night snacking. The chips here are fresh and perfectly salted and the salsas are full of flavor.
I will forever be a loyal customer at Chipotle!!

First of all, Pico Madama has the Moxie crew but is in a new location. Very professional as always. The salon is very clean and somewhat retro. 

My husband has been going to Ama for about a year now for his hair cuts. He will not go to anyone else. She is very meticulous and always does an incredible job. I finally took his advice and had a haircut done by Ama yesterday... I am amazed by the quality of services she rendered!! She understood exactly what I was looking for. I had a gloss treatment done as well and now my hair is as shiny, healthy, and lustrous as it's ever been.

I would absolutely recommend Ama if you are looking for a quality haircut!!!

I love Buon Gusto Ristorante! 

My husband and I had dinner here for the first time a few days ago and I am so glad we did! From the moment you walk in the door you feel as though you've walked out from Las Vegas and into a quant yet classy restaurant somewhere in Italy. The staff was also very professional and quick to fulfill every need. 

Right away our server brought out fresh, hot sliced bread with olive oil, garlic and balsamic... Wow! Great start to our meal.. I ordered the pasta with garlic and olive oil which included a salad with their house made ranch(which was creamy and delicious). My husband had the lasagna which came out piping hot.. still boiling in the pan.. I can definitely say that the lasagna was the best I've tasted.. the presentation being a plus. His dinner also included a salad which he upgraded to a caesar salad. To top our meal off, we had Chef Joel's signature bread pudding for dessert. WOW!!!! I would come back specifically for this dish. It was served hot with an addicting rum sauce as well as freshly made whipped cream that had been frozen to deliciousness. 
 
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. We cant wait to return.

I really love Archie's Thai Kitchen. My husband and I have been going to the Flamingo location for years.. We normally order the Pad Woon Sen, the beef fried rice and the wonton soup which is incredible..
We have had unpleasant experiences here at this location several times now. It is closer to our house than the Flamingo or Rainbow location so we really wanted it to be more convenient for us. Sadly enough, every time we go here our order comes out wrong. We order a spicy number 6 and no spice is added, we order a spicy number 4 and it burns our heads off. We don't run into this problem at any other location. 
We have also been to this location and it is super busy and their is no one to help us sit or order food. 
New management is needed here. They really need to change these things. I would love to frequent this restaurant but find that it is hard to trust that our food will be done consistently.

This McDonalds needs help...

I used to travel alot and Mcdonalds was always the "go to" fast food restaurant for us. Always consistant food and fast convenient service.

This branch is a very poorly run store. The last few times I have gone thru the drive thru the man taking the order was very rude. (the same person i think).. Could not seem to awnser any questions or be polite in any such way. And the food was sub par.

Two nights ago, we went to grab a quick snack wrap.. We were greated by a big man who had a very poor attitude. I thought maybe he was just having a bad night?? As we pulled to the counter to grab our order a car from the drive thru went around us to leave. He actually yelled at the man who takes orders that he needed to learn how to treat customers. I then knew that the rudeness that was suspected was not just my imagination.. 

Tonight was the absolute last time I will ever go here.. We went thru the drive thru around 12:00 AM and for some reason the man who normally takes the order said that they would be closed for 15 minutes for a break??? This is supposed to be a 24 hour location. I wasn't sure if he said 15 or 50 minute break so I asked him when they would re-open to have him yell 15 back in the headset? Some seriously bad service. 
 
I will pass the word on that this location has inconsistant food and horrible service. The management at this fast food branch should be fired as well as the employees who seem to think that yelling at customers and treating them poorly is okay to do.

The salad bar is fun and they have a pretty descent variety of offerings.
The soups are always great. The chili which was one of my favorites, the chicken pot pie, the beef stew,and the tortilla chicken. Jasons Deli always hits the spot when you are looking for a quick and healthy meal.

I also LOVE that they have introduced their healthy initiative.. Yay Jason's Deli!! I am a loyal customer!!

The atmosphere here is nice. Good variety of music. My fiance and I came in for a late night meal. I had the cheeseburger with onion rings. I do like all the additional items you can add to the Burger. I added grilled onions, Swiss, and mushrooms. In all my meal was pretty good. We started off with the chicken wings which were also pretty good. The service was the best feature here. The only complaint I have is that the staff was hanging around the bar getting drunk. It seemed pretty unprofessional and kind of rude.

Wow!!!!!! This place is incredible! Its like a chocolate heaven. The menu is full of a variety of food (not just chocolate). I had the club sandwich which was served with Chipotle Mayo(yum) as well as waffle fries sprinkled with chili and cocoa powder! The fries were great. I had the eighties chocolate shake with my meal. Soooo good!!! I can honestly say that that was the best shake I've ever had! After my meal I tried the chocolate popsicle fondue. Amazing. 
I would highly recommend Max Brenner to anyone.

I have been here 3 times absolutely love the food and smoothies! Tastes so good its almost unbelievable that it is all healthy! Also, the service I received each time was awesome and fast. The tall blonde boy helped me each time and explained a lot about the menu and suggested his favorites. Will be recommending to all my friends and family:)

It was a disappointing experience when I patronized the Thai Express at Bayview Village. I ordered a Noodle Soup and a Stir Fry. The noodle soup was so-so but the Stir Fry was a disappointment. This happened on Oct 25th afternoon - please refer to the attached picture of receipt. First, the chef thought it was just stir fry with no rice, and later on someone came over and put the rice back and gave the dish back to me with no apology. The Cashier was not interested in saying hello or trying to promote what's good in the restaurant. She didn't want to look at us in the eye - it's a bit rude honestly. Well, the owner smiled but that's the person who cared. 

Back to the Stir fry, take a look at what we got vs. what's up there on the menu board. The menu board stir fry looks a lot better - nice pieces of beef with broccoli and fresh veggie. Look at what I got! Lots of bean sprouts, which were not cooked very well. I was told it's the way they make it - it's Thai. Yes, it's true, but the bean sprouts reeks because it's not cooked well. Why? It's not fresh!!!!

Anyway, I was about to complain but when I checked out the Pad Thai another customer got across from my stable. It's merely two pieces of shrimp mixed with noodles. It didn't look too good either. I was like, well, I might as well save my breath. 

I mean, I have been a Thai Express fan since the day it was born. I like your Mini Soups and your Noodle Soups. Once in a while I visit your restaurants, but this time, it's the huge disappointment. Your menus aren't cheap. It's comparable to a fine dining Thai restaurant and I expect something better. 

If you wish to keep us as frequent customers, you have to do a better job.

Interesting Place! 
I love the Shrimp Soup and the sausage in 'flame'. We should have had the Seafood Platter but instead we got the steak. The owner was friendly and so were the staff, but super busy place on a Saturday night. Great place for casual Portuguese dining.

A great team with Dr. D.  They always make my daughters feel comfortable and they explain everything to me and my husband.  We are still in treatment with our oldest daughters but I am confident that her smile will be fabulous!  Dr. D is a top notch orthodontist and his staff is friendly, professional and efficient.  All concerns are addressed promptly and with compassion and care.  I would not take my daughters anywhere else.

Nothing special about their Indian food and costly!

Ordered butter chicken and asked twice if it came with rice. Both times they said yes. Walked over to pickup the order and brought it back to my place to eat to only find out that there was no rice!!! Called and told them that they forgot my rice and told them to give me discount. They said no. So told them to deliver and waited but they never came!!!!

This is probably one of the best restaurants in all of Toronto. Do what we did and you won't regret it. We didn't want to pick from the menu instead told them to pick for us including the wine. We were 6 people.

It was out of this world! L'Unita has some crazy talent in the front and in the kitchen. Their manager and sommelier, Rob is one talented son of a bitch. He chose some amazing dishes and perfect wine to pair and kept it all reasonable without gouging!

If you haven't tried L'Unita then you have missed out on some amazing food porn!

Yes...the service sucks. Yes...the ambiance leaves you wanting "more"....but who cares! The food is amazeballs! Best chips and salsa in town and I have never had a bad thing off the menu. This is legit Mexican food and if you are a foodie, you will not be able to shut up about how good your food is while you are eating it. I hope the bad service and horrible decor don't kill this restaurant because the thought of never having those flour chips again makes me wanna cry.

So...I'm not usually one to frequent corporate restaurants....but I can't stay away from those dang frozen margaritas! If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't eat here half as much. I would give the menu 3 stars, but there are two great things on the menu. The chili pork verde and the diablo chicken pasta. Can't go wrong there...and the Tejas trio is great to snack on if you just want a small bite.

There are so many great things to say about working with Rebecca to find your new place in Toronto.

As an international renter, the idea of trying to find a place to live in a very hot real estate market was beyond daunting. I did some research online and time and again the advice I came across was to get a realtor. This then led to the next challenge: how would I choose my realtor? 

And to Yelp I went. Rebecca's name popped up near the top with great reviews stating how professional and involved she was (both very true). Upon visiting her website, I was instantly struck by how straightforward and open she seemed. Her bio is down-to-earth and includes details that make you feel comfortable and like you're about to get down to work with an old friend.

To me, she was the obvious first and only choice. I'm so glad I picked her! 

After sending her a detailed email of my situation and rental needs, she replied promptly and with positivity, reassuring me that while my situation was unique, it was hardly impossible. She set to work adding me to a database that would email me potential rentals that featured the specific things I was looking for. So awesome to be able to apartment hunt from your inbox! 

I did indeed find the perfect place, and I couldn't have done it without Rebecca. She made communicating with the landlords and their realtors a breeze and was able to prepare the lease and handle other details, freeing me to focus on other things associated with an international move.

Rebecca actually cares about her clients, and finding them the right rental or forever home is both her goal and her specialty. If you are looking to rent or buy, Rebecca should be your go-to choice.

As a recent transplant to TO, I was worried about finding the right shop to process and purchase film. THIS IS THE PLACE! 

Because I'm strictly a film photographer, I was looking to find a store that would offer great support in terms of my analog needs. I tried one other place in the city and was disappointed by their crappy customer service and the fact that they kept their film stock hidden away from view. 

Not at Downtown Camera. With a wall made of vintage cameras and a range of films right out in the open, I knew this was going to be a good fit.

Not only do they have E6 outlab services, their turnaround time for film processed in-house is quick, and you can receive text or email updates to know when your film is ready. And they offer a punch card (for in-house developing only) to keep track of the film you've dropped off -
 once you've hit your ninth roll, your tenth is free! 

Seriously, if you are still shooting film, are only shooting film, or just getting into shooting film, this is your go-to lab and photo store! With so many places choosing to only cater to digital shooters and doing away with film processing altogether, we need to take care of the stores that are taking care of us! Make your film cameras happy, come into Downtown Camera! :)

*UPDATE*
As I've been taking more and more advantage of the film processing services at Downtown Camera, I've become aware of a few issues that I find problematic. Thus why I've felt the need to alter my original review. First, the customer service is very touch and go. Some days I go in, and it's fantastic. Other days, it's as if the person behind the counter is going through the motions. The assistance you receive is never consistent, and that's pretty much a bummer. Second, and even more disheartening, is the fact that next day film service at Downtown Camera is now three or even four days processing time, something that seemed to have started within the past month. I inquired about it possibly being due to a large influx of film to be processed, but the person behind the counter claimed that this was the norm. Not sure how next day can be advertised as such, but I do know that there are other film processing places in TO that will develop your film either that day or the very next day, dependent on how early in the morning you drop off, and that is their regular service. Just a few things to consider when assessing your film processing needs.

I'm new to Toronto and wanted to get a pair of boots for the upcoming fall and winter season. I looked online and saw that this store carried Blundstone boots. The official Blundstone site even listed this shop as having the boots I wanted - #584 - in stock. 

And then I went inside. The saleswoman wasn't what I'd call warm, but coming from NYC, I can be used to brusque salespeople. She informed me that they did not have my size in that particular boot in stock, but that I could check back in September. I then asked if I could try on another pair of Blundstones just to see how they feel on your feet since I've never owned a pair. The saleslady seemed put off. She told me that they wouldn't fit the same as the winter boots. I told her, I was aware of that, but if I was in the store, I'd still like to try a pair on to see if I even like the brand, especially if I was to wait until September for the ones I want. These boots aren't cheap either, so yeah, trying any pair on can give some insight into their fit.

She actually continued to dissuade me from trying them on. Someone whose very job revolves around getting people to buy shoes. It was confusing and she came off seeming like I was putting her out by asking her to pull a box of boots from the back. 

I repeated again that, if I'm going to spend that much money, I want to know what I'm getting into, and would like to know how any iteration of the boots fit. She finally acquiesced and went and got me the boots.

While all of this was going on, I felt awful. Unwelcome and unwanted. There was literally one other customer in the store with her mom. And me, being treated like I'm dumb for wanting to try on a pair of shoes.

I can say that many other stores in Toronto sell Blundstone boots and I would suggest if you would like to experience being treated with respect and decency, to avoid this store. Especially as a new arrival to this city, this kind of experience leaves me feeling flummoxed and bummed out. 

I should point out that I proceeded to pop into five or so other shops after going into this store, and every salesperson that greeted me did so with enthusiasm and kindness and provided exemplary customer service.

We all make choices with our wallets. I personally wouldn't spend my money or my time in this store in the future, as they made it very clear that I wasn't worth theirs.

* Fast - I was in and out in less than 10 minutes.
* Friendly - I've never met someone so genuinely kind and interesting all in one go. And he loves taking photos, so the experience becomes something special.
* Fantastic - The photos are fabulous. He really does a wonderful job making sure you leave satisfied. 

Get to Chinatown, climb the stairs up to the studio, and you'll have the best looking passport photo you're ever going to find!

Wow! This place is amazing! A great running store, yes, but the nicest people around also happen to be staffing it.

I went in with questions about running clubs in the area and left with new shoes. The entire process couldn't have been easier. The woman helping me was genuinely kind, answered all my questions, and was quick to bring out any pair of shoes that she thought might work for me and my running style. She even helped me determine whether I've been pronating/supinating with their bio-mechanical analysis. She was thorough and friendly and it made my time in the store pleasant and super enjoyable.

If you're on the market for new running shoes, gear or just have questions about getting together with other runners, this should be your go-to spot.

I called several places after my car accident and Craig P Kenny was the first person to call me back in record time. My lawyer Lawrence Mittin and his assistant Joli Hanks are the very best. 
They will take such good care of you that I thought I was related to the owner of the company.
They kept telling me just get better and we will take care of everything else. Thier main concern was for me not to worry and leave everything to them. They took care of  insurance companies, doctors, medical bills, etc. This is a firm that doesn't advertise on tv or radio but I found by the grace of god. The whole staff is the best and will work hard for you and really care about you as a person. When I was told that they settled my case I finally cried.  They are amazing!!!.  I ended up with a generous settlement to make sure that I will be well cared for in the future. I would definitely recommend their services to anyone. Thank you again Lawrence Mittin and Joli Hanks!

This place is awful!!!  A friend told me about their sale on Botox so I thought I'd try it - buyer beware. I have NEVER, EVER had a place doing botox treatments DEMAND my credit card number while making an appointment.  They said it was incase I cancelled and that hotels do this all the time....um, I'm getting botox, not booking a room.  When I arrived, you have to sign in and state whether you're paying by card or cash which I thought was odd.  I met with the Nurse who was to do the treatment and she was nice enough.  She gave me the quote and I agreed.  Before she would even start, she said she had to have my credit card to take to the front desk to be run BEFORE treatment.  Seriously???!!!!!  I was treated like some deadbeat criminal!  I gave her my card, then had to wait while the front desk ran my card for the amount.  Obviously the charge went through without problem, but the experience left me disgusted with Suddenly Slimmer.  I drove 90+ miles to come to this place and I wouldn't come back if the Botox was free.  The office staff is rude in that they don't even acknowledge you when you enter the place and sign in.  The Botox was ok at best, but the service was deplorable!  STAY AWAY!

I stayed at the Baymont Inn And Suites during a recent weekend visit to Las Vegas. The service was wonderful, the rooms were functionally pleasing with free WiFi, free lobby-located web service, large screen TVs, reliable maid service, a pool, and a reasonably priced gym.

The hotel is located in walking distance to shops, department stores, and drug stores. It is also located only 4 miles from the strip. I thoroughly enjoyed the accommodations and the service.

I'm a fan of reviewing based on expected results (in other words I wouldn't rate a fast/carryout place based on formal restaurant expectations).  That being said, the establishment was decent (as good or better than expected for a non-formal dining setting) and the food that I got in the lunch special was terrific. The basmati rice has a great flavor that went well with their curries.  With a range from somewhat spicy to very spicy, the flavor was delicious across the two curries and the soup/curry (whatever the third item in the lunch special was today).  The naan was average; I have had some better naan, but it served its purpose alongside the curries. The rice pudding (Kheer maybe?) was pretty good, but I'm not a big dessert person so I could take it or leave it, but it was nice after the spicy curries. The place was clean, I ordered and had my food within about 5 minutes or less and the guy taking orders was friendly.  This was $8 for lunch (with plenty left for dinner) that did not disappoint.

I can't believe this place is still in business. As others have noted they have been NO-SHOWS FOR THE 3RD DAY IN A ROW. Entirely unprofessional doesn't even begin to describe their phone manner. Nobody is willing to accept responsibility for their horrible INCONSISTENT AND UNRELIABLE service. Do your self a favour and absolutely DO NOT give this company your money, they don't deserve it. Absolute waste of time. I cannot wait to see this company go out of business. I wish I could give this company ZERO STARS

Omg! I love this place, amazing food, service, and friendly staff. My boyfriend and I come here quite a bit you have to get the avocado egg rolls they are the bomb ! Served with chili line sauce and chicken pot stickers but I would ask for the sauce on the side.for some reason the potstickers are swimming in the sauce  if ordered in original form.  If you decided to get a strawberry lemonade make sure to ask for water because it's overly  sweet. Entrees I got the luau salad it's amazing very healthy and he got the teriyaki chicken so good comes with your choice of brow., Or white rice . Lastly our server was very nice and attentive but seemed to be overwhelmed so we felt bad asking for anything.

Okay Let me start by saying that reason I am giving this place a two star was service first thing I call to ask if they serve food all night and what the hours were the bartender on the phone was a female this is her exact words "Yes this is a BAR we are 24hrs and serve food all day" I said okay thank you and she hung up no good bye or thank nada! So, I am starving I just got home from working on the strip and I work at Bar too that closes at one in the morning that is why I called to ask. My husband and I walk inside and sit right in front of the bar at one of the high tops it was 15 mins before anyone came to greet us or give us any menus. Finally, a male bartender came and greeted us he was friendly but was in a rush to get our order he just handed us the menu and asked "Do you know what you want?" We needed a min and did not ask if we wanted some thing to drink or nothing just "I assumed you been here before". Retarded how can you say that to a guest. So, he came around sooner than I thought to take our order the way it was going we asked for it to go. I ordered the chicken dinner with rice and veggies; my man got a bucket of buffalo wings with extra buffalo on the side and an order of fried cheese. Then he asks do you want a drink while you wait we both said no it is okay.( In my head you'd probably bring it when the food is ready anyway.)  So it took 30 to 45 mins for the bar food to come out; we had paid before hand too and had to go up to the bar to ask the bartender how much longer that's when he finally got the food. I guess he noticed we gave him 20% and was extremely fast and nice I walked out My husband stayed to get some ranch to go. When we get home his wings were PLAIN we hand to melt butter and mix it with franks to toss the wings in to make them buffalo. Other than that the food was good the veggies did not seem fresh if anything they are frozen or canned. This review got two stars because the male bartender was nice and food was okay.

Daisy carpet cleaning has done an amazing job for many years with us. How is a responsible owner and owns up to his 30 years of experience. He has cleaned all of our homes that we have rented and taken out almost impossible stains. In our last condo we had gotten our new puppy lucky who made a lot of accidents on our carpet pee stains, poop stains, as well as chewed up the carpet by the front door. Joe was able to come clean it while we were at work we trusted him to let himself in and just do his thing he notified us once he got there and also called when he was finished. When we came home the carpet looked almost new he said that it was tuff to clean he had to bring down the scrubber, put in some special chemicals for the pet stains and odors and as for the chewed up carpet he suggested either patching it or just replacing the whole area. Other than that it looked amazing! thank you joe for your wonderful service.

Horrible customer service. The staff always have attitude and are not helpful at all especially the manager. I ordered the low fat mango smoothie. Although the store promotes a healthy attitude towards food and appears to use the freshest ingredients this place is far from healthy. The person making my smoothie jus poured in some sugar filled mixture into the blender and added sugar filled frozen yogurt. This drink was full of preservatives and sugar. Definitely not worth the calories or the price. And I could do without the attitude.

Tips - wear comfortable shoes and clothes.  You will walk and walk and walk - you get the picture. I would take a blanket and a picnic lunch and a refillable water bottle is a must.
Give yourself 4-6 hours to look around - all day if you want to see the entire park.
I LOVED the insectorium!
We were there for the lantern show which was a nice little bonus, although it was a bit crowded.
Easy walk from metro Pie IX

Great park - we could sit and watch these silly squirrels play for hours.  Seriously the most hilarious squirrels I have ever encountered.
We had coffee at the little cafe one morning and it was so relaxing to sit in this park and people watch.
We came here twice during our 4 day stay - so glad we happened upon this park!

The Nutella crepe with bananas and strawberries was great!  My husband got the bagel sandwich with egg and cheese.  I was a little disappointed in the lack of vegetarian options if you weren't in the mood for something sweet.  They had tons of combo options that looked delicious but not a single one was veggie - boo. 
We enjoyed our breakfast.

The food was exceptional. I had the omelette with feta, spinach, shallots, and tomato which came with potatoes, fruit, toast, and coffee. My husband had the Mexican burrito which came with potatoes and fruit. The service was very good - we went on a Tuesday around 11am and there was no wait.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for brunch!

As I said POOR SERVICE! you go anywhere and don't receive some sort of refund for the wrong food will always be in the wrong. And surely to deal with an attitude on top of receiving the wrong food is insane. Once again as I said they lost my business and every coworker  from my job because they knew they would probably do something such as spit in their food .. I didn't give them that reputation their attitudes did.

I was a huge fan of Champps  and when they closed wanted to find a similar sports bar that sold Potato Skins. I went on a hunt an this was one of the places that I tried. First issue was there was no were to park. We ended up parking were it might have been considered the side walk.(Good thing we were only doing takeout). I got 4 skins. Now they were a great size but they had no taste to them at all. It was undercooked and there was more potato then anything. I will give this place another try because I love sports bars but i'd probably try something else.

This place was nice on the eyes... an that's were it stopped. After being seated it had taken a while to place orders, we didn't get bread until we asked for it as we happened to catch the waitress walking passed. Then we got bread an side salad with the meal. There was a weird smell coming from the butter an shortly after not finishing half of my meal, I felt sick an resulted in vomit. I love trying new things but I regret to say the service as well as food gets a thumbs down for me.

Let me start by saying I love Taco Bell, but this one is the worst one I've ever been to. More often then not when I order something, it comes out wrong. Last week I asked for a Cheesy Gordita Crunch with no spicy ranch, a burrito supreme with no sour cream, the burrito came out right but the Gordita had that awful sauce on it. It took the woman taking my order about 4 minutes to figure out how to put it in, which ok they had a new system so I'll cut them some slack but still. Today I went and ordered a single Double Chalupa, 10 minutes later I went back up and they said "they're making it now"...seriously? A one item order and they wait till someone is basically out the door to make it. The best part when I said "don't worry about making it just give me my money back" they looked like I just asked them the mathematical formula for calculating the speed of light. I'm happy y'all get $11 bucks an hour now but seriously try to not suck at your job.

Very disappointed! I normally don't write reviews but felt compelled.  After taking forever to take our order and to cook the meal, our food came.  I took a bite of my Berry Salad which was actually a salad with bacon and blue cheese.  I don't like blue cheese. So I started eating the salmon on top which was so hot it burned the roof of my mouth.  It still hurts! We were able to flag down the waiter, who apologized.  I asked for just the Berry Salad without the salmon and he brought it.  The salmon was good once it cooled down.  Other restaurants would take the meal off the bill or offer a free dessert but not the Burntwood Tavern.  An order of pretzel bread also came out terribly hot.  More like burnt mouth than Burntwood.

DO NOT lease here. Worst apartment complex to lease at. They have very unprofessional people working at the office. The complex is right next to a sketchy trailer park whose residents jump over the wall and steal belongings off the properties. The management does NOTHING to properly secure the area (security, cameras, etc.) The shape and condition of the apartments are crap. You can hear every footstep of the person walking above you. They charge for unnecessary maintenance that is clearly their fault. Very mediocre and old appliances put in.

Yelp Says that Two Starts = Meh. I've experienced better.

Here is how Ceasars Palace got two stars from me:
* STAR 1 - Saw it in almost 24 yo movie called "Rainman"
* STAR 2 - Saw it in Hangover

It would have gotten 3 more starts if:
* STAR 3 - Coffee and pastries in downstairs coffee shop were each $3 less and tasted better than hot bitter liquid and old newspapery food
* STAR 4 - They cut their prices in half and doubled the quality of their rooms
* STAR 5 - I had no other options

When I was a kid, this place was amazing...but even back then, I would have taken a Motel 6 and a happy meal toy over staying at Ceasars Palace.

My Aunty and Uncle have been visiting the Cal with Vacations Hawai'i for a few years and always had good experiences there. On their recent trip, Uncle had a medical emergency and fainted while standing in line for the buffet. As my Aunty was calling for help, a nice man standing behind them caught my Uncle to stop him from falling and security immediately came to help him sit down and called for an ambulance. The security even provides transportation to and from the hospital.  Everyone there was very patient, kind and concerned.  You could really feel the Aloha spirit there!

I stopped into this location for a quick lunch today.  Restaurant was pretty busy.    Upon arriving at 12:35 Pm the tables that were not taken with people sitting at them had dirty dishes on them.  After I ordered and went to sit down I asked the cashier if she could wipe the table, she didn't come over so I just put the dirty dish from the table on the counter next to the register.  I had a salad bar salad and piece of pizza.  By the time I was finished lunch at 12:55 NONE of the tables had been bussed or cleaned and my plate was still sitting by the register untouched.  I was very disappointed in the atmosphere not being clean and only can think about if your dining area is that dirty how dirty is your kitchen?

They created centerpieces for all my tables and did a wonderful large balloon arch in the entry to the room.  Brenda is responsive and cares about her business and I highly recommend her and Balloon Happy AZ for any affair.

Our family was forced into car shopping as our previous Volkswagon was totaled in a car accident.  After calling around the Valley to get prices, I placed a call to North Scottsdale VW. Spoke with Nate and he promptly told me he would match the price I was given elsewhere.  When I got to the dealership he put me in touch with David Bonanno to finish the transaction.  I can not say enough wonderful things about Dave and the experience we had at this dealership.  No game playing, straight talk and reliable information.  They do what they say.  Dave went over all the details clearly and made sure we were comfortable with every step.  We purchased the first car, then a few days later decided our family needs the 100% safety of being in a VW, so we traded in our other cars and rounded out the family in Jetta's.  Our family motto is Volkswagon's for the win and Dave Bonanno is OUR GUY.  Thanks Dave, keep up the good work.

I have used Mike for many rental property renovations over the last 2 years.  He has not only renovated these properties but took over as property manager.  Mike inspects the properties before I buy them to ensure that the project fits into my "portfolio".  A friend & brother (based on my referral) also use his expertise for their properties.  Mike treats our properties as if they are his own, and is very good with the tenants.  Tenant service calls are handled in a timely manner.  Mike communicates with me almost daily with updates.  His repair and property management rates are reasonable as compared to the competition and he is honest & trustworthy.  I would not hesitate to recommend Mike and I plan to use his services for years to come.

Had dinner here and nothing really special compared to Louisiana buffets.  King crab and snow crab are on the menu but they are served cold and almost frozen.  Louisiana casino buffets actually steam their crabs which I believe taste better.  Everything else on the buffet was just nasty or below standards in taste.  If it wasn't for the crabs, I'd give this place a 1 star.

Seems like all Vegas buffets suffer from the same disease, they are large in square footage but small in selections and high in price.  They are built for flash.

We stumbled upon this place when the brewery we came for was completely packed. What a great find! The menu is mostly sandwiches, but they have a large variety and a lot of interesting options. I had the Philly cheesesteak and it was one of the best I had ever had. They put their house-made beer cheese on it and it was just amazing. The fries were great too. Good beer selection and lots of TVs with different sports events on. Service was a little slow, but good other than that (and in fairness to them, it was pretty busy). I recommend a visit if you're in that part of Charlotte!

This review has everything to do with business practices and bait and switch advertising - Do not believe any advertised deals this course posts -  I tried to redeem an ad sent via a short code text and when I attempt to redeem the club house states it is for clark county residents.  It's not like I sneak myself onto their database!!!  if you are operating multiple databases track your blasts and stand behind your mistakes, While the course is beautiful, the business practices make it one of the worst muni tracks you can think of.

I love this course - If you are looking for a lush country club type course then this is not your track - this is a true links course just like you find in Scotland - it is not lush but the greens are wonderful and the holes play similar to the British Rotation holes they pay homage to.  The bunkers are brutal and you will have to come out sideways.  

If you like challenges and want to think your around the course then please enjoy.  Also having marshal's that are pace of play demons makes the experience good for everyone - pace of play is for the people behind you.  I fully support their attitude and would appreciate it if more courses took the same approach!!!!!

Our steak burrito was soupy and couldn't finish it because it tasted so bad. The chicken tacos were very small and the shells were very hard. The chicken was dry and no flavor. We were charged an extra 50 cents for using a card which is fine, if we were told about the extra charge. We gave two stars because the man behind the register was nice otherwise we would have given one star. We will not return.

One of the most perfect, small, family run Mexican food places that I ever encountered. Atmosphere was authentic, the place is clean and the food is great. Not upscale by no means.
I had a Huaracha for the first time, and I loved it; it is loaded with good ingredients (including a cactus, which I had for the first time and it was great).
I stumbled upon the place following a Yelp recommendation, and was shocked at first how tiny the place is, but you discover there is more to it later. Although, try to sit at the bar if you can (if you like it), for a feeling different from other usual Mexican joints.

I also ordered the soup of the day - Clam chowder and it was absolutely superb. You cannot do better for Italian food anywhere. Sorry, does not get any better than here.

The Hi Life is a great glass shop.  In town from California I broke my quartz nail.  No problem though Ace and the rest of the staff were quick to help.  Not only did I get what I needed, I got some stuff I wanted.  There collection of name brand, one off, not mass produced glass is very impressive.  Also as a General in the G Pen army it was great to see fully stocked Grenco accessories, batteries, and full starter kits.  If you're in the area and you are in need of a vital piece that just broke or you just want to check out some truly impressive glass I'd get your ass in here.  Also walk around ask questions and talk shop, they'll hook it up if you're not a dick.

I had read a couple negative reviews before going for dinner last Tuesday night, so I was pleasantly surprised with my experience.

The menu is great - quite a bit of variety, and some interesting items. I had the "All Canadian Burger" with fries. The portion was huge. I actually had to cut the burger in half, as to not have it make a big mess - this is a good thing. Admittedly, it was a tad greasy, and was lacking a bit of flavour, I thought, but it was overall a decent burger. 

The service was fine. We had a very friendly server, who checked up on us periodically, and continued to refill our water long after the meal - no pressure to leave. It wasn't very busy, so perhaps we had better service as a result, but either way my experience was good.

Beer wasn't as over-priced as I expected - $6 for a pint of Heineken. 

I might check this place out again, to try some of the odder stuff on the menu. The only annoyance from the evening was that they didn't take Interac/Debit, but there was an ATM (with $2.50 fee) in the connected Thompson Hotel.

After reading the reviews on Yelp about this location, I was a bit skeptical, but checked it out anyway... I'm glad the lower rating didn't scare me off, 'cause this was one of the best thin-crusted pizzas I've ever had!

I'm fairly new to the thin-crust pizza scene, and this place really didn't do it for me.

A friend told me about this place, so I checked it out with a couple buddies last Friday evening. After an hour waiting for a table (expected, considering we just walked in at 7pm on a Friday), our server ran down the specials, and pretty much the whole menu. Very friendly, though a bit tough to hear in the smaller, crowded environment. 

I went for the Salami pizza, which arrived at the table quicker than expected. Unfortunately, I was not pleased with how quickly the thin crust can get soggy upon saucing and piling on toppings. This point alone dropped my rating to 3 stars. I've heard mixed reviews about the crust, but my buddies and I all agreed that it was just way to soggy for us. 

I did, however, find a fix for the soggy pizza - take some home in a doggybag, reheat in the oven, and it's the delicious taste of the pizza, with a better crust.

I doubt I'll return to this Pizzeria - next to try is Terroni's.

I went here last week with a group of 7-8 people, and I was pretty impressed. To be honest, this was my first true Japanese cuisine experience, aside from the occasional sushi place.

We got a one bedroom suite for myself and our 2 boys and the room was great and the price was right (best rate was found on BookIt.com).  The first rate we found Trump matched when I called them directly, but they would not match this one so I had to cancel my direct reservation and make it through the third party.  Full Kitchen (which you get with the one bedrooms) was GREAT.  Saved lots of money on meals.  Master Bathroom was huge!  Would have been five stars except that the pull-out couch was so soft and springy that even my 40 lbs kids complained about it.  They did have housekeeping bring an extra thick blanket to put below the cover sheet when I called about this, to lesson the feel of the springs.  However, I do not think an adult could have slept on this.

So far it is a dud! The hostess was MIA for five minutes but we were finally seated. Jennifer, our server did finally show up as well.  
Waiting for the food. Hopefully will be a little quicker. Stay tuned
The coffee was good once it showed up. My wife's burger was nuked and went back. It was ok the second time. My chicken was very oily and the breast was dry.

The best part of the meal was the pretzels. Outstanding!

I would not return.

My uncle took me to this wonderful restaurant last week, promising me that it would be the best Thai food I'd ever had in Montreal.

C Thai Cuisine did not disappoint.

My first impressions of the restaurant were how clean it was inside and how kind and welcoming the owners were. They're in the first year of business and do all the work in there. But they take the time to talk to you and help you make your selections by suggesting menu items. There is a lot to choose from!

I started by ordering delicious summer rolls. This item is hard to mess up, and I admit that I've enjoy equally good rolls in other restaurants. My uncle had a won ton soup, his favourite. He's tasted enough won ton soup in his life to be able to confirm that it's delicious here.

I also had fried vegetarian dumplings, served with a delicious ginger-soy dipping sauce.

For my main course, I had roast duck with red curry, coconut milk, and basil leaves. I've never had duck at a restaurant before, and I was very please with my selection. My uncle had a pad Thai with shrimp and squid and he loved it.

The restaurant recently got its alcohol license, having a bring your own wine/beer policy. Icing on the cake.

If you like extraordinary Thai food and like to support hard-working entrepreneurs who actually serve a GREAT product, please go try C Thai Cuisine. You won't be disappointed.

Tehran is a wonderful establishment.

I've been an infrequent visitor for the past 10 years. I always wish I'd go more often.

The menu doesn't have too many options. But the choices you have are so flavourful that you won't feel lacking.

The plate sizes are quite large, though I have noticed that portions decreased a bit recently, and prices went up. Worry not, you'll still be stuffed and not spend too much.

Everyone should give Tehran a try. The food is delicious and the service is quick. And shame on someone rating a restaurant they've never been to and making a judgment based on hearsay.

Was there for the Browns pre-season game.  Cheap beer, good wings, and good crowd.  Props to the dude working the bar and covering half the tables.  Other 2 bartenders looked like they wanted to kill someone all night and avoided serving customers at bar.  Yes, it was busy, but you would have had great tips and customers staying longer if you had smiled once the entire night.

Not sure what all the hype is about. We had a friend in town and were excited to try a new restaurant. Everything was extremely bland - I thought this was an Indian restaurant? Drinks were underwhelming and 85% ice. The decor is tacky (although the ceiling is cool). There is this weird partition with holes in it, great for customers waiting for their tables to stare at you while you enjoy an intimate dinner! And then the bill came! Not only was it extremely overpriced, we had to wait forever to pay the server - by that time we really wanted out of there! Montreal is a city full of amazing restaurants - don't waste your time on this one!

As close as I have ever gotten to "authentic" Mexican food. I was expecting the same ol canned beans and flavored food, but it was almost as goods as my mother home cooking! Of course no one can ever beat moms haha. Hard to empress a Mexican with restaurant style food, but this place did it indeed! Will be back

We were in Pittsburgh for a special occasion and decided to try Meat and Potatoes. We had a reservation and we were seated right away. I loved the atmosphere. It was pleasantly full but not crowded. No tvs at the bar which made for a lovely ambience. Our reservation was for later in the evening so the restaurant seemed to clear out with the theatre crowd. Our waiter was great, attentive without being overbearing, knew the wine list backwards and forwards and was lovely. We got the fried chicken livers and Cobb salad and then the steak for two with a chocolate dessert. All of it tasted delicious - well seasoned and generous portions on the sides. The only very minor drawback is the two top tables are very close to each other and it feels a bit like you are dining with the couple next to you. I would definitely recommend to friends who visit Pittsburgh.

I wish there was a 1/2 star option but you know there isn't so I have to give it one. Where to begin... Our meals took almost an hour to come out on an average Thursday night. 
When the food finally comes out the server brings out my meal and says who got the cheeseburger with mustard...but the burger has no cheese and no mustard!!
One of the worst meal experiences I've ever had. I do not recommend it if it's important for you to get your food in a timely fashion, hot or prepared as you've specified. Lower your expectations or dine elsewhere.

In two words? Completely unethical. BUYER BEWARE if you are considering using Air-Force 1 Air Conditioning, LLC.  

They came recommended to us through our realtor when we were in escrow on our house.  The inspector recommended we have an air conditioning specialist evaluate the AC unit in our prospective house b/c it was not functioning within acceptable range when tested. 
Air-Force 1 claimed they inspected the unit, but very clearly, that was not the case. Post-inspection we REPEATEDLY tried to ascertain the inspection report they claim they completed, but they said 'it was lost due to moving [their] locations'. 
No more than 2 weeks after we closed escrow, the AC stopped working (In Arizona, in July!!) and we called our home warranty people to come and replace the unit.  They said it was very old and very damaged - so they denied our claim.

Remember that inspection report I said we were trying to obtain? Well, this is where it gets good.  They were never able to produce the original inspection document or the email they allegedly sent to my realtor stating that the unit had no issues. When we approached Air-Force 1 regarding the broken AC, they fabricated a duplicate report that 'back-peddled ' all the initial information they said about the AC unit being fine and stated that there were issues (mind you, only after speaking to us to find out what had gone wrong with the unit).

In the end, we got screwed for almost $4K on a new AC unit because apparently it was beneath Air-Force 1 do perform their job correctly or with integrity.

I will be sure to post my thoughts on this matter on 'pissed consumer' as well as to all 1,087 of my Facebook friends, not to mention the 12,000 people who follow me on Twitter.

Thanks for listening!!

My husband & I made reservations for two for an anniversary. When we got to the restaurant they told us the restaurant was sold out to a Xmas party and proceeded to walk us out to their pizza place. They put us at a table in the middle of the doorway. I could not get into my seat it was so tight. I tried to pull the table out . That put my husband way in the middle of the doorway. They did have an open table for 4 but would not make it available to us. We just left the place. Ruined our evening!!!!!!

I was treated like trash by Kristine ???? a sales woman when I went to return a Nespresso Milk Frother that I bought at the Biltmore store. It stopped working. I had the receipt, the original box and even the original William Sonoma bag. When she found out I needed to return something she said "you'll have to wait." She went to a computer and did stuff and even made a phone call.  She kept saying "I have one and my daughters have one and they work perfect for years." I finally got store credit. Don't go there. You will get better service at Wallmart !!!!!

I'd heard about the store before but had never really been in. I was NOT disappointed! I received excellent service from Cherie (I'm sure I spelled it wrong)! I walked in. She greeted me and asked if I was shopping for a specific event. I told her I was and she immediately asked my size and put some options in a fitting room for me. It was great to have her suggestions and I walked out with two dresses she picked. Best service I've had in a clothing store probably ever. I will definitely be back!

Went tonight on a recommendation and was horribly disappointed. We often go to Genghis Grill and love it so we wanted to try this. This doesn't even come close. The meats looked like frozen, rolled up lunch meat. Veggies looked ok. Wasn't really any taste to the bowl unless you drenched it in teriyaki and soy sauce. My man didn't even finish his food and that never happens. Even the frozen yogurt didn't taste very good. They have toppings for 25 cents each from a gumball dispenser. We definitely won't be coming back. We'll stick to Genghis Grill.

ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH THE TIME! I wasn't "Allowed" to see all of their dresses. The "show room" was shitty AF! Renovation is a MUST! Add natural lighting or white lights! I felt dirty after trying on the dusty sample dresses. Customer service is lackluster and passive aggressive AF! Waited 25 minutes to be seen! I would never give them my hard earned coin!

Had an AMAZING experience at Luv Bridal! I had just had a horrible experience at a different shop but my mood instantly changed when I walked in this place. They were so attentive and sweet. Beth, my consultant, was absolutely amazing. This shop is absolutely gorgeous and knows how to make a bride feel amazing. They have a great selection of beautiful dresses and the prices are so incredibly reasonable. I'm so glad I came to Luv Bridal. I found my absolute dream dress and Beth was just as excited for me as my family and I were. Couldn't have had a better experience and I would recommend this shop to anyone!

I've never been much of a reviewer but after going to Salon Surreal I didn't have a choice! I absolutely loved my time at this salon. I've never been the type to do a whole lot with my hair since its kind of a strange curl that's pretty thin. I made an appt with Nicole for a full color, hi-lites, and cut & style. I got there a little before my appt which was set for 11 and the salon was clean and absolutely adorable. Nicole came and introduced her self right at 11 and took her me to her station. She asked me what I wanted and I showed her a picture. My hair was previously dyed black and the picture was of a pretty honey brown with some hi-lites. She thoroughly explained why it really wouldn't be possible to do that color without damaging my hair and it possibly not even turning out well. She explained what might be a good alternative and I told her to go for it. She was conversational and made great conversation for the whole 3.5 hr appt. She ended up doing a full hi-lite with a toner and a cut. I absolutely LOVE how it turned out and have already received so many compliments on it. I also love the cut she did and she straightened it for me which is always a luxury since I don't do it myself. I walked out of the salon looking and feeling like a million bucks! I will definitely be going back frequently to see Nicole!

My service advisor was Justin. I purchased my Hyundai from Chapman Ford but when it started acting up I knew I wanted a Hyundai dealership to fix it. I'm so happy I went with Chapman Hyundai. I called to check my warranty status and they were able to fit me in with an appointment quickly. They needed to order a part for my car so they set me up with a rental while my car was fixed. The next day my car was fixed but I was at work til after the service shop closed. Justin set it up so I could pick up the car after hours. Pickup was seamless and I was greeted in my car by a cute ribbon tied box full of candy. Great, efficient service by this service shop

I give this place a 2 stars because the filet mignon sandwich was tender,but lacked flavor  that's it and I'm being generous, we sat at the bar stools with a friend for lunch and the bartender was quite rude and it was our 1 st time so we had some questions, it was Mother's Day so they were not serving the whole menu as they had a buffet, we asked the price of it and she ignored us, then there was a photocopy page with some food they served from the menu, again no price, I hate to get ripped off because happened to me every time I order from menus without prices, finally we got a regular menu to see what came with the food and stuff, I probably won't go back service is super high on my expectations and it sucked here.

We were pleasantly surprised with the sushi rolls , fresh salmon and dragon roll were great so was the tempura appetizer was a great deal, my daughter had a side of fried noodles with chicken she loved it! I have one complain about the green tea, it was so weak and came from a tea bag, expected more at a Japanese place. The sesame chicken is not your average it's tonkatsu chicken with the sauce on the side, I happened to like it, not so great the tonkatsu sandwich my hubby was dissapointed with it. The ginger salad dressing was way to strong like pure ginger blended but the sesame dressing was delicious!! They really need to get bigger tablecloths or none at all, they were wrinkled and didn't cover the whole table, uncomfortable too. The service was ok , will love to see the host smile at least once :) overall we liked the sushi and will probably do to go next time instead on eating in !

We were on the mood for Greek and decided to try this place even the outside and the ambiance is soo outdated, always looks closed from outside. The food was ok, not great the Greek salad was not impressive it didn't even have onions the chicken was tasty, the meat kebab was dry and unseasoned but the worst part was the service, we where there at 7 and they close at 9:30 pm but as soon as we got our meals, we where not even half way into the meal they asked us its everything ok? Do you need anything? We said we are great thanks so they gave us the check???? What ??? There was definitely not a line waiting at the door , we were 2 tables on Saturday nite and didn't offer dessert or coffee we love baklava but not, we just got the check. Paid left and won't be back!!!

We wanted to try this place for a while and finally made it, mm not so amazing as the reviews I have read , may be I'm a Japanese food snob because its in my blood ha, but I though it was just ok, not impressed by sushi, Korean food was good we had the triple grill and it was the best deal in the menu I also think the size of the Mix tempura was soo tiny, one little broccoli , one slice of zucchini , 2 small sweet potato and 3 shrimp, why not just give al least 2 of each so 2 can share??? Service was just ok, one server was alone and no one helping her , it was a week day and there where at least 5 tables, I was thirsty half of the time I was there , asked 3 times and finally got a drink :/ I feel bad for her but I needed a drink!!! Haha hope you all have a better experience!!

I was so disappointed after reading reviews.  We ordered a gyro wich was good but the french fries were super soggy and oily.  The salad was so slappy cut huge and had 3 little squares of feta cheese then the grilled chicken I added to it was gummy like they microwaved after was grilled and sitting there. It was pretty gross dry and chewy.

This place has the potential for 5 stars but not as is today!!! We live 5 min away and after reading the reviews we were soo exited to try a place where we could became regulars, we walked in and the place looks super cozy and nice , here is one star!! The music was amazing , there was live music and was really great!!! That is my other star!!! The service was the worst I had n a long time, the waitress was careless , never checked on us, plates were Piling on our table, my husband got a bacon cheese burger, she forgot the bacon and didn't even said sorry, the burger was aww , nothing great , we had fried calamari , was blend and we didn't even get a wedge of lemon they advertised is served with on the menu!! But it was so hard to get attention from the waitress we were done before she came back. I had the chicken Parmesan , and for what I read on the other reviews I was expecting it to be good, pasta was overcooked , chicken was soggy and took me 10 min to get the waitress to bring me Parmesan cheese, and when she did she slammed it on the table like she was angry she had to go grate it or something!!! And last of all, the garlic knots sucked!!!! They brought 4 out for a table of 3 and they where ok, a little heavy but fresh, we asked for some more and I think they were from the day before reheated, it was steal . Well all I have to said is I won't be a regular here, and they need some management checking on the staff because service was terrible!!!

I just chaired a fundraising event for a wonderful Scottsdale charity, Foothills Animal Rescue and it was our first "gala" at our new headquarters.  I found Classic Catering on the web and looked up their reviews on YELP, which were all excellent.  After talking with Joe on the phone, I felt confident that I had found the perfect caterer ! He immediately offered to come out to our center with his daughter Denise to discuss the layout and finalize the menu.  He was the only caterer I spoke with , to offer that!
This past Saturday was the event , and it was fantastic! Denise, Joe Jr, and their team did an amazing job! The set ups were gorgeous, with flowers and color coordinated linens and beautifully presented food. Our guests raved to me about the quality and selection of foods and the beautiful dessert table.  Their staff were hard working , friendly professionals, that engaged with the guests in a lovely manner.  I can't recommend them enough and am delighted to know that we have found our "go to" caterer for our events. Thanks Joe, Miley, Denise, Joe Jr and your awesome team!!

Rachel recently assisted my husband and I with our home purchase in the cleveland area. She was great at the knowing the area as we had just moved to ohio. 

Rachel was great throughout the offer process which for us was a little lengthy and had some hiccups. She offered us solutions and options during stressful times and was spot on with communication. She was always on time and was very easy to get ahold of. I would certainly recommend her for your home buying/selling needs!

She also an amazing person just to have adult interaction with when you are a stay at home mom and craving social interaction!! My son loves Lisa, he would fall asleep upon her arrival almost every time. I would highly recommend post partum doula services from Lisa and her team for first time parents or any mothers that are worried about post partum life.

She referred me to chiropractors and other professionals that could also help with our latch issues.

I like the fact that his lunch menu isn't too busy with a lot of different selections. The service was awesome. My only gripe would be it took, for me a little to long to bring out my husband and I starter. But I say it still deserves 5stars.

I ordered 20 wheel studs. They ordered 19 which did me no good at all. I had to make a second trip. When I complained the young manager appeared upset and ask me if I wanted the lugs or not. I took the studs. They were the wrong size. This is the worst service I have ever received. Not because they made a mistake. But because they do not care if they did. The manager should be fired. But of course their main office will not respond. So go somewhere else   They do not hold themselves accountable for their actions. Just in case advance auto sees this my name is David McNair. I am in your system. No excuses.

Meh

You know, this resto club used to have great food, which came from the AIX kitchen, downstairs. Now AIX is gone, and the food, when it eventually comes, looks better than it tastes, UNLESS you like really rich food. Like really rich. As in a thick white truffle cappuccino and a butter-like fois gras. The combination of tastes on the plate is...odd. I can understand, for example, the theory behind mixing the fatty salmon tartar with acidic apple, but, well, it doesn't work. The fois gras plate was equally challenged. The worst was their Christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert, which was essentially a stale Twinkie...

On the bright side, the decor and service was very good (apart from the slow, slow kitchen). In fact, this is one of the only restaurants I've been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates - very unusual.

I have eaten pizza here twice. It's good restaurant with fun decor. 

The food last night was decent, but I do think I could have made it at home with Jamie Oliver's Italian cook book. It's not too expensive, however, so long as you moderate your alcohol, which justifies going there. It can also be fun, with the nod to the retro decor and interesting hipster patrons an staff. Our hostess was great and the waitress not so good (didn't ask how things were until the meal was almost done, didn't ask me if I wanted another drink, etc.). 

The rustic style pizzas do remind me more of true Italian pizza than one would normally expect of a North American pizza joint. The name Magpie, after the bird, is a very commonwealth reference, which may seem odd at first. It is, however, one of a number of restaurants with British references that have opened in the past year or so in Montreal: e.g. Sparrow, Lawrence, Brit & Chips, the Burgundy Lion, etc. 

All in all, I will go back, but with moderate expectations.

On a visit to Scottsdale, AZ I trusted yelp to search for a savory ice cream parlor. Yelp has not let me down! 

Upon reading all the reviews on yelp and how great sweet republic was, my family and I decided to try it. The Toffee Bonafi was a party in my mouth, literally! The combination of vanilla, toffee brittle, and salted caramel was a great way to end my night. My daughter got the strawberry sherbet and the taste was bursting with strawberry flavor. You can tell that it was made from scratch and no where near compares to any store bought strawberry ice cream.

I wish they had this ice cream stop in California! If you are in the Scottsdale area, I would highly recommend stopping by for a cool sweet dessert!

Went and sat at two open seats at the bar. One of the managers came over after we ordered a drink and said "can't you obviously see these seats are taken". Very rude. We moved to a different seat at the bar. The bartenders apologized profusely and bought us a round of drinks. No one ended up sitting at these "reserved seats at the bar" so the bartenders moved us back. The bar staff was phenomenal. Manager was a complete tool. Let me know when you let him go and we'll be back for drinks.

Terrible service.  I brought in a suit jacket and pair of pants.  The pants came back more wrinkled than when I brought them in and they ruined my suit jacket.  It looks like they put the suit jacket in the washer and dryer and now it has permanent little wrinkles all over.  Employees didn't try to fix it and said it would have to wait for the owner and they didn't know when he would show up.  After a day of waiting I took everything to a new cleaner to salvage.

I would rather pay a little more to make sure my clothes come back in one piece.  Not worth it.

At the end she will answer any questions you have left, but she hit every single topic I wanted to cover so I didnt even have anything left to ask at the end lol.

My wife had the fish (MahiMahi) & shrimp and loved it. Both daughters had chicken, orange & lemon pepper, and were very happy with it. Very generous servings. Sides of crab rangoons, cabbage & sticky rice were all very good. Ordered the seafood soup w/crab, shrimp &scallops. That will have to wait for home...too full

My daughter purchased a Deep cleaning for my house since I have been very busy and tired lately. My husband just had open heart surgery 2 weeks ago and between the hospital, having him newly home and working I have not had the energy to clean much.  We have 3 Akita's so just keeping the hair up is enough for now, Sara came and was very up beat and we discussed what needed to be done.  She asked if I wanted anything else that she might have missed and I asked for the arcadia door to be washed down from the dog nose prints and dust.etc.  She did it right away and I definitely will be contacting them again for future work. I also will be asking for Sara!  She even organized my piles and put away our shoes etc. Fine work!!!

Excellent service! Came here after a horrible expierence with another car dealership earlier in the day. Brady was the only guy there with alot of customers in the office. He met us all in a timely manner and assisted with questions with ease and confidence. I never once felt as if he was too busy for me eventhough he had a pavked lot of people. I test drove two of his suv's he had on the lot and decided right then and there. He ran credit on me and bam we were rolling. Gave me different payment options and scenarios all while staying honest and even standing his ground a little when negotiations came:). I like that about him. It was fair. I got what i wanted at the payment i wanted. Period. No hassel no hidden anything very professional. He even stayed lateer than usual to make sure i was satisfied with my purchase being the night nefore valentines day needless to say his wife im sure wasnt happy about this..lol but he took the wifely lashing so to speak to make sure i was taken care of and happy. Being scared of car dealerships and salesmen..Brady is a glimpse into how my grand daddy use to say car deals went. U go in tell em what u want and they made it happen and u were happy.

Rude and very unprofessional... Where should i start? I went with a friend to see about a car they had listed on craigslist. I had spoken with "mike" over the phone the day before so upon arrival i felt comfortable. This soon changed. Mike comes out while looking at the car..no greeting nothing just a stare.. I inform him that i was the person he spoke with. He rudely asked me if i needed financing or would i be able to pay cash. That shouldve been the warning..he made us feel very uncomfortable and i told him this...he softened a bit so we continued..My intention was to pay cash for the vehicle at first but having little credit i decided to make a larger down payment and just do financing...this upset him. When we asked to take the car for a test drive we were told that we had to be approved for financing first...and that a test drive was out of the question... (Keep in mind the car was a 05 with 190,000 miles on it. Cash price 5900). Another buyer came in and asked about the same car. Mikes partner told him no problem let me get u plates for a test drive. Right in front of us... When we asked why they could test drive and we couldnt mike and his partner screamed at us and said verbatim: I DONT WANT TO DEAL WITH COMPLAINTS IM CALLING THE POLICE GET OUT OF MY OFFICE..shocked we asked for our paperwork back of which he gave us another buyer's app and dl copy...we left. Went to a car place right around the corner and were treated much better. Better deal same truck 60,000 less miles..lower down payment and monthly payments. Be ware of the false reviews.. These guys will treat u like dirt if u question anything they say. Shop around many car places over there. With nicer salesmen and lower miles

They were okay but nothing to rave about - especially the pastrami which was not as tasty as we expected. We are both from NYC and believe we know what good pastrami should taste like. Won't be back.

With great expectations I found Ka to be a bit of a disappointment as the show did not live up to my expectations. I give the show three stars:

First star is for the opening sequence. Just prior to the show the audience is treated to some acrobatic antics, and even a comedic reminder to stow the electronics. Paired with helpful staff in costume and character helping you to your seats, and a breathtaking stage to take in sets your heart pumping for a great show. The opening scenes don't disappoint. The martial arts in the first couple scenes are amazing to watch, and soon you are treated to a boat scene that is also fun to watch. 

Second star is for great acrobatics with the "death wheel" (you'll know it when you see it), and some more cool action sequences to close out the show. 

Third star is for the stage, which is a character all to itself. A massive monolithic stage that is on some sort of hydraulic mechanism that allows it to move, rotate, and lean in amazing angles further shows off the athleticism and skill of the actors as they use the stage to show a variety of talents. The stage can also be lowered completely out of site allowing for cool aerial acrobatics as well. 

Now for the last two stars that this show lacks. First off, you better listen carefully to the few lines of narration at the beginning of the show because that's all you'll get. While it does give the outline of the plot I still found it extremely difficult to follow the story line, and in fact there were several scenes that seemed ponderously slow and even repetitive without advancing the story in meaningful ways.  You never really understand why the enemy attacks, but they attack again and again, and normally in the same repetitive fashion. There are also two scenes, the beach and the shadow puppets, that are awkward and feel completely out of place. 

Second, with the exception of the first 10-15 mins and 5-10 mins towards the end, the show's acrobatics seemed to be just "OK". There were "wows" and "oohs" and "ahhs" in each section there, but often there were only a few and sometimes featured too early in a scene and repeated then without the same wow factor. With such an impressive stage and hints in the pre show antics of ways to use the stage and even the space above the audience in amazing fashion, the show itself left me with the sense that there was so much more that could've been. 

All in all I was entertained but I can't say I enjoyed it, especially in comparison to other Cirque du Soleil shows and expectations. It's worth seeing for the stage if you can get a good price, but be prepared to feel like you over invested 90 mins of time. In another city and without the CDS mystique it would probably be amazing and awe inspiring, but in a Las Vegas world where "Too Much" is often "Just enough", I felt like Ka was just a little lacking.

A complete Vegas experience. We arrived right at opening and we were seated immediately. The decor was very cool with comfortable chairs and variety from table to table. Our server, Christopher was fantastic, and he and his assistant, Mehdi, were both prompt, full of humor, and very attentive. 

Christopher had several recommendation but when my wife and I were both interested in the Fish and Chips, he suggested that we order one with their dessert add on special and share. We agreed and added a mixed green salad. 

The salad was big enough for three and was very tasty. The fish and chips were delicious, the beer batter very flavorful and the fish itself was cooked to perfection. More than enough again for two of us and we still had dessert to go. 

The sticky toffee pudding to close things out was amazing. Probably the best dessert we have ever tasted and again more than enough for two people to share. 

This is Las Vegas and everything was pricey but for the value of the food and the experience and the absolutely amazing service from Christopher and Mehdi, this was probably the best money we have spent so far on our trip. 

A fantastic experience and I highly recommend it.

The GM Nicola is fantastic he does a great job at giving the place great atmosphere with live music on the patio . So happy we finally found a bit of Italy right here in Henderson . The staff is mostly Italian and the dishes are delicious . We will be going back very soon . Thank you for the great evening . Grazie Rita

I will take all my fixes for my electronics to CJ. Lifesaver, especially because I didn't have to go through some outfit like BestBuy for the repair. CJ offered my some great tips as well to keep the system clean and what to watch out for. Thank you so much!!!

Thirteen of us ranging from 2 to 67 saw David Goldrake, and all of us loved the show.  Half price tickets told us it was the most family friendly show on the stip and they were right.

There are very few Caribbean restaurants that carry "Stew Peas" daily and are consistent with their portions. The staff are courteous and conscientious rather than rude and discouraging.  It may not be the fanciest but it's staff, meal choices and availability put it in a very select group.  Surrounding establishments carry similar menus, albeit you can only get certain items on special days.

A local establish that has a loyal following. No real bar for cocktails but ample beer selection. 

I was impressed with the servers knowledge and courtesy. It's hard to find great service and this is a four star service parlor. 

Two styles of crust. Thin or original. I would order original for take out because it holds up better. Thin crust is NYC style thin crust. 

This is not Papa Johns quality and the prices reflect the difference. Large cheese, large pep, sausage, onion and mushroom combined with a family size salad was 61.00. Not cheap but the quality is clearly different. 

Pizza was above Papa John's and below lombardi's. 

Salad dressing (house) was excellent. 

Overall, I would go again but wouldn't drive out of my way for the pie.

Here's the deal. This is a four star Mexican restaurant if the kitchen isn't jammed. I rated this three stars based on the food quality when busy. I love the polo fundido dish and the guac is above average. Pork stew and melted cheese apps are four to five stars. Go when it is slower and you will be happier.

After being bitter and insulted over being hit up for a cover charge on one Saturday evening I am adjusting my review. This is our local bar and I have had many great times as the service is always good and the food even better. I took my frustration out in a business that didn't deserve it. Great food and people . Not a fan of the new Saturday night Dj/cover but to each their own there is a place for everyone. My apologies for my anonymous poor review this is a way better place then I gave them credit for. Perhaps a breathalyzer on my yelp account would be helpful

What an amazing experience! The facility is very clean, the staff friendly and the prices so reasonable. 

I was in town and came in to see my old hairstylist from New York City, Laura. She's AMAZING! I travel a lot in the area for work and try to stop in town whenever I can. She immediately puts you at ease with her warm demeanor and is just so passionate and skilled at her job. She knows what I want without my really having to say it and goes above and beyond to make sure I am happy with my hair. She's very patient, kind and understanding - will keep following her wherever she goes! Great experience!!

Also, there is a really cute coffee shop next door called Lola's - their iced coffee is great!!

This place is amazing! I went here for the first time because I read great reviews and it was fairly close to my house. There are so many different types of burgers that you won't be able to find anywhere else because of their unique combinations. I had the Highway Man and it was stacked so high I could barely finish it. I also had their root beer float because I was craving it :)

Service was also very helpful. I didin't see the special burgers on the menu or what each one had, and the server took the time to explain each one to me. Very friendly.

Overall, it was an amazing experience and I'll definitely be back again.

My first time trying chiu chow food was at this restaurant. It's close to home and convenient for me.

I found the food to be delicious and had this recommended to me by family friends. I got take out last time, but I'll probably try dine in next time.

BTW, I've been to Dynasty Cuisine in the Markham region and their set meals were amazing. I found this deal on HungryBuy.com:

I usually get the Eel Fried Rice and the Crab Salad...can't remember if those are the exact dish names.

Dynasty Cuisine at Commerce Gate is pretty good too. I found a deal on HungryBuy.com for a full meal. Check it out.

Made an appointment for my 16 year old daughter to get a manicure. While there she asked to get her toenails painted black for a dance. The lady asked her if she wanted a pedicure she said I just want my nails painted black! They took her to the chair and put her feet in water. The lady asked her if she wanted her heels scrubbed she said no, just my nails painted black. So all said and done, they put her feet in water and put lotion on her legs and charged her $22 for a pedicure instead of $7 for a paint! I complained and he said she got a pedicure, I repeated that she only asked for her nails to be painted and he said that could mean many things not that she didn't want a pedicure and that Im just mad my daughter spent more money. I said he took advantage of a teenage girl and he said I should know better then to send my teenager there alone!!! Refused to give my money back! I will never go there again and will make sure everyone I know never goes there!! TERRIBLE WAY TO TREAT A CUSTOMER!!! And they fully took advantage of a young girl!! Would not recommend this place to anyone!

WOW just got done reading more reviews and I'm not the only one they took advantage of!! Seems to be a pattern! Wonder how many more people have been effected and just not taken to yelp! I have NEVER made a yelp review before, but did as soon as I got home from talking to Thang, THE OWNER no less!!

HORRIBLE dining experience tonigt!! Service was terrible, slow and unfriendly. Customers who came in after us by at least 30 min were served food before we were ( both of us ordered pizza ).  Dirty tables not bussed until customers came in and needed to be seated. Heard a customer be told there were no more clean plates... Finally after an hour and a half our bruschetta came out, but the crust was burnt terribly and they tried to cover it up with extra tomatoes. When asked if our pizza was coming soon, was told it had not been started yet!!! Told the server to cancel it and she brought us a check for our drinks!!! Paid cash for our drinks, which should have been comped in my opinion, the server told me they had no change!!  She then had to get me change from her purse. Watched 2 other tables walk out after us! Will NEVER go back!!

It came out very hot and fresh, the owner and sweet cook in the back couldn't be nicer!  Not really situated for larger parties, there were four of us and we ate outside as it seemed easiest with the small tables.  They specialize in take out and delivery.  

I wish we lived here and could visit all the time!

This is a review for Jen, the massage therapist located at Bio-Mechanics Las Vegas.  She has a great touch and a wonderful technique.  She is knowledgeable about body function and mobility and worked extra on the areas of my body that have been restricted and causing problems.  She also used a few awesome and interesting tools like silicone cups for a different type of skin rolling experience.  The pressure was perfect and I woke up this morning a little sore but can feel that the session was greatly beneficial!  Thank you Jen!

I'm only giving this place 2 stars because the vegan ice cream taste deserves 5 stars.  I was incredibly upset that the lady behind the counter spoke zero, yes, zero English.  I even pointed to the item I wanted on the large chalkboard on the wall (a vegan milkshake) and she said milk tea?  I was like, "No, a vegan chocolate milkshake" about 6 times I tried, to no avail.  Walked out with a scoop of vegan chocolate, which I somehow felt grateful to get.  Ice cream is incredible but will never return to this location.  Will only go to Jones & Warm Springs location or S. Ft. Apache.  Shame.

My carpets hadn't been cleaned in the 5 years we've lived in our house (we always take our shoes off before going upstairs) but they were just so pale and icky that I finally gave in.  Was referred by a friend and SO GLAD I was!  Our carpets look incredible and feel fluffy and amazing.  I literally just wanted to walk around upstairs all day the next day because it was so nice on my feet.  The price was reasonable too and though he was very thorough, it took only about an hour for my entire upstairs and stairs.  

I wish phone communication was just a little more clear with maybe a confirmation for our appointment as well would have made me feel better.  There was a scheduling issue but he made it later in the day.  We are very happy with the service!  :)

Delicious food!  I normally get take out as I live right down the street and it is always done within 10-15 mins, like they say.  I've dined in about 4 times and each time it was pretty slow inside but unlike the other reviewers, we had very quick service.  Actually, my entree came out while I was still eating appetizer & soup so I was kind of sad.  lol.  

I LOVE the decor.  It's not over the top, pretending like we're actually IN Thailand, but it's dark & sensual & usually very quiet, a great place to take a date.  The staff is super friendly and actually speak English too!  

I am vegan (no meat, no egg, no dairy) and I order all kinds of special dishes and they never mess it up.  My favorite dishes there are Pan Fried Glass Noodles, Galanga noodle curry & Pad Si Ew.  The sticky rice is AMAZING too!!!  LOVE GALANGA THAI!!!  :)

Closing 2 hours early with no post on the door for any explanation is completely unprofessional.  Even if you just said, "Slow night, sorry for any inconvenience" since we drove all the way across town to go here.  Very inconsistent when it comes to the desserts and the food is definitely not worth it.  When the desserts are good, they're really good (even if they have questionable ingredients), but SO often the $7 cakes are dry.  Very frustrated with this place.

The service here was the worst I've EVER experienced in Las Vegas (lived here 5 yrs now).  Not only did we end up waiting a total of about an hour before we got our food, but people that sat down after we ordered got their salads first.  I had all you can eat pasta (Tues night) $7 but they make you buy a $3 drink and I got a salad w/ it but my husband bought the gnocchi dish for $11 and didn't get a salad?  Dumb.  They also charged my husband $1 for adding a couple of shreds of basil to his dish.  My all you can eat plate came out and it was twice the size of his $12 dish and he couldn't get more.  It was terrible!  I had the carbonara sauce and it was okay but super buttery.  

FYI for the vegetarians, all sides are $3, yes, to add spinach to your dish is the same price as adding chicken.

We live right down the street and will not go again.

OK, first, my husband & I are vegan and are SO GRATEFUL to have this place to just "go out" and get ice cream.  Yes, it's expensive, but sometimes it's better to pay for health (and smaller portions) rather than go to Whole Foods & pay $5 for a pint of Almond Dream ice cream.  I agree, the flavors & sweetness can be mild, especially compared to all the processed crap w/ crap loads of preservatives that everyone is used to eating, but fact is, they will make it however you want...if you like strong flavors ASK for more/stronger flavor when you order it, I always ask for extra sugar in mine and it comes out just perfect.  I get Brownie Bits (brownies are vegan & gluten free & amazing!!!) w/ peanut butter ice cream & their waffle cones are out of this world!  Rochelle & Ginger are super nice & run a great shop.  Thank you for the opportunity to pick up a treat while I'm out shopping!  Oh, and they do have reusable sheets now that you just dry erase marker your selections.  They are environmentally friendly too w/ compostable spoons & bowls made of potatoes & corn.  :)  LOVE IT!

I used to frequent this place when it was in Scottsdale.  I loved this place! So on mothers day I decided to try out the new location via carryout. I called twice and got hung up on twice. I called back a third time to raise a complaint with the manager about the host Danielle ( who clearly doesn't want to do her job). The manager stuck up for Danielle saying that she was a sweet girl and that she would never do that. In the process pretty much telling me he doesn't care about our business. He could not have cared less and took no ownership. It'll be a while if ever I go back here.

I waited in line for 10 minutes (I was the only one in line) and no one greeted me and/or told me they would be with me. This place was a little busy but not overly and I could very clearly see employees just meandering throughout the garage. After I waited for a while with no acknowledgement I went next door to big o tires and got greeted straight away.

Excellent Mediterranean style food, nice ambience, cool artwork on the walls, friendly staff -- I hope they can keep up the high standards.

We were a party of 5 and went rather late on Sat. night.  We got great service and enjoyed the reverse happy hour specials (try both shrimp items...) along with a range of pita sandwiches, a salad and the shrimp skewers.

The one item that could have been better was the mushroom pita, which was rather soggy.

This is our go to restaurant for all you can eat sushi when we are in Vegas, and even if we're just passing through town. The variety of sushi available will satisfy just about anyone's taste buds and appetite. Our absolute favorite is the seafood salad, though. The medley of seafood and spicy seaweed will keep you coming back for more.

Having had Chinese food in India while growing up, we went with a lot of anticipation. Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.

The Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.

We wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.

The service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.

Our receipt invited us to share our experience at a "Talk2us" link, which only produced a "survey error."

Having had great Indo-Chinese food in Calcutta, Vancouver and Houston, we are still waiting for a comparable experience in the Phoenix area.

Gave this 5 stars, but it's NOT fancy or upscale at all, just so you know that. What it is: Excellent food (see the other reviews), service (very pleasant & attentive, desire to please), & an excellent Value! 

I had chicken taco's and my gal's beef (marinated) taco's were even better. (Soft tortilla's were hand made (they said) as ist all the food. Rice and beans were good (which for me means not fancied up or spicy). The Salsa was amazing!!! I always said you could make millions if you could get the roasted tomatoes and chili flavors w/o the burn/pain (I'm sure you can ask for the hot stuff if desired). Well they did it.   Margaritas were excellent (unfrozen w/ salt) Owners were most gracious named ,"Beth and Bill" (not the radio personalities). 

Very relaxed atmosphere (jeans are great as goes for all of cave creek) w/ a few small TVs around over on the bar side at least (no sound heard, which I preferred). 

Mariachis (probably just because it was Valentines) were a nice touch for the occasion, ... bit louder then I prefer, but they were very good and had the tact to not come over to our table since we didn't make eye contact. Nice voices and instrumentation to be sure. 

Handi-capped friendly from what I remember. Private parking on the side was pleanty for a fairly busy Sat. night (w/ more out back). Light gravel made for no dust, and wasn't too thick so I'd guess wheel chairs wouldn't be a problem. 

Not sure about reservations as we stopped on a whim, but with immediate seating on Valentines, I'd estimate no problems getting in,..least till the mobs at El Encanto find out about this place. :-) 

Am looking forward to one of their breakfasts.!
(would have probably gone with 4.5 stars if able.)

Excellent experience with these guys.  Chris, Mike and Russ were all very professional!   We hired the game bus for my son's 9th birthday. They came early early to set up and were ready to go before scheduled time.  The bus was a huge hit and really kept the kiddos entertained!  Would definately recommend Epic!

You won't find worse customer service only followed by full retail prices!  No greeting or acknowledgement.  We had to hunt down the teenage salesboy who was completely put out by our request for different size shoes.   Go anywhere but here. Sports Authority,  Sports Chalet. ..anywhere.  My experience is that the competitors actually want your business... unlike Dicks (fitting name)!!!

Best new car shopping experience!   No creepy high pressure sales. Employees are friendly and helpful!   On top of it, I feel like I got a great deal on a CX5, which I am loving!   I worked with Sergio on sales and Bridgette on finance. They were both awesome. Highly recommend this dealership.   
On a side note,  we stopped by Berge Mazda first.  I apparently parked my car in the wrong spot and got some under the breath comment from the sales rep, who said he would send someone out to help me. We waited outside for 10 minutes....no one showed so we left and drove straight to Horne.   We were greeted by Sergio right away who couldn't have been more sweet or helpful. Definately made the right decision! 
Thanks again guys for the great experience!

Pros: Environment, waitress service
Not so con: Asian Chicken Sesame Salad
Cons: Not know their Wi-Fi password 

Is it a good restaurant for kids? No
Is it good choice for big groups? No
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No parking lot

Around 12:00pm after I found that the St Lawrence market does not open on Mondays, I started to find a good place to have lunch on Old Toronto and I discover the The Corner Place. When we arrived, we could sit on any place because the place was not crowded.

The service was friendly and nice and the salad did not take so much time to arrive. But, at least, for me, when I arrive at place where the Wi-Fi is available I like to have access. I tried all the variations provided by the waitress and none worked. On the end, she asked me to look for one of the customers and ask him how they connect. Very bad negative point for me.
Overall, the salad was okay. To be true, I prefer the Asian Chicken Sesame salad from Panera Bread. The dried noodle was very hard to eat and most of the salad components were cut in chunks instead of niece pieces to eat with a fork. What makes a mess while you are eating. Well... I did not get excited with the food this time. But I intend to come back here again next time that I visit Toronto, I notice other dishes on the menu that called my attention.

Pros: Private parking lot, burger, service
Cons: 

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it a good choice for big groups? Maybe

This is a past experience review. On Thanksgiving Day around 8:30PM, we did not have so much effort to find a place to leave our car there. The hostess was very friendly and nice and directed us to our table without any need for waiting. Obviously the restaurant was almost empty due to the holiday.
The dining room was huge and there is a sundae bar that we got very tempted to eat there after the dinner. The waitress was very nice and friendly and was always checking our table to see if we needed something more. Because we were craving for a burger, my wife and I decided to build our own burger.
Overall, the experience was fantastic! The burger was big and juice and not greasy and the fries were delicious too. This is the type of restaurant that I will have as a first option when I go back to the Pittsburgh, PA again.

Pros: Philly cheesesteak,fries
Cons: No private seats, no Wi-Fi

On Monday around 1:00PM, the food court was crowded, but the line to the restaurant was not big. We did not take so much time to ask for our lunch. The restaurant seems clean and not messy.
One big point for this restaurant was that we did not need to wait so much for our food to be ready. Something that happens a lot of times with the so called "fast-food" restaurants. Because the court was crowded, it was hard to find a seat for us. We needed to spend some time to find a seat. This time I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and fries.
Overall, the experience was nothing special. Not bad neither fantastic. Just the good feeling when you leave a "fast-food" restaurant that knows what they are doing. The fries were not greasy and the sub was tasteful. The next time that I go back to Canada if I want to have a quick and good food for sure I'll eat here again!

Pros: Rolls, live music
Not so con: Frango no Churrasco
Cons: Bacalhau, parking lot, waitress service, no free Wi-Fi

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No

On Thursday around 7:00pm, me and my wife went to the restaurant to have our dinner and we faced the first negative point, the parking lot. The parking lot was not enough to accommodate all the people to the restaurant because it is shared with other stores around. So, it was not hard, but it was easy to notice there was not enough space for everyone. At least, we did not need to wait so much time to sit.

The table was clean, but there was an old newspaper below my table and I noticed that the floor was not totally clean. On a first moment, I thought that the waitress service was nice, but after we placed the order, we got forgotten. My soda glass was empty for a long time and the waitress never comes back asking if I wanted more. But the rolls were delicious, unfortunately, what I cannot say about the Frango no Churrasco and the Bacalhau that me and my wife asked.

Overall, it was frustrating for asking the two items that were house specialties and eat a food with poor quality. The Bacalhau was under seasoned and burned plus the potatoes were blend too. My Frango no Churrasco, the chicken was almost very good, the rice and potatoes were almost cold. It seems that the food was released for a time and they forgot there. But the worst for me was having a bad Bacalhau on a Portuguese restaurant. It is a very bad sign. I don't plan to come back again to it and if you are looking for a Portuguese restaurant, I recommend looking for other. There are a plenty around the Greater Toronto Area.

Pros: Environment, Staff, Gelatos, Salads, Soups...
Cons: Not having a location in Buffalo, NY :)

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? No
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No parking lot

After a long drive to Toronto, ON. We saw this small place and beautiful very near of our hotel. It was around 7:10pm when we arrived and the place was empty. Maybe because it is Sunday night. But is an injustice, places like this deserves to be always crowded.

The service was very friendly and nice and the salads and soups did not take so much time to arrive.  Almost all the sits you can admire the park, because the restaurant windows are very huge.  My wife asked for a lentils soup and Cesar salad, I just asked for the Cesar salad.

Overall, the salad was fantastic and my wife loved the lentils soup too. After, I went for my main event of the night: the gelatos. Oh the gelatos! They are the best in North America that I had until now. The Ferrero Roche is the top one.  This is the kind of place that worth to leave a diet. Nice people and food. Congratulations to G for Gelato and Espresso Bar. You made my night happy today!

As a brazilian i did not like tis restaurant. This not near a good churrascaria like brasa or fogo de chao and the maitree was very mean with me and my friends. The sides are poor, not even a black beans was served. The waitress forgot our table many times. The music volume was too high, we asked to move our table because we were on the direction of the aound box and the meat was good. But not anything special and i did not try all of them because the people keep forgettin where we were sitted. The only thing good on this restaurant was the guys that cut the meat for me. If you expect to have a real churrascaria experience, do not go to this restaurant. Try the other brasilian restaurants on montreal.

Pros: Chocolate Chip Cookie, food delivery station
Cons: Asian Sesame Chicken Salad

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? Maybe

On Wednesday around 12pm, I went to the restaurant to get my food to go and have my lunch on another place. The place was crowded, but I noticed some free seats there. The cashier line was not so big and I did not take so much time to place my order.

After paid, I direct myself to the food delivery station and noticed something that I never noticed on the other restaurants on the USA side. They have a monitor that counts how much time each food is taking to be ready to go and the order changes color when it takes so much time. Nice thing. It incentives the staff to have always a better performance.

Overall, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious like always, but I did not like so much the salad. Different than on USA, I found big chunks of lettuces instead of in small pieces like the other restaurants. This is a negative point to me, because I expect always a good preparation for this food due to the complexity of it. But I am willing to give a new chance to the place.

Cons: None this time

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? Maybe

On Wednesday around 7:30pm, I went to the restaurant to get my food to go and have my dinner on another place. The cashier was very quick and nice to take my order and at this time there were no line to place my order there.

After paid, there is a place that you can sit to wait for your food to be ready. I waited more or less 15/20 minutes for everything to be done. While I was waiting, I was using the free Wi-Fi to check my e-mails and read the news.

Overall, the fries were dry but tasteful. They were not greased or unseasoned and the burger at a first sight seemed dry what is a bad sign most of the times. But I was wrong, even not juicy inside the burger was delicious. They found the right balance between juicy and dry. I liked this restaurant a lot and I'm looking forward to go back there again.

Pros: The Original Burger, Roast  1/2 Chicken, Waiter service, Wi-Fi
Cons: Host service

Parking space: Enough for all customers
Good for big groups: Maybe

On a Good Friday, around 9:00 PM, the restaurant was almost full. But when we arrived there the hostess did not offer a place to us to sit at a first moment, we need to look for her and ask to sit on a table. But even with this, I liked the restaurant.
The waiter service was a little slower than most of the other restaurants but he was a very nice and friendly person. He was always aware when my soda needed refill. The place seems a night point for the young people on the city and the music was played for a DJ and after for a band. What I can say, it was cool! I almost stand and went there to dance. This time, my wife and I asked for a The Original Burger and the Roast  1/2 Chicken. Both food presentations were very good and in a "young" way.
Overall, it was a very nice experience. There was no dried part of the chicken and the chicken gravy was to dying for. And oh my God, the food was very exciting. Something to change? Nothing. Congratulations West50, me and my wife had a very nice time on your place and left the restaurant with the feeling that I want to go back again many many many more times.

Pros: Cesar Salad, Malaysian Chicken Curry, Service, Free Wi-Fi
Cons: I did not found

Parking space: Enough for all customers
Good for big groups: Yes

On a Good Friday around 2:00 PM, the restaurant was almost empty probably because the city was empty too. Said that, we could select any place to sit and wait for our food. The place is very clean and the menu was not fancy enough and offers any kind of food for different levels of taste.
The waitress was a very nice and friendly person. She was always aware when my soda needs refill. The place is very clean and calm. It is a very nice place to have a business dinner or just a quiet place to eat. This time, my wife and I decided to eat a Cesar Salad with Chicken and a Malaysian Chicken Curry. Where both food presentations makes me wanting to eat them with the eyes.
Overall, it was a very nice experience. I never thought that a coconut flavored food could be so good. Just as a personal touch, the only thing that I could change is cutting the chicken in pieces instead of having the whole chicken breast there. But, is how I said, it is only a personal touch. It is not something that made my experience worst. I left the restaurant with the feeling that I want to back again many more times.

Cons: Not having a restaurant in Buffalo, not enough parking lot for everyone, No Wi-Fi

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? Yes

On Saturday around 4:00PM, the restaurant was not so full and we did not need to wait to sit. The mansion is impressive and they make a very good use of it. But this is not a place for people that has problem with stairs, because the restrooms are located on the 2nd floor.
The waitress was very nice and friendly. She was always aware when she needs to refill my soda glass. The rolls were fresh and hot, something rare to find on a restaurant. The place is good for big groups and quiet enough for a calm lunch or dinner. This time we decided to try the Chicken Oscar and the Rib Steak.
Overall, the experience was fantastic as always. I did never have a moment where I came to this location or other locations on Canada and did not like. The rib-eye was very juice and delicious. This is why every time I came here to Canada, I want to eat there every time.

Pros: Roasted Almond gelato
Cons: Service

Parking space: No private parking
Good for big groups: No

On Saturday around 2:00PM, the store was not so full. One of the negative points was not offering more places to sit there and enjoy the gelatos or sorbets. But my wife and I found two seats for us to sit together.
I can't deny. The ice cream was very good. I had he roasted almond gelato and I'm still thinking on it, even many hours after eating it. But the service was something frustrating because when I asked if they had another flavors, the woman told me that they had more at the other store, something that I found on the same day that was wrong, because the other store was only going to start serving gelatos or sorbets until next week.
Overall, the gelato was very good but the service was very bad. The worst part beyond going to the other store and not finding what I want, was asking for where it was the subway on the Spadina Avenue and the guy told me that was very near to go walking what was wrong and I made my pregnant wife walking a lot without a need for that. Next time, I would ask if you do not know, do not give wrong information to the people. Because of this, I have no desire to go back to this location anymore and I don't recommend it!

Pros: Cost, breakfast, front desk staff, internet, dog friendly, fast internet
Cons: Housekeep, garage passage to the hotel, not so many good options to eat near around

Is the private parking lot enough to accommodate all the guests? No

On April 2012, I reserved a room for 2 nights because I had some appointments to attend on Toronto. The room that I got was small but not bad. Even not having some good options to eat near around, the localization of it stills good. Because I the only time that I needed to use my car again, was only to leave the hotel. It was very accessible to get the public transportation from there to anywhere that I wanted to go.

The front desk service was friendly and nice and the breakfast offered much more options to eat that I am used to have from other hotels that I stayed on Toronto. Unfortunately, when we said to the housekeeper that we don't want our room cleaned she started to question us when we were planning to leave and that we need to notify the front desk for that. (Note: we were on the middle of our 2 nights stay) This point upset me a little.

Overall, with the exclusion of the housekeeper moment, I liked so much the hotel and I am planning to stay there again next time I visit Toronto. And if you are planning to go there too, my recommendation to you is: leave all the luggage on the hotel lobby. Because if you try to use the corridor that connects the garage to the hotel it is not an easy thing to do because the doors are heavy and maybe you need to go back to the garage sometimes to get everything.

Pros: Service
Cons: Cafe affogato, whole slow-roasted hazelnuts tumbled in Peruvian dark chocolate, not having ice cream or sorbets

Parking space: No private parking
Good for big groups: No

On Saturday around 6:00PM, the store was full and there were no place available. But my wife and I had luck and a group left the table and we found a place for us to sit.
The service was very nice and friendly. And even after having the knowledge that the ice cream or sorbets of this store were seasonal. I wanted to try the affogato and the slow-roasted hazelnuts tumbled in Peruvian dark chocolate. This is not a place for big groups, but it is a lovely place for spending a time enjoying a coffee.
Overall, it was an okay experience. After eating and drinking what I bought, I left with the feeling of consuming overpriced products. The coffee and the hazelnuts were not bad, but they were not special too. But I still want to go back to this store yet, because I want to try the Nocciola gelato so much.

Pros: Private parking lot, barbeque, buffet, hostess, service
Cons: Be in Pittsburgh and not in Buffalo

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? Yes

This is a past experience review. Around 7:30PM, the restaurant was not crowded and there were still available many sits there. The hostess was very friendly and nice and directed us to the table without any waiting time. The parking lot is shared with the other stores of the mall, but because it was night and most of the commerce around was closed, so we can say that was a "private" parking lot.
The dining room was an excite place, really remembering a churrascaria on Rio de Janeiro. It made me feel home sick (what is good). The waitress was very nice and friendly and was always checking our table to see if we needed something more. Because this is a Brazilian barbeque place, my wife and I went there looking to eat a rodizio.
Overall, the experience was fantastic! Because they know how to cut the meat on a Brazilian style and they offer Brazilian goodies to consume there too like Guarana or Brazilian coffee. After the dinner, I talked with the owners and found that they are Brazilians. So, if you are really looking for a place to have a real Brazilian barbeque experience around Pittsburgh, PA, this is the place. I'm still trying to find a good excuse to travel again to the city and eat there again!

We went to Farm and Craft last night for my birthday dinner, and it was the worst service we have ever had, from start to finish. The hostess ignored us, and we waited 8 minutes to be greeted by our server when we were sat. I ordered a beer, it took 10 minutes to get. We waited another 5 minutes to order, and the appetizer took 25 minutes to get, and the entrees came out a minute later. To be fair, the restaurant was very busy. But the service was terrible. We will not be back, which is a shame, because this used to be one of our favorite spots. I'm not sure what's going on with this place, it's gotten worse and worse. Do yourself a favor, and don't go here, unless you sit at the bar, and only come during the day. The dinner service is a train wreck.

Incredible food at a great price point. The only thing I found strange was the ordering and service aspect, it doesn't make a lot of sense to have it set up the way that it is. You order at the counter, get your own drinks unless you order alcoholic drinks, and get your own condiments and napkins. Why do I need a server, and why would I tip that person? Anyway, the food, drinks and ambiance are great. If they were to change the service format, I would give them 5 stars. Check this place out.

Very limited menu, which was disappointing. The appetizer was lack luster, as it was only melted cheese and oil, which came out burnt and very greasy. The tacos were decent, but lacked imagination. The sangria was very run of the mill, and the service was atrocious. I have to say, we were very disappointed. It's over priced, and the hostess spilled sauce all over us, and did not even have the decently to apologize. We will be taking our business to other options, and will never come back. Go to Blanco or any other Fox concept, the food, ambiance and service will blow you away.

I love this restaurant. It's wonderful on so many levels. The location is a beautiful drive that takes you through some lush green fields if you're driving from mason. It's a family owned restaurant where the recipes are mom and pop perfected over years of being in the business. So needless to say, crazy high nom factor. And the gentleman running the place is super friendly so you get to hear some nice stories and experiences from his life in the south and the Midwest...the lunch buffet and dinner both are a win. Fresh and authentic from scratch. Unbeatable taste!

I've worked in the Yonge and Bloor area for a long time.  Everything here is bland, expensive and/or too time consuming.

The Vine Leaf is an excellent alternative option.  For under 10 bucks including tax I always get an extremely delicious and filling meal. The chicken shawarma plate is my meal of choice, but it's all good really. It's fairly busy but the wait to get my food is always under a couple minutes and as you can see in the pictures there's a comfortable area to eat your food. Also it's worth noting they have great customer service.

At Vine Leaf I'm able to have a decent meal, for a decent price, all within my designated break time.  I come here once a week. 5 stars.

I live in the area, so I was excited when this place opened up last year.  Since then I've been here twice.  Once I ordered a burger with duck fat fries,  and once I had a the rabbit burger.  I had high hopes for the burger with duck fat fries.. but they were just okay. I didn't care so much for the rabbit burger, but I don't hold that against wild burger I was just trying something new. Both times I felt a little gouged on the price. On their website they have the details of their daily deals, most centering on having a pint with dinner. But i find it irritating that there are no prices for their regular menu.

Give it a try if you want to try eating an exotic animal in burger form. I won't be coming back.

I heard a lot of good things about this restaurant from a few friends and decided to try it out to see what the hype was all about. 
The hype is justified ... this is one of the best new restaurants I tried in a long time. The staff was friendly and helpful and the food was prompt and very tasty. 
We had a variety of dishes and my absolute favorite was the black cod. It was tender, juicy and absolutely delicious. 
The jumbo beef rib was very good too. It wouldn't be a great first date dish as it's messy to eat but I'd still highly recommend it.
We are already talking about when to go back.

I've been wanting to try this place since I tasted their goods at the Taste of Calgary last summer. Maybe it was an off day or my expectations were too high but I thought my experience could've been better. I ordered the beef brisket and the dry rib tips. The beef brisket was tasty but I've had more tender and flavourful brisket before. I didn't care for the dry rib tips at all ... too much bone and fat and not enough meat, I thought. If I go back, I'll try something different. Warning: the spicy Chili is really spicy (I can eat hot stuff but even I found it to be very hot).

This is one of my new (new to me, anyway) favorite restaurants!  I went there for the first time for lunch and had the Croque Madame and it was delicious.  There was something about the bread, cheese, ham, and fried egg on top that just melted in my mouth.  The location is fantastic, just off of 17th Avenue in Mount Royal Village.  It wasn't too busy when I went so I sat on the patio and people-watched.  The decor is very European; I felt like I was in a small bistro in Paris.  I highly recommend Parc.

I really hope that the owner or management cares enough about their business to check up on these reviews... I can't give any opinion on the food because I had taken all I could before I was able to try it. I walked in and was told I could sit where I liked, I chose a booth. There was plenty of seating because the place was dead. My waitress asked for my drink order and I asked about specials...she said there were none....I asked for a drink menu and she said they didn't have one, they just had "the regular stuff". I ordered a Miller Lite draft...a couple minutes later she came back and said they didn't have Miller on draft so I asked for a bottle. When she asked for my food order I asked for the Ultimate Bacon Platter on the appetizer menu. A few minutes later she returned and said they were out of 2 of the items that were on the platter. When she told me that(with no remorse or empathy) I had experienced all of this establishment that I wanted so I paid for my one beer and left. I will not be returning. My wife and I just moved to Gastonia a few weeks ago and I have been trying to convince her to try it with me because it looked interesting and I obviously love bacon, but she was very resistant....luckily I tried it alone on this occasion so I don't have to hear the "I told you so"s.

I have boarded my three dogs multiple times with rosewood, the Resort Vacation for my younger dogs and Home Vacation package for my older dog. I cannot be happier with the professional service they provide. I have spoken to a few staffs there and they all genuinely cared about my pets. The staffs are very friendly, and they spend the time to chat with me about my dogs' stay. They remember each of my pets by name and my dogs love going back, they must have lots of fun there! I was told that the owners of rosewood are all professional dog trainers, that explains why my dogs behave better when they come home from boarding. I feel very comfortable boarding my dogs knowing they are in good hands, I have boarded my dogs with other boarding facilities and none of them give me the same confidence rosewood gives me. Highly recommended!

The poutine has been sitting on the counter the cheese was solid and cold when it got to us. The grilled cheese hamburger was just a bad grilled cheese with a bad hamburger patty. We asked for onions rings and the server substituted it with fries without first informing us, claiming they are out of onion rings.

What a complete disappointment. It has gone all the way downhill. I used to enjoy this place a lot when it was good and it was expensive. Now the sushi is cheap and it shows. There must have been a change of ownership. The rice tastes wrong, the fish is cut wrong. The shrimp in the dynamic roll looks and tastes more like a frozen spring roll. The food is seriously just barely edible.

I have to say that Shaun is the best in the business. He is very responsive and has a great selection of clubs to choose from. This past weekend, he was able to get us into Hakkasan's guest list and our group had a great time. This is not the first experience with Shaun. I'm very thankful that he was able to get my wife and her bachelorette party into a club in Vegas, after giving him a call on a very short notice, the day prior to them getting to Vegas. Shaun is very easy to work with and is a genuine person, as he follows up to make sure everything at the club is going alright. I really appreciate Shaun, and is the only person I would hit up when going out to Vegas. As always, Shaun, we appreciate you!

DO NOT ORDER PIZZA FROM THIS PLACE !!!  The franchise owner "John" promised a simple replacement pizza for the soggy, undercooked and room temprature pizza I paid for. After 3 subsequent calls to complain and being promised I'd get a "correct" pizza, nothing has been done. John promised today (my third call) that he'd follow through with a letter to me after he blamed his staff. Come on ... take responsibility and maybe attempt recovery.This place is Horrible and I'm 100% convinced that the Franchise Owner, "John" is to blame. Not the staff. I've contacted the Corporate Office about the lack of follow through and disengaged attitude of "John". What a joke   over a $20 pizza.

FANTASTIC!!!!
These guys know the basics about customer service infused with super-flavorful thai food. We've been coming here for a year (about 8 times). Friendly, fast, clean and fresh tasting thai food. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Not in a fancy big box stand alone building but clean and worth the visit. You won't go wrong I promise. Try the Pad Thai, Deep Fried Tofu and 'F5" Spicy Thai Basil. Fresh and mouthwatering. Oh and the price ... very affordable. ENJOY this GEM!!!!

Don't waste your money or time. Food was absolutely HORRIBLE! We ordered the fish taco's with rice and beans & two house margarita's. Fish Taco's $14.95 and had absolutely no taste at all. Clearly the kitchen doesn't taste what they send out. It was very fast though ... probably microwaved. No lime/spanish seasoning/flavor what so ever. And the deciding factor? This is our second time because we thought we might have caught them on a bad day two months ago when we tried them. I used come here in the 1980's and it was always awesome and you had to wait to get in. No so anymore. Very few customers. The frozen cod called fish is flavorless as is the rice. Try Jalisco's up on Durango and near the 215. Worth the drive and has authentic flavor. They also are friendly with excellent prices far below this worn out old, canned sauce, microwave tasteless fare. Too bad. It used to be the "gold standard" now it's worse than Del Taco. I warned you!!!

Just moved to AZ and was looking for a place to get brows done. Happened to find this awesome spot on Yelp. Janelle did an awesome job on my eyebrows. She really took her time to get it done right.

Went there because of the yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Computer wouldn't turn on at all. They looked at it right away without even writing a ticket. Plugged in a different power supply as troubleshooting and it came on. Then they blew me away with it will be ready in a half hour. I came back in an hour and it was ready, cleaned inside and out and a totally reasonable price for a bigger power supply than the original and great service.

Service was horrible. No one took our drink orders, the waitress took our food order, but didn't ask about drinks until we had to ask someone about it. 

5 people at our table and they brought out each dish one at a time with several minutes in between. Who does that? 

Waitress disappeared when it was time for the check, the manager finally brought it over and finished for her. While we were eating we saw another party waiting at the door for their check. 

Food was great if you don't mind bad service.

I work on the strip and thought this would be a good lunch time activity. Range price is only $10, but it's small and if there are tourists (or anyone) shooting machine gun or rifle, it's really really loud. 

Store is pretty good if you can find what you want without help. Almost have to beg someone to help at the counter. Told one salesman the gun I wanted to look at and he immediately goes into how I should get quality since my life may depend on it.

Told the salesman I just want a gun to shoot paper and something my wife can shoot. Not carrying, concealed or going to a war zone. Just want to buy a first gun to see if me and my wife like it and want to do more. 

Have to get quality and something dependable, ME: So your store sells undependable crap? They don't, but I should get the expensive one. (paraphrasing).

Transferred from an online store something they don't even have in stock, never carry and never will. Went there during lunch and a different salesman acted like he didn't really didn't want to do a transfer, it showed and he made it clear. 

Small old run down range, 2 or 3 good salespeople if you're lucky to get one of them. If I go there again it's for something quick and painless like something that's on a rack or if their ammo is on sale. 

Definitely for the tourist and not locals.

Thanks to yelp! Otherwise I would have not found this place. The service here is great and fair prices. I watched two other customers pay for their service and they both seemed happy when they finished. As soon as I walked in, another customer asked if I had been there before (no) and immediately started saying how fair the prices were and how great the service was. This is NOT a franchise. The owner is there everyday at the front desk and most of the time you deal with him direct. Incredible place and they deserve all the support and great reviews they have.

Service was TERRIBLE!  Told us we had to wait 35 minutes even though we had a reservation!!!  3 of 4 of us were there (ontime) and the 4th person was running late.  The hostess said they wouldn't sit us without the entire party so they cancelled the entire reservation and put us on a waiting list for 35 minutes.  The hostess was rude and didn't even tell the party that was there on time that this would happen.  Unacceptable and unbelievable!  Never has this happened to me at any restaurant ever...

So, interestingly enough, I was reading the reviews that the food was good (or great) but the service was terrible... honestly, I had just the opposite experience. The food could have been a lot better (I mean, the soup was almost cold), and the pasta flavor was very bland, but our waitress, she was a delight! If I remember correctly, I think her name is Jane (though memory could betray me). She was on top of her game- she is the only reason why I gave this place a 3 stars and not one.
She made appropriate suggestions, was fast in processing our orders, and had a very pleasant personality. I sincerely hope Mimi's Cafe improves their food, otherwise, because in the restaurant industry, it's not just about the service or the food, it's about having the best of both worlds!

The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I can't finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home. 
I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. You'll get a good mix of everything and you'll leave without regrets!

Met a friend during lunch hour and it took forever to get a hibachi dish and some sushi.  The server came across as if we were bothering her.  All her attention was on the 6 top next to us.  The food itself was alright once we got it.  We basically had to trip the server to get her to give us enough attention to ask for the check.  It surprisingly took no time to get our money but she got no tip from me.

Two stars b/c Sara our server was uber-professional and spot-on. It started off with the dual hostesses pointing our 6 top group to a booth in front of the door on a freezing night but the table across the aisle had 6-8 coats hanging on the hooks for our booth and we couldn't get in. We asked for another table and were treated like idiots for even asking such a stupid question. After openly scoffing and scowling at us we got another table. Right next to a group of a dozen 7-8 year olds who had no adult supervision and ran around screaming and throwing shit around the room. We actually pulled our tables back from them to give them more running room. After all this crap the food came out and was  - meh.....
Our server was great to us and embarrassed for the restaurant itself...
Stay away from this place...there a ton of better places in the Waterfront

Best steak in Vegas. Best mashed potatoes in Vegas. Best French restaurant in Vegas.

MAKE MAKE MAKE RESERVATIONS!

Decided to leave this place as our last meal in Vegas and I wouldn't want to have it any other way. Our server made our experience 10x times better. He was extremely attentive and friendly. He knew when to stop by and when not to. He knew what to recommend and to describe how everything was prepared. I will never forget asking him what the special of the night was and how well he described it that I had to ordered it. Beef Wellington. Unfortunately, they had run out of it. So he recommended I got the filet mignon, as this is what the restaurant is well known for. I do not regret listening to him. The steak was cooked perfectly. Medium never tasted so good. My brother had the filet mignon as well but his was with mashed potatoes and mine with fries. I ended up leaving him without mashed potatoes because they were too good for me not to eat them off his plate. They were creamy, fluffy and soft at the same time. 

No wonder this place is always packed. 

They will definitely be seeing me again.

Can you please open on of these in NYC?!

I fell in love with this place. The food. The service. The ambiance. Even the location was perfect. 
It's away from the Vegas strip which can be a bit too loud for one to enjoy a nice meal but at the same time its so close to Fremont St that has a lot to offer. The restaurant is located exactly across from the back of the Container Park, which by the way everyone should go to. 

The wait time here is tricky, it depends at what time you show up. But don't be taken back by the amount of people waiting, every second you wait will be worth it once you go in and eat. 

The menu is very basic, but everything sounds great and if you are like me you will find yourself looking at other table sot see what people ordered. So everywhere I turned everything looked amazingly good. For appetizer, we had some biscuits with strawberry sauce drizzled with confectionery sugar....TO DIE FOR. As soon as we took a bite of the biscuit we knew that we were in for a good eat. 
For main course i went for the pancakes with an apple sausage and my brother and mom went for the breaded steak, yes STEAK. When they ordered they missed the part that said steak so when they went in for the cut they say that it was not a fried chicken breast, it was steak. And holy moly was that a big piece of steak. Both of them could of ate from one plate. The steak came with two eggs and potatoes. As to my pancakes, it was a simple dish, but boy were those pancakes huge.  They gave me three I only ate one and a half. I couldn't do it. And let's just say that for the price I did not mind not being able to finish it all.

I think two people or even three could eat off one entree. The portions are humongous and the price is very reasonable. Something that caught  my attention was the decor, as it matches the theme of the restaurant. The staff is friendly, but should try accommodating guest better. They have these fans on at all times plus the AC, so even in Vegas weather, it is really cold in the dining area. We asked if we could change tables and it was like if we asked if we could leave without paying. So we just decided to stay were we were, and even though our food got cold due to this we enjoy our meal and took the leftovers.  Overall, make sure to come hungry and ready to take a bag with you.

Ever since dining at Francesco's while on vacation in Vegas, I salivate just thinking of the Veal Parmigiana.  My boyfriend and I shared the Veal that was served just like a Pizza (almost bigger then a small pizza and flattened out encrusted in Parmesan).  It melted in your mouth and had the perfect flavor.  For our entree, we also split a nightly pasta special (seafood cavitelle) which was also incredibly good.  For startes we had the grilled calamari, goat cheese salad, and bruschetta to start with.  The calamari was our fave of the 3 apps.  The ambiance was very warm and charming yet upscale.  It's like you are in an Italian Villa.  Highly recommend!

After staying at the Wynn in Las Vegas last week, it'll be tough to want to stay elsewhere during my next visit to Sin City.  The hotel is elegance at its finest.  It evokes a warm feel though due to the colorful tiled floors and flowers everywhere.  I especially loved the fresh floral arrangements at registration and in the lobby of the resort elevators (changed daily) and was an enormous array of the brightest, freshest, flowers.  Walking the esplanade at the Wynn only offered me dreams of being able to walk in Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and their fine shoe store 'Shoe In' and not being alarmed at the sight of a $700 pair of heals.  It was however fun to dream.  We never had the chance to have dinner at the hotel but we had brunch at the Terrace Point Cafe which was delicious and I was also satisfied with my ahi tuna salad by the pool.  Our room was incredible.  We stayed in the resort room which offered an incredible view of the strip with floor to ceiling windows.  I loved the flat screen television in the bathroom (which by the way was bigger than most apartments in NYC).  The service was good and I loved all the extra little touches (foot mats placed on either side of the bed during turn down service and the carpet floral patterns on the luggage carts!)  Highly recommend but prepare to pay!

The girls show no love for couples. The girls look good and are very young. I'm assuming new strippers as they are almost all pre-tit jobs. (don't expect big tattas) I'm not sure what their deal is with couples; maybe they are too new to realize there is great money to be made and are scared the female will have jealousy issues. For Pete's sake, she's in an all nude strip club! The girls actually try to work the pole and it's a great place for men by themselves, but the customer service from the staff (I helped another unknown female patron from throwing up all over the place. I was annoyingly waved off by their staff Wtf??!) and the girls themselves is non existent. Hundreds would have been dropped, but they never bothered to approach us on two different - months apart visits. Their loss.

Recpetionists and  waiter assigned to our table deserve 5 stars. Very accomodating, warm, and service-oriented. 

We came for a Thursday lunch, slow day for the restaurant. Price was reasonable. Food selection  limited. Food presentation appeals to your senses. However, the taste was more of on the salty side.

I thought that the "so-so" menu selection and food quality was going to be compensated by the excellent service of the staff. However, our dining experience felt disappointing towards the end.

I was making my way back to my table after using from the restroom.  After walking by one of the servers (her name is pronounced A-chi), who was at that time bussing dishes, I heard her say "Hi!" with a high tone of voice, somewhat arrogant, not friendly at all. She asked if I was looking for something. She kinda mellowed down with the tone of voice after she found out that I was a customer at the restaurant. That was really so disappointing!!! I just felt discriminated. Not a good experience.

Stopped in for a quick lunch while running errands in the plaza and notice this new place and so decided to check out if they have an a la carte menu. They did. The server gave me their folded printed menu (same as their take out menu).   And while I looked thru one of the servers pointed out to me that the daily and lunch specials on the back of the menu.  And on that same page I notice they also put "15% off. For any purchase with us! Cash only. Expiry date will be informed in advance".   The food was okay, not great. And so when they gave me the bill I asked for the 15% off as I will pay cash.  The server then told me that the discount special does not apply to the daily and lunch specials. I asked if it is expired they did not say so before "in advance". She said "no" it does not apply to the specials. WHAT!!! The same specials that is printed on the same page just above the 15% off notice does not apply.  I pointed out to them that it does not say that on the menu. So I just paid my bill and walked out. Not worth arguing over the stupidness of how they plan their printing as I do not plan to return to this place.   How do I add a picture to this review so you can see their menu.

Wish I had read the reviews before paying my money. Booked a shuttle (have to prepay), shuttle never showed, then when after waiting 15 minutes I called they told me it would be "another 5 or 10 minutes) and acted like they couldn't understand why I wanted a refund. Of course the person on the phone told me I had to talk to "customer service", which is a voicemail machine. Go out of business, showtime.

What a TERRIBLE experience.  One of the boys that worked there sold me the wrong part - after a while, a pool guy sent me back to get the right part. I went back and was told the boy doesn't work there anymore and "what's in the past is in the past". 
Unbelievable. 
So, they slapped some old parts on my Hayward pool vac that the guy got out of his garage.  (I kid you not) And to rub salt in the wound, I had to pay $60 for more replacement parts.  As I was paying I asked "so no apology? - no discount?".  The guy said nope.
So, those of you living in Morrison Ranch - you have been warned!

(Looks like someone jumped back into Yelp with a GLOWING review to offset my real review.  Pretty obvious when it shows up the same morning.)

I really loved living here, but when it was time for me to move and put in my 30 day notice, the manager refused to take my written 30 day notice.  The manager asked me when I wanted to move,  I told him the 3rd of the next month.  I had the letter in hand 30 days before moving and the manager said you dont need to give me the letter, I'll remember.  Unfortunately, he didnt recall saying that, now I didn't get my full deposit back, only $145 of the $614.  MY FAULT FOR NOT GETTING ANYTHING IN WRITING OF WHAT HE SAID AND SIGNED.  BE CAREFUL AND LEARN FROM ME, GET IT IN WRITING, DONT EVER ACCEPT A VERBAL AGREEMENT WHEN MONEY IS INVOLVEF.  From this experience, I will DO BUSINESS BETTER and always make sure to get any agreement in writing and signed.

Phone service was friendly, helpful and the pizza arrived on time!

Two years ago, October of 2012, I sought out treatment from Dr. Collin Udall.  He saw me immediately which was nice.  He diagnosed my condition, then said to do a follow up.  The follow up he changed his mind and said he misdiagnosed me and to take more pills.  I was in excruciating pain.  He ignored my calls and wouldn't return my voicemails. Long story short it took a total of 10 doctors and two years to finally figure out what was wrong, and Dr. Udall could've figured it out if he just would have tried. He'll kick you to the curb.  He doesn't care.  Go somewhere else.

I came across this gym when I bought a groupon that included boot camp classes from this gym.  At first when you walk in, you do notice the equipment is outdated.  But the main trainer is one of the best I've experienced.  I felt it was ideal for beginners and those who have experience training.  

Every boot camp class was different and I attended 3 a week. Different music was played each class, so it was never the same.  Each boot camp class had different exercises so I was never bored.  We worked on every aspect of exercise, core, cardio, weight training, stretching, etc.  The teacher did go back and forth from English and Spanish which I thought was considerate since both Spanish and English speaking people were attending the class.  

One of the things I noticed was since I had bought a groupon, the trainers at the gyms I attended are notified you're a groupon buyer, almost like a label, and didn't show as much attention to me as they did to others.  As a groupon buyer you're not paying full price so it can show from the place you're at they won't give you full service.  At this gym this wasn't the case.  On two different occasions I was the only one who showed up for the boot camp class and instead of him cancelling he provided 1 on 1 personal training.  He was basically working for free but trained me like a full paying customer.  

Bottom line he's an excellent trainer who knows his stuff and cares about everyone that walks in the door.  The gym may not be the biggest or the newest but that's nothing in comparison to receiving quality training.  And that's what you'll get at GAP fitness.

The Big Cheese?  I'm sorry, but this place should really be called "Fries and Gravy". 

There were hardly any curds.  I'd give it 4 stars if the big cheese served big cheese, but they don't.  I heart poutine.  I hope they pick 
up the slack.  That is all.

EDIT: You can order extra curds for $1.25.  You need to add curdsx 3 to make it reasonable.  Makes a small poutine about ~$11.  You decide.

Great place!  I'm very picky about stylists, but the one I booked with was also the owner & he did a fantastic men's cut - very good skills.  As for female stylings, an acquaintance of mine had one of the best hair transformations I've ever seen.  It's actually what prompted me to check the place out in the first place.

 It's a fairly new place & feels like you've found a hidden gem when you walk in.  I won't be surprised if this place is overrun with business in a year's time. 
As it stands there are no other reviewers, kind of strange.  So check it out ppl & post a review.

Awesome smoke house. Check it out after some chinook shopping. 
Now open evenings.

Super cheap, super flavorful.  If you like Palamino or Bookers, you have to try this place because it just might edge those places out.

Being a big fan of spicy fare I have tried all of the mexican restaurants in the city. This is the best one. But, but, but there is one caveat...you need to know the secret. 
The secret is hiding in the impossibly big menu. Get the MEXICANA COMBINATION!  That's it. It's huge, it comes out in a reasonable time, & it is the best Mexican meal in the city.  You will be very satisfied after this one.  I opt for the mole (pron: molay) over the tomato sauce as well.  For spice, throw on their red AND green El Yucatan habanero sauces that are sitting at the tables. Careful with these though, they are quite flavorful, but unforgivingly hot. Unless you have an iron stomach, go easy the first few times cowboys & girls.  You'll see what I mean. 
They also happen to have some very nice tequila kicking around ;)
I have gone here 2 nights in a row on several occasions.  (Just make sure you walk in & they see you when you first get there so you're seated right away.)

This is a great, nay the best, place to grab pitas in downtown with more than fresh ingredients - including spinach :)
They recently moved 2 blocks away to 1508 4th Street SW.
This is just a block north of 17th ave sw on 4th St.

Follow @pitapiton4th on twitter to get in on their deal list too  :D
(Just like @Charcut's alley burgers.)

Seeing as the only review here doesn't really cover anything but a bad experience with the entrance staff, let's get down to business & get a real review going *ahem* here are the basics: 

- It's a great gym with the best equipment I've come across.  That said I enjoy speed & power training.  So the track and plethora of strength equipment are fantastic.  I really enjoy the hammer strength brand machines, they are just the most solid machines out there with the best ranges of motions.  The free weights are amazing & rarely am I waiting on weights.  The one thing lacking: kickboxing bags.

-Swimming pools, hottubs, and a yoga room - with free classes are also here.  I rarely use them, so somebody else should review these.  

-It can be busy, but people are quite accommodating and will share equipment; make some friends ppl :) 

-The staff will teach you basically anything for free & there is some serious experience kicking around.  Some not so experienced too, so just be choosy, as always.

-I'm only giving it 4 stars because it is a huge facility and lacks a certain social or community atmosphere.  It is what you make it, but the size of the facility can be a bit daunting at times.  That said, for coming in and getting your workout done, it can't be beat.

-I've been going here as one of my gyms for 3 years.

Carly's Angels!  This is the real reason we're here.  Every Saturday night the house is packed and a hilarious drag comedy show takes place.  I have been twice in the past 6 months and have been thoroughly entertained.  

All I can say is if you are even remotely interested, you need to go.  The energy & comedy that goes into the shows are fantastic.  You will not be disappointed.

A great place to go as a couple, couple of friends, birthday party or stagette.  If you're a larger group, it may take a few months to book in so make sure to call.

Tickets are around $60 for the show & do not include dinner & drinks.  That said, the drinks must be kind of part of that because a 1 litre of Newcastle beer was only $6 :D  So they encourage you to go and get plastered...alllll right :)

As well, the restaurant will be changing to Salt & Peppers mexican very soon, so the food is about to get a whole lot better.  I have never had the food here because it is sooooo not about that.  It's about having drinks with friends and watching the Angels!   A lot of audience participation too.

One more note...this show, somehow is really funny for people of all ages (18+ due to the comedy content).  Very very funny.  GO!

Went to Hanny's at 9:00 p.m. and had drinks and a meal - with a party of seven.  We were seated immediately, but the place filled up and was busy by 9:30 p.m.  Service was slow, but in defense of our waiter, he appeared to be handling about half of the tables.  Food was excellent.  We ordered three pizzas: carne, prosciutto, and blanco.  I love meat, and assumed that the carne pizza would be my favorite.  It was great, but the prosciutto was better.  This pizza is every bit as good as Bianco's, if not better, and you can get in without being made to feel like the object of condescension.  Finally, they have a five dollar martini that was excellent.  (Don't forget to have the donuts for dessert.  They are good - but I think in the past they were better.)  My wife had the beet salad which was a little light on beets and heavy on arugula.  Otherwise, outstanding food, even the "onion strings" that we had as an appetizer.  (Oh, and the atmosphere is very cool, from the elevator shaft, to the lighting to the old signs.)

I have been twice, each time for a chili dog to go.  It's an easy order, but the first time it took almost ten minutes, despite few customers, and the second time about half as long.  Both times an employee asked what I was waiting for, and only then did they find my order.  I was not the only person that waited, on each occasion, for an inordinate amount of time for an order.

The first time a manager felt bad about how long I had been standing there and "comped" me some fries, which I threw away because they were soggy and just gross.  The second time, despite ordering it to go, the chili dog came in a basket to eat "in".    

The chili dog had onions on it (nobody asked if I wanted onions) and the cashier was effectively hidden behind a stack of styrofoam cups. The chili dog was slightly better than a 7/11 product, but at almost triple the price and with a long wait.  Another customer had a gyro, which looked appetizing, but I am not sure I will be back to try it.    

I was hoping for someplace where I could grab something to bring back to the office but it doesn't appear that this is the place.  Huge space, with a small crowd (five or six employees or more, and approximately ten or fifteen guests).  Until they improve how fast the food gets out, the crowd will dwindle even more.

Need to come back to give it five stars!  Great service with attentive staff.  Sat outside with a few flies but not bad.  Inside looked great and outside was perfect for having grandkids with us.  All of our dishes were well received: hash, breakfast chimi, hamburger and baked cauliflower.  I don't like cauliflower much but this was delicious.  Baked with lemon and still crisp it's a must try.  Burger was good, fries better.  Pancakes weren't bad.  Toasted brioche was good but could use a second egg. Prices were acceptable with a bottomless mimosa for 18 bucks. We'll be back.

Outstanding knowledge of cruisers, mountain and road bikes.  I have been to all of the other bike shops in town and Joe and his crew are the most knowledgable.  If they don't have what you need they will order it.  And they will even send you to their competitors if you are desperate for parts. Great selection of cruisers and an improving selection of road bikes.  They now carry a great selection of Cannondale  road bikes.  Looking for baskets and cruiser saddles, look no further.  The only drawback is a lack of more items for road bikes.

Mondays are best at Maizie's when they have their signature burger on sale.  The burger is a good size (half pound) for sharing and comes with lettuce, tomato and onion and your choice of cheese. Any other time get the inside out burger - a burger stuffed with blue cheese.  My favorite.  

And whenever you go, have the wingless buffalo dip. Good cheese with chunks of chicken and lots of spice served with chips and pita bread. It is required eating. 

Finally, Maizie's has beer and wine specials that go well with their menu.  There are a couple of tv's that always have games on and the service is usually pretty good.

Great place to try out all the brews made by Phoenix and Sonora.  I recommend the flight  and just ask your bartender or waitress for suggestions. They are very knowledgeable about beer. Pick George's brain for beer information - he's a walking encyclopedia of beer. (For younger patrons, an encyclopedia is like Google, but on paper).  The tasting room is just that - clean and welcoming.  

We had the Phoestivus last night, which is a slightly sweet ale with cinnamon.  Very Christmasy.

We've been to Otro many times. Stick with the tacos or the chorizo and egg dishes.  They are consistently delicious. The margaritas are good.  The guacamole is good and sometimes excellent and the chips are crisp.  We have had one bad experience there but the situation was immediately addressed by a manager and the bill was graciously adjusted.  Service is usually excellent and the atmosphere is cool. Sit at the bar and watch the bartender make drinks - it will give you an appreciation for how hard thy work and what goes into some of their drinks.  Didn't care much for the paella but on the whole we like just about everything else.   (Sit away from the west facing windows in the late afternoon as it is hot!). This is a perfect place for a casual dinner. The background noise is low so you can enjoy conversation and the food.

Went at 4:00 on a Friday afternoon. We had two little girls with us and the bartender was great, got them lemonade and cookies and popcorn.  I had a great ale, while my compadres had a flight of red wine and a flight of white wine. Prices are ok, with a special of buy a flight get a flight for half off. $22 for a flight with some pretty tasty wine from Macedonia (although not all were great). Excellent atmosphere and a good crowd. Even thought the prices are a bit high compared to other happy hours we will go back.  This would be a great place for later in the evening.  Just beer and wine and a very limited food menu.

Objectively: $93 for an 8 oz filet (with a potato cake), salmon, Brussel sprouts, and a carafe of wine. Plenty of food for two people.  Subjectively: great.  The steak had a fantastic sear on it with a peppery taste and the meat was done perfectly, still juicy and tender. The salmon was moist and flaky.  I even liked the Brussel sprouts that were shaved and toasted.  (And I don't like Brussel sprouts!).  The potato cake had but one problem - too small.  Otherwise a near perfect tasting dinner.  Del Frisco's is an anomaly - hardly ever packed but turning out some of the best food. This steak certainly was on par with Durants and Donovan's.  (The ambience is in keeping with a "grill" and could be changed to make it a more intimate setting.). The carafe was a good deal at $19 and gave us almost four glasses of wine.  Enjoy!

Warm atmosphere, smiling faces and cold beer!  Oh and a great menu with excellent food. Try the meatballs and the mignulata. Very delicious. Pizza choices include tasty standards like sausage (from local favorite DeFalco's) and more trendy tastes like fig and goat cheese. I wish it was closer to home. We would have our own permanent table!

One of our favorites restaurants. Slightly higher priced than some restaurants but definitely worth it.  Portions are very generous and food is fantastically flavorful.  Nice ambiance too, think casual elegance.  The rice is the best anywhere around.  They also have some additional unusual varieties of rices for those who want to be adventurous. The multiple protein plate options on the menu give a nice variety.  The koobideh (spiced minced meat kabob) is so delicious here.  Something really nice is that you can get koobideh as a side order to an entree which is a great deal and allows you to try multiple things. If you have not been to the Persian room definitely make it a priority to experience this wonderful place!

Great customer service.  We had to wait a while for our dessert so when we asked how much longer they apologized for the wait & said it was on the house which was really nice. Then when we went to pay they had taken the drinks off as well for any inconvenience which shows they really care. Food is good. Macaroon ice cream sandwhich was great. First time trying Pandan flavor ice cream and highly recommend it.

Really like Kawaii for multiple reasons. We first tried this place with a discount offer and it happened to be during happy hour. They were happy to honor the discount on the happy hour specials too which is something we appreciate as it shows they are not petty and that they care about customer service.  We ordered some extra stuff because of this just so they did not lose money on us. Their kindness payed off with good karma. 
    We have been back several times and had sushi rolls.  However, my husband does not like seaweed so ask the rolls to be made with soy paper instead.  They were happy to do it and did not charge anything extra for it unlike many other sushi places that will add an extra charge. Once again we really appreciate the customer service. 
     Another thing they have is a Sunday brunch all you can eat sushi offering. This is unusual in Arizona and love that they do it. Going out for sushi can often add up quick no matter were you go and for what a few rolls might cost you could do all you can eat at Kawaii during Sunday brunch.  Now they do limit the sashimi to 4 slices of each type of fish but no limit on rolls or nigiri and furthermore it includes for no additional charge some appetizers and drink options as well which makes it a nice experience.

Enjoyed Greektown.  Much better than other Greek places around that we have tried.  Did feel it was just slightly overpriced compared to portion but food was quite good. 
     I love cheesecake and was a little surprised they had a cheesecake as an option for dessert and it is clearly home made because they were baking it and had to see if it was done before we could order it. It was an exceptional cheesecake but also a little different than the usual cheesecake.  Guessing there is Greek yogurt in there but not sure.  Anyways, delicious!  
     This is a family run place so in my book that is a plus.  We left payment and tip on the table and left.  Next thing we know the owner George comes out into the parking lot to catch us to say thank you and goodbye.  Most places would not do that. Clearly shows they care.

If I ever willingly come back to Cleveland, it will be for the Brussel Sprouts at The Greenhouse Tavern. Service was fantastic (Thanks Kevin!), and the aesthetic? Lovely. I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tasted--duck confit wings, Brussel Sprouts (pan fried in a maple reduction--amazing), and venison bolognese (a little spicy but alotta tasty). For dessert, the pot de creme is a must. If I could give 6 stars, I definitely would!

Per my previous reviews of Sew Little Time anyone can tell I am a fan. This time I asked Amelia & David (owners) to professionally embroider my grandson's initials on a stiff/thick nylon duffle bag. I asked that the font and thread color match what was already on the bag -- it is perfect! And it was done lickity-split in time for mailing for Christmas. I have a home-style embroidery machine and was afraid my machine and I just weren't experienced for the nylon fabric. I am very glad I asked them to do it, and I will be back for professional embroidery -- and all the other goodies offered at their store.

This company is horrible. I ordered some plastic business cards and it took them almost 2 weeks to even put them into production. Then when I finally received the order the colors on the card were so much darker than the actually proof they sent me to approve. Is this company is very cheap in price and very, very cheap in quality. There customer service is on the bottom of the barrel. They did not try at all to rectify the problem. They wanted more money to fix the problem that exist with there poor quality printing. PLEASE BE AWARE STAY AWAY ITS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Shane came out to fix our garage door problem.  He was was very courteous and a hard worker.  However, a week later we had the same garage door problem.  This time another technician came out named Andrew.  Equally courteous, worked hard and was very knowledgeable.  He was very thorough in explaining to us what he had done.  He fixed the problem and there was no additional charge.  I would definitely  use A1 garage door repair again in the future.

I really love this show! It delivers the WOW!-factor with all the Cirque-type amazing aqua-acrobatics, and keeps you entertained the whole way through. Seriously, the performers were doing twists & turns & jumps & moves I didn't even know  was humanly possible. The diving segment was my favorite. Hats off to all the amazing performers!! 

A little tip about the seating..... The venue is an intimate circular theater, with the circular pool in the center as it's stage. There are only 12 rows of seating, so yes, basically every seat has a great view & you really can't go wrong. The first 2 rows are considered "splash zone" ($105/seat), the next 9 rows (Rows 3-11) are Premium seats ($129/seat) and the last row (Row 12) is the VIP/Dream seats (ranging from $155 to $195/seat.).  I have sat in the 1st row (splash) and 5th row (premium) and can honestly say I much preferred the premium row. I'm not discouraging the splash zone seats because of the threat of getting wet.... In fact, I only got a sprinkle of water while in the first row (if even that)! The reason I suggest the premium section is because this show has SO much to see and by sitting a bit further back, you'll be able to take in more visually.  There is also a lot of the acts happening high up (way high up, from the ceiling).... and I found myself straining my neck to see all that was going on up high, whereas you could view it all at ease sans the neck strain if you were in premium:)  Also, I don't think it's worth it to get the VIP/Dream seats.... other than it offering a super plushy comfy chair (and champagne & choco covered strawberries) , one of the perks to those seats is that it includes a video monitor in front the seat, which I heard is streaming you live feed of all the backstage and underwater action during the show, but believe me, you'll have so much to watch on stage, I don't think you want to waste your time watching the monitor ;)

BEST SHOW EVER! 

This show has such an amazing energy! I didn't know much about Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons before watching this.... but you don't need to. You will be amazed at how many of these songs you will recognize (& love!), and the story is told so well, with AMAZING performers delivering impeccable vocals, dancing/choreography & acting.... that truly bring you back to the era, like you are right there livin it with Frankie! It's moving. It's captivating. You will leave the show with a huge smile on your face, a hop & skip in your step, and you will NOT be able to stop humming all the fabulous songs in your head for days! 

Just a few of the HITS that will get stuck in your head: 
- Sherry
- Can't Take My Eyes Off of You
- Big Girls Don't Cry
- Who Loves You
- Oh What a Night! December 1963
- Walk Like a Man
- Bye Bye Baby
- I've Got You Under My Skin

Quick tidbit on seating:
JB has been at "Paris Theater" since March 2012. It's a bigger stage & venue than when it was at Palazzo (where it reigned from 2008 thru 2011). Other than size, another difference is that this new theater does not have a balcony. You are either in the front half (Orchestra section), or back half (Mezzanine). When I got my tix, I was told that the last row (Row M) was only 75 feet away from the stage, implying that even the last row has a good view of the stage. I ended up getting seats in Row K (third row from the back), and they were right! You still have a great view of everything. :)

I've seen JB twice, and can't wait to see it again!!!!!

Lucky Las Vegas!! Now you have 2 NOBU's gracing your city! Congrats to Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his business partner, Robert DeNiro (!!) on their beautiful newest creation..... NOBU at Caesar's Palace, LV!  

First, a few fun facts:
- The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013 
- Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide! 
- The NOBU Hotel, a "boutique hotel" which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first "NOBU Hotel" ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)  

Now, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.

Now, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!

1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!)
six (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking "should I order another round now or later?" as they are finishing off this one ;) 

2) Black Cod w/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!)
So succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't "pass" on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :) 

3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!)
This comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, "las vegas", and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their "own" trio :) It was super fresh n delicious! 

4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!)
OK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces. 

5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16
This was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle... 

6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14
If you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!

Dessert
We went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15
Flourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience. 

I'm already thinking about when I can go back again. Maybe Nobu will consider his next venue in the Bay Area? SF and San Jose would love one!!!!! :oD !!

Julian Serrano is amazing! I would give this 10 stars if that was an option! 

Initially, I didn't even want to go here..... because my first impression was that it was going to be tiny servings with a fancy bow & big $$$ tag, that would leave me still hungry for more. Boy, was I wrong! Every dish ordered was prepared and cooked to perfection. Bursts of flavor, fabulous presentation, reasonable portions, and just overall a wonderful experience for the tastebuds. Love the decor & ambiance too. 

Below are a few comments on the dishes I will be crawling back for :) And please note: I did not try all of the below in one sitting. The list includes dishes tried on 3 different sittings :) 

MUST HAVES! 
- Tuna Cones - this was my favorite dish! I wanted another order! But btw, i think it's only available at dinner. I didn't see it available on their lunch menu :( 
- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers - so delish! especially if you like goat cheese & mushrooms. Was my second favorite dish! 
- Ahi Tuna Tempura - maybe because I love both Ahi Tuna & Tempura, but I thought this was just scrumptious
- Tuna Raspberry Skewers - a nice twist of flavors. 
- White Ceviche - this ceviche was divine! My only complaint was it was a bit heavy on the lime, but then again I'm just not a lime fan ;) 
- Spanish Chicken Croquetas - kinda like fried mozzarella stick, but with chicken & creamy bechamel sauce! I really liked this. Note: I luv creamy/cheesy stuff.  
- Grilled Lamp Chops - very tasty & tender

GOOD!, but nothing to scream about: 
- Wild Mushroom Soup - again, it was really GOOD! but I would prefer getting a second order of something above if given a choice :) 
- Lobster Salad 
- Lobster Saffron
- Beef & Cheese
- Padron Peppers - i felt like it was a bit too salty (this coming from someone who LOVES salt!) Also, it's probably more ideal as a sampler dish for a large party. For my table of 2, I felt like I had enough after a few bites, and felt padron pepper'd out by the time we finished the plate :op
- Brava Potatoes - don't get me wrong, it was delicious. but as it's a pretty filling dish, i just felt that these were not out of this world, and I'd rather fill up on one of the many other tapas choices they have to offer

Overall, it was so delicious. Can't wait to head back here soon!! :oD

These two know what they are doing.  Superduper friendly and helpful, committed to transitioning habitual and chronic smokers to e-cigs.  They sell vapes and juices (70/30 pv) that are produced in Canada at reasonable prices, and their 'tasting bar' is a great idea (don't worry you get yer own disposable mouthpiece so its all hygienic) which allows you to sample out of the fifty some flavours they have.  The mint is boss - tastes just like a menthol.  

Prices are alright - there's tons of juice variety and more economical 'deals' to be had online for those willing to look, but meet and greet these guys and you'll want to give them your business - the customer service angle and genuine enthusiasm these guys give off is infectious and makes me want to support their growth.

Go and try it - the food is delicious, you won't be disappointed.  

That said - it's Banh Mi.  Go to any mom and pop Banh Mi shop in the city and the sandwich is $2-3 tax included.  Here it will set you back $8-10.  My 4 stars is for the pricing of what in Vietnam is a humbling and cost friendly experience of cross cultural fusion.  At BMB it's just a little too pretentious for my taste.  Everything is delicious, but you're paying for an environ designed to cater to the Western consumer.  I suppose you cannot blame them for their business sense, but it just rings off inauthentic. 

Amazing kimchi fries, even if it's a day's worth of calories in a bowl- you gotta get those.  Don't get it as a side on your own unless you are morbidly obese or like to throw away food.

Went to O.Noir using a Groupon recently.  Restaurant Groupons are something of a scam.  I get that I am supposed to tip on the full amount - I can do the math - the 'non-negotiable' automatic 15% tip on the total INCLUDING tax is ludicrous.  Given this was not disclosed in advance or on the Groupon, it's also not legal.  A gratuity is a gratuity, and I would have given my host Nasir a larger tip given the option to set my own bar.  Smart businesses know that customers are marketing vectors and correspondingly treat them well, even if they are there on a deal.  Unfortunately, O.Noir is pleased to rely on its position as a novelty experience rather than stand behind its food and service standards to drive more customers through the door.  Their prerogative I suppose, but it can't be good for repeat business.

I was also charged a random $15 dollar charge 'for using a Groupon' which was not stipulated anywhere on the deal.  This is truly what made me feel cheated and left a sour taste in my mouth.  My bill was identical to what it would have been without the deal = lame.  The wait to pay for said bill post-meal was crazy - they could use a more streamlined payment system (two operational tills would be nice).

The food itself was hit or miss - drink prices weren't outlandish, though considering you're apt to knock one over, this is a good thing.  I had the steak, which was great - my girlfriend had the shrimp/risotto, which was way oversalted and overdone to the point you could patch drywall with it.  The atmosphere is what you are here for, but even blind you can feel banquet style chairs and inordinately tight spacing with other couples/groups.  Your other senses heighten and you end up hearing a lot of other peoples' conversations very audibly, and I happened to be seated next to the most vapid and inanely redundant human beings in existence, rendering the experience even more unpleasant.  Guests in our room almost got in a blind fistfight over somebody using an indiglo watch for a second, which was entertaining in a Jerry Springerish sense.  

That second star is for the host Nasir - he's a righteous dude.  Too bad given my experience it's unlikely myself or anyone I recommend restaurants to won't get to experience his charm.

Had a new stereo installed in my Mazda Protege - $100 with all parts, brackets, connectors etc.  Not too shabby.  To my chagrin, Robby accidentally disconnected my heater when installing, so I called, brought it back in - he immediately got to fixing it and 5 minutes later my car was warm and toasty again, free of charge.  That's what service is all about.

Jan is cultivating a culture here.   Every vape shop has a tasting counter, but they are all about processing customers - try, buy, next.  Jan's definitely selling mods, coils, and juice, but EBV has perfected the chill lounge model.  It's like Cheers for Vapers, building a community of practice and appreciation for tobacco counterculture to such an extent that the 'store' concept feels decidedly anticapitalist. 

Which is why, perhaps, the Eastern Bloc brand is so apt.  At EBV you're not working with a disillusioned teenaged vaper getting paid minimum wage - you're working with a guru.  A vapor sommelier.  Somebody who is genuinely invested in your interest in vaping.  If you are looking for mod build tips, ideas, an incredible tasting bar with some of the best juices on the market (not just proprietary homebrew BS), or, most importantly, a place to just hang and vape with some great company you've never met before, Eastern Bloc is a must.  Go now.  Sit, vape, and be merry.

I love this place.  The birthday singing thing is kitsch, and pretty annoying because it happens so frequently (6 times my last visit), but the food at Pantheon is really good.  I have been twice and have not been disappointed.  The dips combo plate is amazing, though I would ask to switch out the Taramosalata if you don't like caviar, which is too fishy for my taste.  Their pita is fantastic, and their seafood is out of this world.  Saganaki amazing, horiatiki is not the best on the strip, but passable.  3 people ate and had an alcoholic bev for $90, and had leftovers for another meal.  If you're hunting for the most authentic Greek food on the Danforth, you could do a whole lot worse.

Great roti, albeit not the Caribbean kind; if that's what you're looking for go to Pat's.  Their day-old rotis are awesome value at 6.99 and weigh as much as a baby.

Service is always great and friendly.  Beware the spiciness of this place - people who cannot take spice should specify milder than mild and not get the day-olds as they are chaos spicy.

Thankfully, I like chaos.

This used to be the best gyro in town, and that includes the Danforth.  The portions were awesome, and the value to quality ratio was off the charts.  Clean stylish restaurant, and some really righteous patrons.  I'm talking almost once a week visits, sinking almost $500 into this place over three years.

...unfortunately there are new owners or something is going on as my last few visits I've observed a discernible downtrend in the portion sizes, and the prices have all been upped.  No longer can I get my 3 pc biftekia and chicken gyro with zucchini fries for $14 - it now comes out to over $20.  That's insane inflation for a standard pricehike and coupled with smaller portions does not make me a happy customer.  I had recruited a small army of people to repeatedly go here for Greek but will now need to find a new place that values the customer experience in true Greek fashion.

If you do go, by the love of all that is holy - get the zucchini fries.  They don't travel or keep well, but out of the fryer they are insane.  They, thankfully, haven't changed.

4.5 stars for a mechanic is unheard of.  People know nothing about cars and always feel hosed when they get the bill.

Well that's totally different than my experience at Cam's.  My story of why this place is the best is too long to post- suffice to say, they went above and beyond to save me money with my repairs.

These guys know their stuff, are crazy honest, and will always, always get my business.  I happily give out referrals to Cam's to any and all that need auto servicing.

I've been to this place twice, more than once was a mistake.  When they were a street operation, albeit a semi-legal one, it was really cool, novel - people would line up for days.  The tacos were $3 apiece, and it was a unique and fun experience. 

Ever since they got fixed locations though, I am very unimpressed.  I have slight hearing loss and the environment in this place is not conducive to any form of conversation - the music is all rap and hip hop and seriously and intensely loud.  I don't mind the style of music at all and am happy to eat tacos to A Tribe Called Quest, but at airplane-taking-off decibel levels? I was with a group and couldn't hear a word of what was being said, made me feel stupid and isolated.  Asking for music to be turned down was disregarded - 'this is our brand' was what I got in return.  Gross.  Service was slow and weirdly pretentious given the aesthetic they are trying to cultivate.

As per the tacos - overpriced and way small.  No lies, the cod fish is a decent two bites, but the carnita, cotija and beef cheek taste very boring - like more boring than ground beef with a 99 cent taco mix packet boring.  You could eat ten of them easily and still be hungry, which sets you back over $60 - the price/food ratio is rough and both times I left hungry, poorer, and disappointed.

The cherry on top is that this place is run by misogynists who think it is funny to make taco puns at the expense of women.  They have done this multiple times, and I am certain will continue to do so despite overtures to the public.  But hey, it's just locker room talk, right? 

On food quality, ambiance, and price, there are many, many better options for tacos in Toronto - I would skip this one.

I dig this place.  I had an issue with my handlebars sliding out all the time and brought it in for repair - the guys changed it out, but the problem persisted, so they replaced it again with a better quality part free of charge.  My bike felt unsafe and they made it a priority to keep me in one piece, for which I am thankful.  Great service, will use again.

I don't know who is eating here for $31-60, but the food is well and truly phenomenal and worth every penny.  The service is great, the cocktails are delicious, and the food - whoa.  The bream ceviche was mindblasting, and the octopus was out of this world awesome.  Really, really, really good.  I only went the one time so I'm not telling you you need to get those things, but you certainly won't be disappointed if you do.

Ambiance was okay - a predilection to play music a tad too loud like many restos catering to the young professional sensibility, which I don't get, but it seems the trendy thing to do.  Attracts annoying overpaid hipster patrons as well - the table next to us was a clamorous sea of forgettable vapid single women in their 30s that would repeatedly rupture into a crescendo of squeals: "this song is about me!" or "I know the chef, ladies I know the chef - WHY ISN'T ANYBODY LISTENING TO ME?" or "Tamara is a super betch" or new girl sits down at table, prompting sounds that could etch glass, despite it being said Tamara.  Etcetera.  If it wasn't for our neighbours, the entire experience would have been ethereally sublime.

We had the table closest to the door, it was winter, and it was crazy cold sitting there.  Don't sit there.  Still, despite being a complainer and loving all things complainy: 5 stars, hands down one of the more memorable culinary experiences I've had in the city.  Don't miss it, and book way in advance.

How has nobody else given Rose props for her amazing sandwiches?  My first time there she rather hilariously proclaimed her sandwiches would boost my libido and make me a virile sex machine.  The Banh Mi are delectable, massive, and cost $2 tax included.  TWO DOLLARS!  Where on earth do you find a deal like that in this day and age? $10 flat gets you 5 sandwiches, which will feed you for 3 days.

There are a gazillion reviews for Banh Mi Boys, with their inflated pricing and rather pretentious take on the venerable sandwich.  Their food is great, don't get me wrong - but there's no tradition, and you're feeding a hipster machine with good branding, location, and social media presence. It will also set you back $20 for one meal.  I urge you to save your money for Rose.

Rose does it right.

The buying experience was pleasant however I needed to return an item I was mildly pressured into buying.  I presented the item with my receipt however they sold me the item without a tag. The gentleman who was helping me was pleasant however he asked another salesperson for help. She would not look at or speak to me and was quite rude.  I was only able to get store credit and once I use that I will never set foot in a Lucky Brand again.

I'm giving this place 3 stars only because the wait staff was good. The food and value were very disappointing. I have frequented Texas de Brazil and gone to Fogo de Chau and this place comes in at the very bottom of the bunch. The salad bar has no labels on 80% of the items- so anyone with food alergies beware. Everything was overcooked (mushy or dry). The extra items you order for the table were no better. Greasy spinach. The fried bananas tasted like deep fried mystery items. And the meats. 2 standouts- beef ribs and Tritip. Everything else was bland or overcooked. And the meats didn't all come out unless requested- and seriously- who is requesting Chicken Hearts??? And at $100+ for two people, no value for the expense.

I wanted to like this place. It's Restaurant week in Vegas and I look for new places or hidden gems. What I found were streaky windows, no ambiance and no taste.  Ceasar salad was overdressed and warm. The calamari was overcooked and chewy. Steak and frites were cool not warm and just bland. The salmon was good flavor and temp but the sides a throw away. I poked fun at the dated plating style but that wasn't really bad. The chocolate soufflé was good texture but tasteless. The service asked how the entree was before either of us took a bite then only returned to clear. I debated a 3 rating but when you pay over $50 each for a dinner, I think it should be good- and this wasn't. Go follow DW to their new location at the Grammercy for flavor.

A friend and I started with the Burrata... Really great char on soft crusty bread with chimicurri, creamy Burrata cheese and tomatoes. Yummy. Next we split the kale and corn salad before splitting the fried chicken. The food was all yummy. Splitting the salad and entree was super smart. The portions are large. 
The waitress grabbed a seat with us to chat, checked in on us enough to be cared for and the perfect amount of leaving us to our  ourselves so we could talk. Loved it and will be back soon.

The service was ok. Just ok. The food was subpar. The 24oz bone in rib-eye has about 8-10 oz of actual meat. So fatty. Cook temp was ok. Barely seasoned. The vegetables were oily. The mashed potatoes were fluffy and buttery- so ok except too few of them. The chocolate cake tasted like it was defrosted from frozen. The ice team tasted like the 99 cents store brand. Very disappointed.

Not impressed at all. I paid 200 to go up and see the top of my house.  We traveled from Post and Ft Apache to Windmill and Durango.  I wish someone had warned me of where the flight would go. The pilot/owner spent 1/2 the time telling jokes, which was good. Unfortunately, the other 1/2 was spent bad mouthing the competitor.  That's not enjoyable.  And talk about HOT.  You need a hat... NEED!  They should set better expectations, an email covering what to bring doesn't cost anything and is just good customer service.  We almost landed on private property, the landing team had to help the basket get over gate.  There were 13 total on the trip including the pilot. It might be legal, but for a comfortable experience, it should be limited to 9. You get handed a disclosure on a lanyard which says tipping the pilot is customary.  umm its not customary to tip the owner.  Speaking of which, four of us on the ride were told that if they wanted an extra 30 minutes, they could pay an extra 50 in cash.  umm yet again. On the good side, you don't feel anything when up in the air. Also good, the pilot has a lot of flight experience and the crew is polite.

Just had the Kentucky Fried Fish. Wow. I've never ever had better. I am well traveled- 44 states and 14 countries. Again- never ever better. 

The fry was light but full coating. The fish was obviously fresh as it was glistening on the inside. The sauce flavorful and not spicy. The slaw was sweet and perfect balance. Portion is large. Price good. 

I'll be back. I'll bring friends.

My go-to place to take friends. The spinach salad is fabulous. The curries are super tasty. The Thai basil chicken is defaulted to hot, so make sure to give a rating on the spice level. The lava shrimp are a must have. They renovated and expanded a few months ago. Love this place!

The plumber and his work were fine.

The price, not so much. 

Cost of O Ring is 71 CENTS each. Cost to install on 3 toilets.. $345. 

Let's review. Materials cost is a total of $2.13. Time spent doing repairs -1hr. 

So I paid the plumber $342.87 for 1 hr of labor. 

I believe that will help you when you call and they "can't give you an estimate over the phone".

My stylist, Danielle, not only gave me a modern pixie- she taught me how to eliminate cow licks (sp?). She gave advice on the best products and hair dye solutions. I'll be back. I've been in Vegas 12 years and have finally found a stylist worth returning to. And the money? About $55 for a cut. Reasonable and excellence are a great combination.

First let me say the service was fantastic. Jason and Elsie both came to check on us multiple times. When are you ever at a restaurant and get checked on 4 times? Fabulous! The food was just like abuela's como siempre. This place always makes me feel closer to my grandmothers. Bacallito, Empanadillas, Maduras, Arroz con gandules, tembleque y flan. Yum!

The worse hair cut ever. Dirty shop. I never had a hair cut as bad as the one I had today.  I am not sure why some people gave it 4 or 5 stars unless they are friends.  I will never go back again

Best Middle Eastern food I've ever had outside of the Middle East.
 Amazing fresh ingredients, everything is made from scratch, and wonderful fast and friendly service.  
The first time I visited the place, I was greeted by one of the friendlies people. The man behind the counter was very friendly and chatty and gave me a piece of falafel to try out while I waited for mine to be cooked. I was very pleased - it was delicious. Crunchier and less greasy than any falafel I'd ever tried before, and much more flavorsome. To make conversation I mentioned how nice the baklava looked, and owner only went and gave me some to take with me as a little present! 
Because the food was so good, I ordered Shish Kefta, Grilled Chicken, and Kibbee to go 
The Shish Kefta was so good and melt-in-your-mouth tender, The Grilled Chicken was very juicy and full of flavor   and the Kibbee was crunchy and very tasty. 

I would definitely go back there if I am around Cleveland.

Casa Reynoso is consistently serving 5-Star quality traditional Mexican dishes with excellent service! My favorites are the Flour Cheese Crisp with Green Chile and Green Corn Tamales with a large order of rice!!!!! It's always a pleasant experience dining at this restaurant! Appreciating the great food and welcoming hospitality my overall rating for this establishment is 4.5 Stars, leaving them room for growth.

This place is gross. I've gotten up 3 times to get my own napkins, water,and ask for a menu. It feels like a bunch of kids who are annoyed you're here. Food....gross. drinks...Fine, I guess, but why not go somewhere else. I have a huge plate of nachos with barely any cheese, flies and bees flying around my table. Now all the waitresses are having drinks and laughing at the bar. Noone else is.

First of all, you don't want to sit at the bar because you're facing the back of the restaurant that looks like a clean but boring sports bar. If you look behind you at the rest of the restaurant, it's cute. Decor taking cues from the viceroy hotel for sure. Hipster black and yellow, life size horse lamp.
  I ordered a cocktail, the club soda was flat. I also ordered the Cobb salad. Errrrr, it's hard to mess up a cobb salad. I was excited to see "5 minute egg" as one of the ingredients as I love a beautiful yolk, but it came out on a square of iceberg lettuce. This is only okay if you've ordered a wedge salad and they disguise this cheap lettuce by drenching it in blue cheese. I cut into the egg... lovely. So, why is my salad sort of watery? Like maybe they rinsed the lettuce and didn't spin it? The whole thing has a slimy feel.  Plus an excessive amounts of pickled onions, which I'm a fan of generally. I'm about to order something else cause I can't choke this down....wish me luck. 
  Ordered the tartare. Interesting and pretty good. Pickled mushrooms and mushrooms crisps on top (yum) but half way through,  there was so much mustard, I got queesy.
  Staff was lovely, it was absolutely freezing, I left.

A tale of two locations (AKA: AVOID 7700 S Autoplex, GO TO 616 W Baseline)

First the good: 616 W Baseline

I have been a loyal repeat customer of Cobblestone Auto Spa ever since I encountered Jared, one of the managers at the 616 W Baseline. 

The first time I went there I had my car detailed for $150 after discounts. The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.

I am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.

COBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!

Now the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex

I first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.

I then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.

I then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.

When I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.

Finally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.

I went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.

The next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. 

I knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.

I suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.

As a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.

I went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. 

They reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.

Jared to the rescue:

I took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.

Lesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!

COBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF. GREAT MANAGERS MAKE FOR A GREAT STAFF.

Furniture was destroyed. A hole in the roof from rust let water almost everything was wet or moldy. They refuse to take any responsibility for it.Going ao far as to say the hile never existed and we must have drilled it just to get money from then. The man insists on yelling and interrupting. 

UPDATE:
upon returning to the unit to pick up the last of our items the owner began recording us taking photo's of the damage. When asked why he was recording us he jumped in his car and said he now 'understood our intentions' My Brother confronted him asking for the $110 reimbursement he had said he would deliver. The owner then declared he was going to call the police, we invited him to and encouraged him to.  Instead the owner barricaded himself in his office, locking the doors and setting the alarm. Upon leaving the facility he wanted us to sign a no-slander agreement. We declined. We did not receive the reimbursement.

I absolutely LOVE this shop! A lot of the Regal salons in Wal Mart really suck!! This one is Amazing! I usually have LeeLee do my hands and feet, but either of the 2 ladies are good. ( I'm very picky) their prices are good and their promptness is exceptional.( you can only do nails so fast before they start lookin crappy) they try to speak English most of the time, like they don't look at you then start talkin in their language! They make  sure "you like" if not "they fix for you", they are very sanitary, & professional. All in all, I love them, I only have to visit once every 3-4 weeks (thats how good their products Are) & if you're in the area, stop by, they won't keep you waiting & you won't leave with empty pockets or a sad face. Keep up the good work Regal Nails!

The service here, is sooo bad! We were meeting family, happened to be running behind them and when we got there they were eating already, it took the waiter 20 min just to come take our drink order, another 10 min to come with the drinks and take our order...thought we were good,WRONG! After 45 min. I asked about or food& by the time they came out, approx 5-8 min later, family started leaving, and we just began eating! I will never go there again! They were packed so I could understand a little delay, but come on! 45 min to receive a few of the simplest plates on the menu, um no.

I came here for Valentine's day and was seriously disappointed. Walking into the place, there was no host to greet or seat us. We had reservations and ended up walking around the empty tables looking for the one with our name on it. We finally chose a table and the food was pretty good, but my date asked for a steak knife to cut her lamb with, and our server said the place had no steak knives. Also our wine was served in tumbler glasses

I never thought that it was possible to have a life-changing experience at the hands of a single donut hole, but Pink Box donuts showed me what it meant to be happy again. Even after a weekend of partying in Las Vegas. A hole so sweet and flaky and perfect. A hole so inspiring that it made me question everything about myself. A hole that puts shame to all other holes. With every bite I was brought back to a simpler time when craftsmen had passion for their life's work. Cheers to you Pink Box donuts.

I've been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. The first time, I drove-through ordered the 4 for 4 meal, and the employee almost sent me home without giving me my drink. Not a big deal, but then when I got home I found that my 4 for 4 meal was a 3 for 4, as there was no burger in my bag. Went back today and again the drive through employee tried sending me of without my drink. When I asked for my sprite, I got an eye roll instead of an apology, and a cup full of carbon water.

The room is so HOT and there was no way to make it colder. We asked for a fan. It makes no difference. It just blows the hot air around. The staff needs to do something to make the rooms cooler before people check in. Miserable.

Wish I would have read the reviews before I took my hard drive in.  I had been emailing Tom at Friendly Computers and told him exactly what was wrong with my hard drive and what Geek Squad and other techs had told me (that it would have to go to a clean room in order to recover my data).  Being desperate because all of my 2 year old's baby pictures and videos are on that hard drive, Tom gave me hope (false hope) so I took it in to him.  He told me he was 60-70% confident that he would be able to retrieve my data.  I had to pay $169 flat rate fee and leave the hard drive with them possibly for a couple of week.  About 5 days later he calls me and he tells me that he can't get any of my data.   He offers to send it to their clean room lab for an evaluation but the $169 that I already paid them was not gonna be refunded to me.  I told him I paid $169 for nothing and he said well it wasn't for nothing because we've been working on it and trying.  This sounds to be like a great way to scam people.  Tell them you think you can help them and get them to pay the $169 all the while knowing that you can't get any of that data but you sure got their money.  Wonder how many others are out there that have been thru the same situation.  Also, I have read this sales agreement/receipt 3 times and don't see where it says the fee is non refundable even if they can't retrieve your data.  Maybe I'm overlooking it but I don't see it.  DO NOT GO TO FRIENDLY COMPUTERS.  They are not "friendly".  They are major con artists, scammers, liars, etc.  Don't waste your time or money and don't get your hopes up.  I got my hard drive back from him minus my $169 that was wasted down the drain and he probably erased all my data so that no one else would be able to recover it since I refused to let him send it to his lab.  I will never be able to recover those videos now of my toddlers first roll over, first crawl, first word, first steps, etc..  This is definitely not how I treat people and certainly don't want to be treated this way by others, especially businesses in my own community.  WOW!!!!

I tried Fox car rental in late August. They were one of the cheapest and affordable in the area. The only reviews I read said they were slow. I had time so we decided to try them. They were okay at the first counter.  Set us up with a car, and sent us down to the garage to get our car.  This was not easy to find and no signs to there counter in the garage.  Another rental place had to show us where they were.  When we got over there, they were slow. They handed me keys and said here is your car go find it. If there is a problem with it let us know. We found the car? It had many dings and scratches down both sides. We stopped to report those, and the agent acted like we were wasting her time. I had to point out all the damage, as we walked around there we dings in the front and back too. We thought we were okay, the car ran fine the week we used it. When we returned it they tried to blame the dings and scratches on us! We said no way! They found the report where we reported the damage before we left. They then said okay.  We signed tge final paperwork and left. But a month later they are trying to say we did the damage and charge us 1000.00! I am fighting it, but my insurance company told me this is not uncommon!  Its is so wrong! If my insurance company steps in they saif they can get it lowered most likely,  its hard to prove or investagate. I would still have to pay my debatable. . It has been a horrible experience.  We never use them again!

Went there with some coworkers unplanned and based solely on Yelp recommendations. Everything was great! The staff was helpful and accommodating. The owner was very friendly and hands on. The hookah was very nice, Turkish coffee was fantastic and we tried uma Ali for the first time ( I don't know how to spell it, but that was how it sounded to me)... great! There is no alcohol there so if you cannot live without it go to a bar, but you'll be missing out. If instead you like great, friendly service in a warm inviting environment then this is where you belong.

This place....lol our server was nice.  But for 50 something dollars for dinner was not worth it....Sorry but if I could choose another place to spend that much I know I would have been much happier. Not to mention they took a photo of us when we came in then brought us like 3-4 printouts of them, I mean nice ones...then they told us it was 15 dollars for one of the pictures...we honestly thought out of all the money we spent we'd at least get the pics for "free."  So they went through all the trouble to print them and then are going to throw them away because we didn't want to pay for them? Why not just give us the photos...Food was cold, poor quality of meats, etc..Also not near as big as this looks! Just bummed we spent so much. 
Sorry can't recommend this at all.

Five stars are for my hair stylist Brice Bensimon. I haven't been yet at Cristope Salon, but i have seen Brice a couple of times and he is simply amazing. All knowledgeable and very helpful. He is a good listener, gives proper advise , and puts time end effort into making your hair great.( he is also charming and fun to talk to) My hair never looked so good before!  I highly recommend him.

When you pay extra for a room at a 4-star hotel, you have an expectation that you will be getting a pretty nice room. That was not the case here.  I would say that our room was a step up from the Motel 6 down the street. 

We were placed in one of the Bungalow rooms, which is essentially, the older section of rooms.  It has three floors with one side facing the pool and the other facing a loading dock and the Tropicana roof.  If you are lucking enough like us on our anniversary, there will also be a roof access door that is cracked open about 20 feet from your window so any Tropicana employees that happen to walk through that door will have a clear view into the room.  No luck in switching rooms either.

The carpet, furniture, and mustard yellow wall paper made it feel dated, along with the cracks in the ceiling.  The only updates in the room that I could tell was a 42-inch flatscreen TV and the shower.  

The lobby looks nice and updated, but the casino itself is pretty small.  We ended up spending most our time elsewhere.  Pool look decent, but was crowded.  Half of the area was empty as it was reserved for 'special' guests.  

If I were to do it all over again, I would have saved the extra cash spent on this supposed 4-star hotel and booked at one of the other 3 star casinos nearby that have better rooms, bigger casinos, and better location.

Love Drip. I've been coming here for a few years now, and Gina and Vene always make my daughter and I feel right at home. And where else can you be guaranteed to see the mayor of phoenix sipping a cuppa joe.
 I love the food, especially the NY egg sandwich, and the homemade goodies that are usually on display. And the coffee is excellent, always nice and strong. However, they do make everything to order, so allow some time during busy hours (lunch, etc).
 They have free wi fi, and well placed outlets, most of them are quad boxes, so you will have place to plug in.
 And I have yet to hear a bad song, so overall, I would recommend it to anyone.

We've had Screenmobile of Charlotte help us with two different projects - one was a retractable screen for sliding french doors and the other was a removable safety fence around our pool.  Everyone who works for this company is so very helpful and puts customer satisfaction as their primary goal.  I highly recommend Dave and his team (including Debbie in the the office) if you have any screening needs.

I used to tan with Donna when I lived in Vegas. I have a spray tan business myself, but it's extremely difficult to spray yourself as you can imagine. With that being said, I am very picky and Donna does an amazing job! Her prices are inexpensive and even if it was last minute she was able to accommodate me! If I'm ever in Vegas and need a tan she is my girl!

We've went through various daycares in the area before signing up with Kids&Company.  I even dropped by few times to make sure what I saw during our tour was what you'd actually get.  The site is very well maintained and extremely clean.  

The meals and snacks are carefully planned by a nutritionists who incorporate diverse menu (fish, tofu, various ethnic menus like pad thai) that incorporates seasonal veggies and fruits.  

I cannot say enough about the staff though - they truly love what they do and it shows.  From the day we started transitioning my little one at 12 months, all the teachers have shown nothing but love and care.  They make sure each child is engaged and cared for and I am always grateful for all the work that they do with the children.  

The webcam access to the room is also a bonus (it came really handy during the first few weeks when it was just as much of a transition period for me as it was for my child - I may have spent a good chunk of my day watching/weeping/laughing).

Another added bonus is how responsive the head-office is to suggestions.  Parents are encouraged to give feedback and suggestions and they are very responsive to parents' inputs.  The weekly newsletter also allows us to know what my little one has been learning so that we can reinforce some of the things at home (ex. songs or books that they have been learning).

Kids and Company really is as good as it gets in terms of daycare :)

We've visited The Black Hoof (one of the few restaurants Gordon Ramsay visited when he was in Toronto) numerous times and attended various culinary events with Grant van Gameren, so we were really excited to visit Bar Isabel.

If you have been to The Black Hoof, the menu will look extremely familiar -- don't get me wrong, the food is tasty and good (ex. tongue with broche, horse tartar) but there really isn't much new if you have been to his other restaurants.

The bartender took forever to get my drink made -- he kept looking back to the menu to figure out the ingredients were.  Also, I'm not sure if we just had a new waitress or just not the friendly ones other reviewers have said but our waitress told different tables different list of the night's special.  For example, when we asked about what fish they were using for the ceviche, she told us that they were only serving sea bream -- then told the other table that they had the option between sea bream or red snapper.  

For every table she went to, she'd ask if they wanted to order anything else, then if the customers said 'no', she'd roll her eyes as she walked away.  Other wait staff re-filled our water, never her.  Our plates were also taken away before we finished our food.

It is nice that Bar Isabel takes reservations, accepts credit cards, and has more space/seating (unlike The Black Hoof).

We've shared the mixed combo platter between 4 people and we did not leave the place hungry ;)  Darn those attentive servers who periodically come with steamy pillowy bread...

The falafel was a little bit denser than what I'm used to but still good.

Still dreaming of the fries with garlic sauce and fattoush salad!

We decided to drop in after this restaurant was recommended to my dad by a friend. The place is moderately spacious but really homey - great for families. We ordered two gyros and the chicken souvlaki to go. The souvlaki was delicious, as were the fries on the side. My dad, a born-and-raised Greek, said the gyro was fantastic. The owners were so kind and welcoming, really wonderful people. To top it all off, we got a pretty hefty amount of food for a great price.  Highly recommended!

I have been coming here for a few years now and the service has steadily gotten worst. One server, who has been there as long as I've been going, Jesse i think his name is, hit on me and my friend, asking if we wanted to hang out later, even asked for our phone number.... I go here to eat, not to get hit on and made to feel like I need to leave because of some thirsty boy. Last time I was there, the girl who served me was very nice but never came to check how the food was and she never refilled my drink. I love the food here but if this type of service continues I will definitely be looking for another place of business to support.

5 stars for the food- i truly love the food here, everything is delicious and the margaritas are too good to not get 
5 stars for the service- any and every server I have had has exceeded my expectations! wonderful people!
There is one bartender there, I cant remember his name, he is maybe in his 30's, definitely heavier set guy, mexican and i think he wears glasses; I don't enjoy being served by him, I've overheard some sexually inappropriate comments coming from him concerning other paying customers in the restaurant. I find this highly offense and unprofessional, it makes me extremely uncomfortable and I also wonder what comments he has made about my body sexually.
All of the hostesses there are nice, friendly and full of smiles, except one, I dont know her name either. She is mexican, and last time I was in there she was handing out food, which was new, considering she is the girl who never smiles and makes it seem like it's a painful task to seat me. She always glares at me, never smiles, sighs when I let her know how many people are in my party and lazily walks us to our table. However, every other hostess I have ever come across here is all smiles, courteous and just as friendly as the servers.

A couple bad apples can surely affect business, I know I avoid going to this establishment on certain days due to those specific employees. I have even mentioned something to the General Manager who simply replied, "That is just who they are.", with a smile on her face, like it wasn't a big deal and walked away. I was highly shocked, but with her attitude and lack of concern for the company, explains why those couple people act the way they do.

Love going here! My last two visits were decent. The server honestly, was rude, I do not remember her name; but seriously, every other time I have been here EVERYONE is so nice. Also, the potatoes seem to be slightly undercooked, again this is a more recent thing happening here, I am guessing there is a newer cook. The biscuits and gravy, Cajun omelet and the coffee are to die for!! Definitely somewhere you should try at least once, anyone I have every taken here has become a huge fan and always comes back

My meal was so terrible that I am writing this review instead of eating my food. I wish I could tell somebody but I haven't seen a server since one dropped off the food and left. This is literally the worst meal I've had in Calgary. Do not come here.

I came back to edit this review because I can't get over how bad this meal was. The kimchi was terrible, the bulgogi tasted like nothing. The best part of the meal was the hot sauce that I used to provide some semblance of flavour.

First let me start by saying that I have NEVER in my life written a bad review, but was shocked by how incredibly rude and borderline abusive the female groomer Dana was!!!! I made an appointment a week ahead of schedule only to receive a call from Dana a few hours prior to my appt asking me to reschedule because she had overbooked herself. I let her know that I would not be able to do so, and she openly, and loudly, sighed over the phone about my not being able to change to another date and time. When my fiancee went to drop off the dog, and was 10 mins late so refused to take the dog at all! I was confused and called to ask why she wouldn't take my dog and she said it was because my fiancee was 15 mins late and that "she can't help other people's mistakes". If you do not have a 15 min window as a groomer then obviously you are doing a shoddy job and rushing. I explained to her that I was a little taken back by her attitude to which she hung up on me! DO NOT take your dog here, she is a nasty person with a nasty attitude!

The pizza was good and I love the concept of making your own, however this location was filthy and service not so great.  It's a Saturday night and pretty dead compared to other places in the area.  There's 7 employees working and all of them are standing behind the counter not working. What's annoying is that there's not a clean table in the whole place, food all over the floor, etc.  One employee is on his phone texting and one is at the register dancing. What the hell? 

It doesn't look like there's a manager on shift. What's sad is that they have a sign saying they're hiring, yet clearly over staffed with kids that aren't working.  I don't know that we'll go back.  If the place is that poorly run and dirty in the dining area, hate to know what's going on in the kitchen.

We had used Nyah's a couple of times to groom our 3 little dogs.  My initial impression was great because they seemed to be so kind and caring towards our kiddos.  However, from a business perspective they are terrible.  They are very difficult to get a hold of, whether if it's to make an appointment or ask a question.  We had an appointment and when I called earlier in the week to confirm the time, I did not get a response.  The morning of the appointment I reached out again to ask how much time they'd need for our dogs because we had a potential conflict and had to leave the house 3 hours out from what I was guessing was our scheduled time.  I thought maybe we could do 2 of 3 dogs, but wasn't sure if we could get all 3 done.   When I did get a response back, it was a text saying they were cancelling our appointment entirely.  No call to answer my initial question of how long they'd need or a discussion to figure out an alternative solution (I could have easily had my mother come to the house).  Then Mitch went on to say that they might not be the best service for us because they prefer customers that have recurring appointments and they were raising prices.  A...they never discussed a desire to have recurring appointments, which we'd be happy to do if we were aware it's a requirement and B...there had been no discussion about a change in pricing.  Instead they cancelled on us within hours of our appointment and implied I was lucky they weren't going to charge me a cancellation fee.  Then I find out they decided to groom other dogs that were in the neighboring house they were at that morning. This was ridiculous.  Clearly it was more convenient for them to take this other client and cancel on us, but this is poor business.  It has taken us weeks to get scheduled with another mobile groomer to take care of our dogs (which I have found to be much more professional).  I would not recommend this service due to poor communication and business practices.

I called and talked to somebody about ordering a cake for my dogs birthday.  They said, "No problem, we will have it ready for you today."  Now, a typical person would believe that to mean you will have your cake ready for you when you go to pick it up.  So, I leave work to go pick it up and this is not even close to me.  I get there and the doors are locked.  I look around and see a post it note on the door saying, "Sorry cake guy, hospital issues."  I understand that things happen, but at least give me a call and at the very least, use my name!  Luckily, Boneappetit in Ahwatukee was able to accomadate me with a couple of pupcakes in a pinch.  My point: I never even got to check out their store or products, but I would never go back because of the terrible customer service I received.

Nando's has some really good dishes and an atmosphere that is not typical of East Mesa........it's actually fun.  The number one item on the menu is the Pollo Rico.  I won't describe it, just order it.  It's delicious.  Gets a little crowded at the bar early with the old Las Sendas people that, for some strange reason, think they are the true upper crust of America, but push them out of the way and find a seat at the bar, where you will get good service.

I think I have eaten here a dozen or so times.  You think you can't get good seafood in Arizona, you're wrong.  This restaurant is amazing!  Their seafood is always fresh and tasty, the bread you get before your dinner is spectacular, the service is some of the best I've ever had, I can't say enough good things about this place.  Yes, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for.  If you don't normally go to nice dinners but have a special occasion, try the Salt Cellar.  Like I said, I have been there about a dozen times and I have never had a bad experience.

If you want your child to sit in a bouncer or crib and cry all day unattended, take them here.  They care about your money; they make that very apparent.  They do not care about the well being of your child.  I can speak from experience.  Do your child a favor; find a place that is not so sterile and unaccomodating.  Like I said, their only concern is your money.  They do not provide anything other than a place to store your child when you have to work.

I just bought my 3rd and 4th bikes from Tempe Bicycle last weekend.  I have never had any complaints, unlike most of the reviewers here!  I got my new MTB for about $500 less than I have seen elsewhere and my wife's road bike for about $200 less.  Overall, this was another plesant experience purchasing bikes.  Yes, the bikes are expensive.  Bikes are expensive everywhere!  They are no more expensive here than any other bike shop in town; usually cheaper.   I have also had great customer service here every time I have been in.  I definitely reccomend.

Let's just say this, if you are white trash, you will love this place.  You truly will fit in perfectly, since that is all that frequents this fine establishment.  Their food is not fit for humans, their service is very sub par, their clientelle is, as I've already stated, rather Apache Junction-like and the atmosphere is just depressing.  So come on down and make sure to wear your finest Metal Mullisha T-shirt and bring multiple packs of cigarettes to enjoy on their smoke filled patio, with the rest of the toothless patrons.

They do a pretty good job washing my cars.  I go here a few times a month and have had very few negative experiences.  Their oil and lube department is pretty bad though.  Do yourself a favor and skip the extremely overpriced oil change.  Go get it done at a reputable dealer or local garage for half the price.  I had back to back oil changes there once.  The first time they said my air filter needed to be replaced, so I did the lazy thing and had them replace it.  I came back 5,000 miles later and they said my air filter needed to be replaced again........really?  They will reccomend services you don't need.  Come here for a carwash only.

Financing department and service department are the two most dishonest and disappointing departments ever.  Here's the story...........  I bought a 2009 Maxima from them in December.  I got what I wanted, traded my truck that was falling apart for a newer, nicer used car from Horne Kia.  I went in there with a loan from my bank already approved so I didn't need their financing.  I went in there with the loan approval number and was happy when they told me everything was good and they would get the information about my new car to the bank so they could complete the loan.  They didn't.  They opened a new loan with my bank so that they could make some money off the new loan that they started.  Now, this normally wouldn't be that big of a deal, aside from it causing my credit to be run again, but they lied about it to me, which is unacceptable.

So, with the purchase of my new, used car, I get a free oil change when it's due.  This brings me to this last Saturday, when I brought it in for it's first oil change.  I made an appointment for 9:30AM on Saturday to do a basic oil change.  My wife and I drop it off and they tell us it will take and hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes.  No problem since they seemed rather busy, we'll go get some breakfast.  So it's after 12:30 and still no call, I figure they may have forgotten to call us and we just head back there since it's been three hours.  Much our dismay, we get there and it's still in the same spot it was in when we left.  I go into the office, which is now virtually empty, and speak with the service advisor I dealt with earlier.  He tells me that they had to go get an oil filter from a parts store since it was a Nissan they were working on and they were a Kia dealership.  Well, that makes sense if I hadn't made an appointment 8 days earlier and they weren't expecting me.  But here's the real kicker; a 2009 Maxima takes the exact same oil filter as virtually every Kia from 2008 and before, as well as some 2010 Kia's.

Apparently this service advisor thought I wouldn't know this, as most people wouldn't, I'm sure.  When I asked him again what part it was they had to go get from a parts store, giving him the chance to be honest with me, he lied again.  Therefore, I presented him with this information and he instantly turned quite sheepish, not knowing what to say.  I proceeded to tell him that all we wanted was some honesty and they obviously don't deliver that at this dealership.  My wife and I walked away and he had nothing to say.

Case and point: NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE.

I love this restaurant.  If you are looking for good Italian food in the East Valley, you must travel to Baci.  Their pasta portions are huge and delicious, the bread they serve before the meal is great as well.  I must reccomend the cannolis, as they are to die for.  I'm not sure why people have said it is expensive, because it's really not.  Maybe they thought they were at Olive Garden and were expecting unlimited salad and pasta, who knows.  But hands down, the best Italian food in the East Valley.

The absolute worst care ever.  They care about one thing and one thing only, taking your money.  The ladies at the front are extremely unprofessional and could not care less if your health is taken care of.  I am a patient of Dr. Rudgear for the last 7 years, although I've never met her.  I see Melissa Prince who will not give me the medically necessary care.  I am absolutely appalled by this place, as is the rest of the Yelp community apparently.  I will never go back here and you should AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

These guys are honest, have unbeatable prices and fix the problem right the first time.

I've been taking my two cars and our work trucks here for a couple years now.  I have no complaints.  If something doesn't need to be fixed, they won't try to tell you it does to make more money.  Fast, reliable service.

The Golden Gate sandwich.  What more can I say?  I have dreams about it.......good ones.  Pastrami, bacon, swiss cheese and 1000 island dressing on a tasty sub roll and then baked.  This is my favorite sandwich in the valley.  Pair it with the homemade chips and bbq sauce and you are sure to be happy.

The place is really nice too.  Great selection of wine!

I have been here four or five times and each time it gets a little worse.  Not the worst cafe I have been to, just nothing special.  Their sandwiches are small and the bread is not good.  The cookies are about the only thing worth going back for.

This dealership sucks... Nick Taylor told us we were pre approved had a bank and everything and come down to sign papers and we would have a car. so we did that and had the car for a week ad five days they calls us to tell us we need to return it because they dont have a bank to finance us. So we were told one thing and they did another and act like oh well ooopppsss sorry. Dont go there to get a car they do not follow through with what they tell you... they give salesman a bad name. Now that he isnt getting a sale he will not return phone calls.

We had the pleasure of dealing with Brandon during our wedding at the Cosmopolitan on Aug 4, 2015 and he is without a doubt the best photographer I've ever dealt with in the 8 wedding parties I've been a part of.  

You know a good photographer that is selective with his shots and is confident that he has it right the first time.  I was amazed at how few shots he seemed to take, yet on receiving all our photos, we had about 300 and he nailed them all.

The turnaround was also amazing, we had our wedding on a Tuesday and had all the high res, edited shots in our hands by Friday.  He is great with lighting on the shots, and creates very interesting angles, at no point was the flash ever attached to his camera and placed in some corner of the room creating a great atmosphere to his photos.

He's great at making people feel comfortable, capturing candid moments and making it not feel like a chore.  To put it simply, I could not recommend him any higher, he is incredible at what he does and we couldn't be happier with the photos he produced.  

Most people come away from their wedding with 5 or 6 favourite photos, we have the tough decision of narrowing 30 or 40 down to 4 or 5 to hang on the wall at home.

This is by far the best dentist I have ever been to!! I walked in for my apointment and was seen right away. The teeth cleaning was painless but thorough. The chairs are very comfortable and they have a personal TV for you to watch with Netflix. After visiting a different dentist I was told I needed a crown, and it would require two separate visits. I came here and they made my crown for me and put it on in no time at all! I highly recommend checking this place out if you haven't already.

Wanted to go here during our trip to Vegas this Christmas. Confirmed by email that they would be giving rides around Christmas. Then bought the Living Social, filled out the booking request form on their website, then ... NOTHING! No confirmation. After several unanswered emails, I called Living Social for a refund. Turns out, the business had already marked my voucher as 'redeemed' even though I have not yet been to Las Vegas. Note: it is their policy to NOT answer phone calls/return messages. In my case, apparently, it's their policy to not respond to emails either.

I love love Cuban food so I was thrilled that there was a place so close to me.  Unfortunately, this place was a big letdown.  I've gotten food here twice and both times were mediocre at best.  I ordered the cuban sandwich the first time and the fillings looked as though they were just thrown in.  And they forgot my fries and when I asked for them, I got a side of cold, limp ones.  Next time, I got the lechon asado and it was really fatty (I know this isn't a lo-cal dish, but there was almost more fat than meat), the sauce was really bland (couldn't even taste the bitter/sour orange) and the onions were cooked until they were mushy.  Also, the servers weren't very friendly during either visit (big negative for me).

This is very sad since I was really hoping for the best for Havana Grill.

I've been lurking on yelp for awhile now, just reading reviews, getting suggestions, etc.  But after trying true island bbq today, I decided to man up (woman up?...whatever, you get the gist) and start posting.  Why? Because this place is ridiculously good!  Like others have said, Darrell is fantastic.  Very friendly and quick with the suggestions :)  I had the shish kabobs with red rice (8.75), and it was worth every penny.  Darrell was nice enough to put the hot sauce and salad dressing on the side for me (I didn't even have to ask) since I got my order to go and that hot sauce!!  Tart, garlicky, spicy...amazing.  Everything was super fresh and delicious!  So hurry up, don't just meander along, and get yourselves over there.  If not, I'll prob. end up eating everything before you get there.

Definitely not authentic, but nonetheless the food is awesome.  I've been here twice over the past two weeks and I'm a huge fan.  First, the drinks are great.  Margaritas: I've had the traditional and strawberry and both are excellent.  They also have a good variety of beer on tap.

Portions here are pretty big so come hungry.  The carnitas and roasted chicken are juicy and come with great sides.  Good salsa and guacamole as well.

And I've found the service to be great on both occasions I've visited the restaurant.  Prompt attention but not so much that it becomes hovering.  Plus the place has a beautiful bar area that's great for a relaxed dinner.

Very friendly owners/servers and decent food.  A mostly Korean menu with some Hawaiian BBQ, burgers, etc. added on.  The food is fresh and hot but not the best in terms of flavor (maybe not enough seasonings?).  (Pass on the fries.  Bibimbap and volcano pork are quite good.)  But as service counts for a lot in this girl's book, I'll stick to my 4 stars.

Very, very nice and customer friendly owners gets this place 3 stars, but on food alone I give it 1.5 stars.  Though it's nice to have a Korean place so close by, Jun's House food isn't what real Korean food should taste like.  First, shitake mushrooms should be reserved for just a few dishes since they're so pungent.  However, Jun's seems to place it in many dishes (including the yuk-hae-jang, or beef and veggie soup) which is a big big BIG mistake.  Instead of a spicy, savory soup, all you taste is shitake mushrooms.  The banchan (side dishes) are subpar as well, esp. the kimchi (bland and sad).  And don't get me started on the kimchi soup.  Using "raw" kimchi in kimchi soup is unheard of...I had no idea why it was so strangely sweet until I called my mother to ask.  And lettuce in the bibimbap?  Just weird.  But the BBQ is decent so if that's what you're looking for, Jun's shouldn't disappoint.  Jun's food made me grumpy and now I'm grumpier because I'm posting my first negative review.  Thanks a lot, Jun's house.

Wow, I'm surprised with most of the reviews here because I am in love with this restaurant.  I've been here a good dozen times since it opened and can't get enough.

Start with the grilled artichoke appetizer.  The chef takes a whole (giant) artichoke, removes the choke, steams it until almost done and then finishes it off on the grill.  The artichoke comes out sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and with a mustardy dip on the side.  Amazing.

Also, the salads are delicious.  My personal favorite is the seared ahi tuna salad.  It comes with a great champagne dressing and a huge serving of sesame encrusted seared tuna.  So good.  The steak cobb salad is also really good with melt in your mouth croutons, avocado and a great dressing.

I've always had great service here and the food is consistently great.

It's great that Thai House is so close to my house because I have some major Thai cravings.  That being said, I've found this place very hit or miss.

Hits: fresh veggie springrolls, red curry, pad thai, chicken wings.

Misses: the soups (I've tried at least 5, and to me they all lack flavor), fried rice, roasted duck.

Also, the staff isn't the friendliest.  Even when there aren't many people in the restaurant.  Not rude, per se, just not very welcoming.  And if you come during dinner, expect a considerable wait until you get your food.

Cupcakes!!  Who doesn't love cute little "all for me" morsels of cake?  This store is adorable and the delicious smells waft all the way to the parking lot.  The cupcakes themselves are gorgeous (slight concern though: is it safe to eat glitter???).  And they're delicious to boot!  My favorite is the mounds of joy (coconut cupcake - no flakes, just yummy coconut smell and taste, dark chocolate frosting and coconut flakes on top).  The ganache and carrot cake are fantastic as well.  I actually didn't like the red velvet so much...it was really dry and the frosting was too gloppy for my taste, but everyone else seems to rave about them so maybe I just got a bad batch.  Warning, once you have one, it'll be really hard to stay away!

Like Monica, I never had the chance, prior to moving to LV, of trying Brooklyn Bagels, and I have to say that I was a bit disappointed.  I've been to this location many times because it's so close to where I live.  And I agree that the employees are always very cheery (even early in the morning) and eager to help.  My problem is that the bagels I've purchased have been very hit or miss.  Sometimes they're fantastic, crisp on the outside and pillowy on the inside...other times, they're hard (stale-like) and really dry and crumbly on the inside.  It's hard to rate this place higher than 3 stars when half the time I can only eat half the bagel before my jaw gets tired of chewing and chewing the rawhide-like bagel "crusts".  It doesn't mean I won't still go here once in a while, but it's always a crapshoot (sooo apropos in Vegas ;)).

One big plus: the coffee is always fantastic.  Much better than the starbucks next door.

Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  I've been there 5 times now and have left completely satisfied each time.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and has indoor and outdoor seating as well as an indoor and outdoor bar.  Since Brio doesn't take reservations, you'll often have to wait a good 30-45 minutes which is plenty of time to get yourself is peach bellini (yes, it's girly and frothy) which is wonderfully refreshing and not too sweet.  The waiters are all very attentive, even when the place is slammed, which is a nice change from the LV norm.  

Food wise: the bread you're served upon seating is piping hot and delicious; the lobster bisque is amazing; the brio chopped salad is great (but I recommend getting the balsamic dressing over the red wine); caprese bruschetta is delicious, as is the roasted red pepper brushetta (blanking on the name); and those mini desserts (creme brulee especially) are the perfect endings to a great meal.

Incredible burgers!  LBS is located inside the Red Rock Casino and features all organic ingredients (even the ketchup is organic!).  It makes everything, including buns, patties, pickles, and fries, in house.  The buns are soft and so fresh.  The burgers are juicy and cooked perfectly.  The fries, that come with a special fry sauce, are crisp and delicious.

LBS is great because it provides great choices to customize your burgers.  The LBS burger sauce is just slightly sweet (akin to a steak sauce) which some of you may not like.  But you have a variety of sauces you can substitute on your burger, including a horseradish one.  Yum!  There are also varieties of cheeses and toppings that ensures everyone will leave happy.  Definitely the best burger I've had in Vegas.

Wow, I couldn't have had a more different experience from Cindy's.  First fyi: the company charges 80 dollars an hour (for two movers).  There is a minimum 2 hour block to use the services.  And there is a one hour "driving" fee of 80 dollars to initially get to your place.  So, the very minimum the service will cost is 240 dollars.  Seemed pretty reasonable.

I hired All My Sons to move the furniture from a one bedroom apartment to a different unit in the same complex.  The new apartment was about 100 ft away from the first so there was no real "driving time" involved during the actual move.  All I really needed moved was a dining table, desk, bed, dresser, small file cabinet, and nightstand.  Shouldn't take more than 2 hours, right?  Wrong.  The workers moved slower than tar and continually used my bathroom and drank all my bottled water.  4 hours later, I just asked them to stop and said that I would pay what I owed.  Over 500 dollars later, I was still left with a ton of stuff to move on my own.  Also, they taped shut my dresser drawers and file cabinet doors with a tape they assured me would not damage the paint.  And when I started peeling the tape away, half of the paint came off with it.  They do not take of belongings and they scratched up the entire surface of my 1 month old white desk to the point I had to paint the entire thing over in a dark color.

If you're in need of trustworthy movers, try to use bekins or another more well established company.  You'll be much better off paying the slightly higher hourly rates for workers who actually work and don't damage your belongings.

Not my cup of tea. Although from many other reviews people seem to like this place. I'm not saying it's bad but I am very particular with my hot pots and like to have a garlic sauce similar to boiling points condiments. 
This place does serve good food and looks delicious but I am a sauce person and similar to my joy pot I like popcorn chicken with sweet and sour or spicy sauce. Something along the lines with a flavorful taste so I don't just taste the fried chicken breast. 
It may be due to the many Asian fusion places in my area. Living in SGV (San Gabriel Valley), which leaves me to make a drastic opinion based on things that others may not even care for. But overall presentation and quality is pretty good but I would not come back.

Pro tip: be prepared to wait. The restaurant is located near the entrance of the Planet Hollywood Casino. I went for dinner at around 6 and was seated at about 7:30 pm, BE PREPARED TO WAIT! Especially for dinner, I had a party of 3. If it's just a couple they will most likely have you wait in line in front of the restaurant. The hostess were very snotty and I was not told any party that's isn't for two must check in with the hostess and they will text you when your table is ready. I waited for about 20 mins before a hostess came to get information for each couple. At that point I was told to give them my information. There was a huge misunderstanding. Be various of the line, it is best to check in with the hostess first.

Once we were seated, I started off with the sweet potato fries which where delicious. The food overall was probably one of the best gourmet burgers I had. Although I am not a huge fan of over easy egg, the duck bacon was spot on and the combination of both gave it a great pazzaz.

Overall the is a must if your in Vegas. Defiantly worth the wait, it may be pricey for what you are getting but the burger was a mouthful. I would recommend to be spontaneous in what you order because Gordon Ramsey special designed each dish. A job well done!

I went here a few weeks ago because of all the reviews raving about it, and because it's just down the street from me. Overall the service was alright. I walked in and ordered my food at the counter. (I got a Ruben with their house-made chips) The cashier told me I could take a seat wherever and that my food would be out soon. After around 5-7 minutes they brought out my sandwich. 

The sandwich wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either. Honestly, I just felt like a regular sandwich, which is fine in my book. Their homemade chips are pretty decent too. 

All in all, the restaurant really isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about either. If you're out and just want a quick bite to eat that's close by, this place is a viable option.

This place is great, the owner is very kind, and the food is great. They honestly do their food better than a lot of places in china town. The second I walked in, the smell of the bakery had me hooked. The food takes a little on the long side to come out, but the service is good enough to make up for it.

Their menu features a wide variety of dishes - mostly typical Korean fare. However, people usually go for their cold noodles. They also feature an extensive list of Sundae ("soon-deh") dishes, which is Korean sausage made with pig organs and intestines. Observing the other tables, I noted that it wasn't as popular as Naeng Myeon. However, keep in mind that it was a hot summer evening and the cold noodles are just that good. I personally like Sundae (spelling it like that is making me want ice cream...argh. I better switch to Soondae), and encourage you to try it!

Chik Bibim Naeng Myeon (Thin arrowroot noodles with a special sauce)
Win!
This was perfect for the hot day. The slushy broth, cooling veggies, chilled arrowroot noodles, and sliced hard-boiled egg made this the most satisfying bowl of noodles that I've had in Toronto. I chowed until all that was left was a puddle of the "special spicy sauce" which I loved. From what I observed, it's essentially hot pepper paste (gochu-jang), hot pepper flakes, and probably a bit of soy & minced garlic.
The slurried broth kept the dish chilled while I ate through my mother's plate of Tang Soo Yuk. My father and I shared dumplings & short ribs.
Anyways, I can quite honestly say that this was the best bowl of cold noodles that I've had to date, rivalling South Korea. While it may seem backwards to eat spicy food when it's hot, it was super satisfying and it didn't make me feel hotter at all.
Not a fan of spicy food? They offer Mul Naeng Myeon, which is essentially the same thing but without the spicy sauce (but that's what makes this so good, so please...get the bibim!!). It comes with seasonal fruit - watermelon was being served tonight. I like watermelon, but I love spice.
I also like squirting hot mustard all over my noodles. You can also add vinegar, but I don't like it in my Naeng Myeon.

Tang Soo Yuk (Korean-style Chinese dish. Sweet & Sour Pork)
Soggy :(
A childhood favourite of mine, this is an example of Korean-style Chinese cuisine. There are many dishes that you'll find in Korean restaurant under this niche - Jajamyeon (black bean noodles) is another popular example. Sticky-sweet, when it's done right the deep-fried pork, chicken, or beef has super crispy batter and is tender on the inside with a generous helping of sugary syrup, vegetables and fruit. Unfortunately, this was not done right. It was squishy, not crispy, which pretty much ruined the dish. Boo.

Kalbi (Grilled, marinated beef short ribs)
Skip this...
I've had better - much better. I am a bit of snob since I often make my own short ribs, but since I don't have a grill I like ordering them from restaurants. The cut of meat tasted low grade and fatty, and the flavour was lacking from the missing green onions. Moving on.

Mandu (dumplings Available fried or steamed)
Deep fried goodness!
Another dish that I often make on my own, I still like to order these in restaurants since I never deep-fry them at home. I was pleased with these, and I would order them again with my noodles over the kalbi any day!

I was a little frustrated with the service, but it was super-busy so I wasn't upset. The servers were rushing between tables, so they definitely weren't slacking. I was simply anxious to get my banchan because I was super hungry and jealously watching other tables get theirs while we were a little forgotten...even though we were right in front of the kitchen. Oddly, we received our mandu (dumplings) and kalbi (short ribs) before our banchan but again, they were under quite a bit of pressure so I didn't complain. We were also not given a box of cutlery, and it was hard to wave a server down. Needing something to eat the food on our table, I leaned over and swiped a box from another table.

Pics & Full Review (too long to copy and paste all of it here): http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/09/kensington-market-pedestrian-sundays.html

On Pedestrian Sundays @ Kensington, Torontonians spill onto the car-free streets to enjoy a day of music, artsy performances, random shenanigans, and delicious face-stuffing. Held on the last Sunday of every month, it has a different atmosphere than some of the more widely advertised festivals.

I love wandering the streets as I shop at the various markets and try different treats. An extra Pedestrian Sunday was held on the 7th anniversary of the '03 Blackout - what a great way to thank a few overgrown Ohio trees for a spike in pregnancies ("blackout babies"), intense street-partying and raw sewage pouring into the Rideau Canal!

Although my major draw was The Bellevue's fish tacos (which was a fail since they didn't end up serving them the day that I went), I stuck around and did what I do best: explore and eat. 

Several restaurants were offering street-eats, both from their regular menu and PS-treats. Here's a run-down of what we tried:

Segovia
Patacone
Platanos with pulled pork and sauce
Empanadas
Stuffed Pobleno


El Gordo
Burrito Empanada
Churros


Fresco's Cuisine Inc. Fish & Chips
Kabobs


Other vendors were selling Indian cuisine, pastries, jewellery, and sandwiches. As we munched away, we wandered the streets and enjoyed the fun vibe. In the spirit of Pedestrian Sunday, some locals were playing music and there were children selling some fun treats.

An oyster-loving friend was happy to discover these on sale outside of New Seaway Fish Market. Shucked to order, there were 4 varieties: French Kiss, Lucky Lime (PEI), and Kumamoto (2 for $5) as well as a BC variety (3 for $5).

I headed for the Early Bird special - $3.10 per Dim Sum dish before 11AM if you pay in cash. Fantastic presentation, delicious dishes, and great company...I left happy and satisfied. Everything was so pretty - made for excellent food pr0n :P.

Overall, my impressions of Crown Princess Fine Dining are quite positive. Everything came out with great presentation and very fresh. It's easy to order if you don't have a friend who can speak Cantonese - but I am glad my friend was there to talk to the staff as we had to find out which dishes may have eggs or nuts due to an allergy at the table.

The dining area was very impressive - a banquet-sized dining area (you can rent it for weddings), tables outdoors (although it's getting cold...so I don't think I'll be sitting out there anytime soon), a side dining area, and a couple of private wings.

At $3.10 a dish before 11AM, the value felt good for the calibre of the food. I've been to Bright Pearl in downtown Chinatown, which is also a bit cheaper if you're not concerned about presentation and quality. Given it's location, wonderfully decorated dining areas, and delicious dishes I think it's safe to say that Crown Princess will be around for awhile!

The Big Chill is one of the newest ice cream additions to the downtown core. It's colourful and fun, and was great for many late night and lunchtime ice cream breaks! Located just west of College & Bathurst, it's been challenging my addiction to Dolce Gelato. They have the freshest waffle cones that I've tried (sorry Summers, you've been bumped!) and my favourite chocolate-peanut butter mixture so far.

The best part of the dark chocolate peanut butter is that there were generous slabs of peanut butter embedded throughout. With the fresh waffle cone, I say that this is my preferred choice over Coldstone and Marbleslab's Peanut butter chocolate concoctions.

Their Nutella ice cream is weak - if you want a chocolate-hazelnut treat I recommend going to Dolce Gelato instead. They also have "Caribou Tracks" which is the same as Kawartha's ever-popular moose tracks. I've also tried their Brownie Toffee Crunch and Espresso Robusto - both yummy!

Globe Bistro is my Summerlicious 2010 winner!

Spiced chutney & warm, crusty bread
I've come to appreciate a good spread that accompanies a nice bread basket. The spiced chutney was a pleasant start to the meal while my friend and I waited for the rest of our party to arrive. 

Tom Collins Cucumber Gazpacho
Lake Erie farms cucumber, lemon cress, preserved lemon, Canadian gin 
I enjoyed this version quite a bit. Never having tried a non-tomato gazpacho before, this was my first pick for lunch. I was very pleased with the light, refreshing flavour and great consistency. Unlike Biff's gazpacho, it was neither too creamy nor smooth. I prefer it with texture, and this one definitely rivals Boulevard Cafe's tomato-based gazpacho. I did not notice the gin, which is a good thing since I'm not a fan and I'd have to do a blind taste test to see if it made a difference. This was my favourite starter.

Smoked Black Cod Brandade
Crispy shallot rings, smoked paprika essence, confit garlic crostini
The crispy shallot rings were great with the paprika essence topped with a generous helping of the brandade. The texture was similar to very thick mashed potatoes, and the cod flavour was not too strong. This was the overall favourite appetizer of the table (but not mine!)

Shaved Fennel & Purple Basil Cress Salad
Spiced pistachio, taggiashi olive dust, orange gelée
I enjoyed this salad - the fennel had a good bite, the pistachios were great, and I enjoyed the orange gelée quite a bit. The gelée was sweet with a firm texture, which paired well with the vegetables.

Lake Erie Pickerel 
Wild rice coriander salad, Millbank green peas, marjoram cress, earth chardonnay vinaigrette
In spite of my typical hesitation to order fish, I have tried it at all of my Summerlicious outings this year. I was very glad that I did not miss out on this dish! The pickerel was cooked with the skin, which was nice and crispy and the wild rice salad was wonderful. The fish was seared very well, and was neither dry nor oily and was my favourite entree. I would order the fish at Globe Bistro again based on this!
 
Swiss Chard Torte Verde
Best Baa Farm feta, charred tomato coulis, blonde frisée, chives
The warm, baked feta on top of tomato coulis was quite savoury without an overpowering feta flavour. The tomato coulis had a cheesy taste and thick texture - I personally would have preferred a stronger charred tomato flavour instead but it was a great sauce to swirl the torte around before each bite.

Seared Cumbrae's Flank Steak
Duck fat Yukon chips, vine ripe tomato, scallion, Triple Crunch aioli
Carefully cooked, the steak was wonderfully pink and juicy. The aioli was a great accompaniment and steak's usual partner in crime - the fries - were quite tasty. Thickly cut and cooked in duck fat, they were enjoyed with each tender slice of steak. This was the overall favourite.

Callebaut Dark Chocolate Torte
Espresso mousse, Cherry Lane Farms black cherry sugar
Torte, torte, torte! Topped with mousse, this thick treat was a nice way to end the meal. I liked the torte at Biff's  a bit more, as it was a more moist and was served with a fruity sauce but this was a nice, satisfying variation as well. I love the density of torte, and the flavour of dark chocolate is something that I'll never tire of. I wasn't a huge fan of the espresso mousse - while good, I would prefer something a little sweeter/fruity/saucy for this dense dessert.

Globe Summer Berry "Mess"
Vanilla spiced meringue, bacon infused whiskey, Ontario berries
Yum! I'm not usually a fan of meringue or  vanilla but this dessert was light and pleasant. The meringue was airy and sweet, and a great combination with the Ontario strawberries. The stiff peaks were lightly browned and the vanilla flavour was very pleasant with the sweet berries. 

Ewenity Crème Fraiche Panna Cotta 
Candied lemon zest, wild blueberry soup
This is the first panna cotta that I've enjoyed at a Summerlicious meal. I usually find it too creamy in taste, however joined with the blueberry soup and candied lemon this was great. I particularly enjoyed the lemon zest! The blueberry soup was akin to syrup and I'll admit that I took some torte and gave it a good swirl - it was fantastic. 

Overall, I was very pleased with my experience at Globe Bistro - definitely a nice way to end this year's Summerlicious escapades. Great service, good food made with local ingredients, and wonderful decor - a surefire recipe for a nice lunch or dinner. A pleasant bistro to go with friends or clients and it has a rooftop patio!

These donuts are fantastic!
 

Note: not directly on Queen Street - the entrance is on Peter St! I almost thought I wrote the wrong address down and headed to O&B Canteen for a croissant.

This cute little coffee shop offers an array of sandwiches, croissants, muffins, and cookies. Best of all, you can get hot fresh donuts that are made to order!

They're quick and efficient and watching the donuts being made within seconds of ordering was a delight for my inner child. Once done, they're thrown into a bowl and tossed with sugar and cinnamon before being thrown into a paper bag or a bowl if you prefer...but it's much more fun to get it in the paper bag :P

The entire café is noticeably tidy & clean, and I found the lady quite pleasant (not that the guy wasn't - he was just busy and I was slow to choose a drink). She also took care to ensure that every order of donut was cooked to perfection :)

Yum! These donuts disappeared quickly . They're the perfect size to just pop in your mouth, and not heavy at all. They're super fresh, hot, and a delicious treat. I got a full dozen for $4 - worth every penny :)

The shop is a delightful place to visit with a friend or a book. I will definitely return for a freshly made cookie :). I didn't see any signs of Wifi, but it'd be a perfect spot to study if they do.\

I went to Frank's for a late night dessert and I was really disappointed. I thought that it would be good, from positive online reviews and the fact that the AGO Cafe's treats also get positive feedback. I've also heard lovely things about their brunch. Unfortunately, the desserts were not fresh at all - way overpriced for what we got. Is it worth returning for a meal?


Summer Berry Pudding
Raspberries, strawberries, red currants, and vanilla whipped cream
While tasty, I think that this would've been better topped on top of a cake rather than being served as a messy slab of pudding. It was more mushy than pudding-y.

Coffee and Donut
Chocolate espresso pot de creme with dulce de leche whipped cream and cinnamon sugared mini donut
Cute presentation - chilled pot de creme had a nice chocolate-espresso flavour, but I wish it was a bit stronger or denser or had bits of chocolate in it.
The donut was quite disappointing. Despite being made in-house, both the twist and the donut were stale and lacked flavour. I would have been happier with a Timbit from Tim Hortons - for 16 cents!

Fried Calamari with Aioli & Salsa Fresca
The lightly breaded and deep-fried rings and tentacles were tender and neither overcooked nor too salty - two things that often ruin calamari. It wasn't put in the deep fryer for too long, so it wasn't especially crispy and the batter was so-so. I personally would have liked a bit more spice. It was okay, but I've had better value from Mezes in Greektown. The *best* calamari I've ever tried was from Yoso's-Call Joso's in Yorkville - pricey, but spiced and fried to perfection. Would not order calamari from Wish again.
 
Romaine Salad w Cherry Tomatoes, Herb Dressing, Feta Cheese, & Crostini  
The waitress made a strong recommendation for the salad - she raved that she loved it and it is really great starter. Really? I think the picture speaks for itself. Romaine lettuce, a couple cherry tomatoes and an unmemorable dressing. Very poor value at $9.
 
Lamb Burger with Tomato Tzatziki & Feta
The saving grace of our lunch - the lamb was nicely ground and mixed with a good dash of cumin. Tender and juicy, I savoured it to make up for the disappointing salad and so-so calamari. The bun was a typical white hamburger-type of bun - too bad, really. I think that a great bun on a good burger makes a world of difference. The fries were decent - nice, thin, a little on the softer side (like the calamari! Perhaps this is just their style)

The patio and interior are simple and great for a summer brunch or lunch. Fresh, sunny flowers at each table, simple decor, and comfy couches created a low-key, relaxed atmosphere. However, for the value I don't think I will be returning for lunch...although I may give the weekend brunch another go. Maybe.

After another ketchup-y plate of pad-thai at a local restaurant, I decided that I had to hunt for a great traditional version in Toronto. Mission accomplished!

A very late dinner on Pi-Tom's patio coupled with pleasantly humid weather made a few of us reminisce of travels to Asia. Usually bustling & full during dinner, we arrived around 9pm and had full reign of the patio! Still decorated from the Pride Parade, the colourful patio is enveloped in plants and trees, making you forget that you're in the downtown core.  

Yum Mamuang (Mango Salad)
Green mango, red onion, chili, mint leaves, lemon juice
A great start to our dinner, the ingredients were fresh and the lemon juice-chili combination complimented the mangoes quite well. The mangoes were ripe, but still had enough bite so you can get a good stab with your fork each time. The balance between fruit and vegetables was great - too much red onion can kill a mango salad.


Fish Cakes
Deep-fried ground white fish mixed with chili and long bean
What a pleasant surprise - when I heard "fish cakes" I was expecting spongy slivers of processed fish. Instead, we received tasty well-marinated slices accompanied with a hearty peanut sauce. The sauce was full of peanuts and flavour with a smooth, non-oily texture. I ended up scooping leftovers on some rice, yum!

Chicken Satay
4 skewers of marinated chicken served with cucumber salad
Tender, juicy chicken with a sweet & salty flavour - I wish these were sold on the street. They'd be the perfect snack! A simple yet winning appetizer.

The servers were very friendly. The food came quick throughout the night, and upon request they gave us a jug of water to save the waitress the hassle of constantly refilling our glasses. We did not realize that they closed at 10pm, but they did not rush us out of the restaurant and did not seem annoyed that we were unknowingly staying well past their closing time.
 
Authentic Pad Thai
Thai rice noodles stir fried with sweet & sour tamarind sauce, chicken, shrimp, root vegetable, bean sprouts, tofu, coconut sauce, wrapped in a fried egg crepe
What a difference from ketchup-based pad thai! Tamarind is by far the superior sauce. While ketchup (or "sweet and sour tomato sauce" as some restaurants call it) is very sugary, tamarind gave it a more tangy flavour and the portion in the egg crepe was quite generous. It wasn't sopping with sauce, and there meat, noodle, and sprouts ratio was great, and everything was cooked quite nicely

Duck Curry
Roasted duck in curry, lychee, bamboo shoots, peppers, and basil
Full of bell peppers, broccoli and bamboo shoots, this aromatic curry was deliciously packed with flavour and roasted duck. To be honest, I didn't notice lychee...probably because I was too busy wolfing everything down!The curry was wonderfully seasoned; sweet, comforting and the favourite dish of the night for our table.

Peanut Chicken
Chicken stir-fried with peanut sauce & long bean
The simple peanut chicken dish was very flavourful with moist bites of chicken. As expected, it had a very strong peanut taste, but wasn't at all pasty in texture. While yummy on a summer night, I can really see myself enjoying a bowl in the winter - and Pi-Tom's does delivery!

Plamuek Pad Prik (Spicy Squid)
Squid in hot pepper sauce with bamboo shoots and basil sauce
A generous offering of vegetables and squid, this plate disappeared quickly! Green beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, onions, and squid, all smothered and cooked in an addictive basil sauce. Even when the food was gone, we were spooning the sauce on rice until the plate was super clean!

Goong Pong Ka-Ree (Stir Fried Shrimp Dinner Special)
Stir-fried shrimp with curry powder, egg, onion, chili garlic sauce, sweet peppers.  Served with pineapple fried rice and pineapple salad.
Another favourite of the table - although the pineapples were canned, the salad was nice to scoop up with the shrimp and rice. The fried rice wasn't greasy (something that I'm usually wary of), and the shrimp had a great kick that kept us going back for more. 

By the end of the night, all of us left happy & satisfied. Every single dish was full of flavour, the service was pleasant, and the patio was welcoming. A surprisingly delicious find, just off of Yonge Street and I will be back to try their soups and sticky-rice dessert!

*Update*
Pi-Tom's Mango Sticky Rice  (~$6)
Thumbs down. I suppose I can't fault them for the blah mango - peak season has come and gone. 
Mango Sticky Rice is supposed to be salty & sweet...I would've liked a bit more of a salty flavour in the coconut-milk. I could be wrong, but perhaps the rice wasn't soaked enough in the coconut-milk or maybe there wasn't enough (to my liking anyways. I'm no Thai-dessert expert) because I would've liked a milkier consistency.

As a chocolate addict, I was intrigued by the chocolate-banana-jalapeño juice. Also ordered were the honeydew-avocado-banana and a lemonade made with crushed mint leaves and sugar cane. ($4)

I liked them all - the lemonade was the most refreshing for the hot day, but I enjoyed the banana-chocolate- jalpeno flavour the most. With a consistency that's more shake-y than juice-y (makes sense given the ingredients), I enjoyed a jalapeño "bite" after each chocolately slurp. I wish they used a darker chocolate instead though - I think that the stronger cacao taste would go really well with the jalapeño.

The honeydew-avocado-banana was light, sweet and also on the thicker side. Next time, I think I will ask for some ice cubes in my drink even though it will dilute it a bit more just to keep it cold.

The Squirrel ($10)
Peanut butter, sardines, hot chili sauce, cucumber, sprouts and white cheddar on dark rye
How could I not order this? The combination of salty, buttery, cheesy, and spicy was pretty darn good. I just wish there was more! At $10 though, it's not bad considering the big bowl of soup that came with it.

I'd love to try this with a few slices of tomato and avocado. My friend disagrees saying that it's just make it too soggy but I think it'd be great. I think I will request that addition next time, if possible. I like tomatoes on everything though...

The Beach ($10)
Chick pea salad, roasted coconut, yakinori, sesame, sprouts, and cheddar on dark rye
Not bad, a decent healthy sandwich. The chickpeas were chickpeas, the sprouts were sprouts - I got exactly what I ordered. While tasty, I won't be craving it anytime soon and I'd sooner try something else off of their menu.

The Fish Fry ($14)
Golden fried Ontario Rainbow Trout, with a dandelion & avocado mixed green salad, white vinaigrette.
The Rainbow Trout was well done, although I wish there was more to the salad. I wonder how much it would have cost to upgrade to the Greens with Envy salad? Purple kale, dandelion, cucumber, green onion, sprouts, and broccoli sounds pretty darn good.

The following two items come with sandwiches, or you can order them separately.
Soupe de Soleil ($4)
The butternut squash and was thick, filling, and satisfying. I actually like my squash soups a bit chunky so I was quite happy with this homey bowl. There was also a bit of tomato & scallions and possibly carrot, if I recall correctly. Yum.

Black Beans ($6)
The black bean dip with avocado was also tasty with the red tortilla chips. Dense and chunky, the bowl was spooned clean. I wished there were a few more large chips in the pile, but no biggie - I just scooped some dip with my spoon with the little chip bits. In hindsight, I think I would've liked this in the sandwich too!

Julies' Pies!
Ooh...pie. With Wanda's Pie in the Sky down the street I was surprised to see "Julies' Pie" for dessert. I racked my poor memory for a bakery named Julie's and drawing a blank, I asked where/who Julie('s) is. It turns out that one of the owner's (Ryan) cousin's wife bakes yummy desserts for their cafe. Talk about family love :) It was a sweltering hot day, but he convinced me that the pie was "reaaaalllly good" with a knowing "omg" look on his face. Not that my sweet tooth ever needs much convincing anyways.

And "reaaaallly good" it was! Totally catering to my not-so-secret love affair with Ontario peaches, the filling was just the right amount of sweet and the crust (which I think is just as important!) was nice and soft. While my friend said he would've preferred more of a "bite" for both the peaches and the crust, I was quite satisfied as I liked the super-soft pieces of fruit. Mmmm. It wasn't syrupy or overloaded with sugar. This pie-lover was satisfied.

The service from co-owner Chris was very friendly and conversational. I heard they were going to offer fish tacos at yesterday's Pedestrian Sundays however a combination of a precarious weather forecast and something about the cousin who was going to cook 'em up made it a no-go. I must have looked crest-fallen as I got a consoling tap on the shoulder from Ryan (is it creepy that I'm using their first names as if I know them?) and a promise of their appearance on August 29th's Pedestrian Sunday. Sadly I will be out of town, but as a fanatic of Little Italy's Fish Store, at least I know where to get my fish-fix. Pout.

Overall, I had a good time at The Bellevue. While there were some things that I would like to tweak, everything tasted good and homey. The items are things that I could easily make at home, but the creative combinations certainly stirred my imagination. It won't be long before I start making my own Sardine-Nut Butter-Rye sandwiches...which may or may not be pleasant for The Bellevue to hear!

Located in a plaza in Oakville, I will admit that I was skeptical about Sweet Smoke. A great barbecue joint beside a Mr. Sub and Funky Thai 2 Go? In Oakville? Hmm.

Brightly lit and very clean, the interior looked newly renovated and ready for some hungry paddlers. We grabbed a table and were promptly given menus, which we scoured for the meatiest, tastiest sounding dishes. Paddling 20km during a 3 hour torrential downpour makes you hungry.

Sweet Smoke is both family-friendly and a good hang out, and the owner and the waitresses provided great service. After dinner, the owner was quite chatty and talked about how he slow cooked his pork and what he thought of his competition. It was a very relaxed atmosphere for a casual Saturday night dinner. They also serve homemade iced tea - sweetened, brewed tea which I found better than the bottled variety. 

Grilled Portobello Mushroom Melt
Arugula, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Grilled Red Onions, Gruyère Cheese, Guajillo Aioli on Toasted Rosemary Focaccia
A generous helping of portobello paired extremely well with the gruyère. This is the same cheese that Biff's used for their crepes, and I must say that I am a fan! Although I'm not usually a fan of cheesy sandwiches, gruyère pairs very well with meat and vegetables, this sandwich being no exception. I especially enjoyed the toasted focaccia bread. Warm, "meaty" with mushrooms, and toasty - this was my second favourite sandwich!

Southwestern Club
Hickory Smoked Turkey, Crispy Pancetta, Tomato, Greens, Avocado and Chipotle Mayonnaise on Ciabatta
We were surprised to receive this sandwich, because we only inquired about it but didn't actually order it (whoops). It didn't matter - we were so hungry that it was a welcome appearance so there was no need to complain or send it back. The smoked turkey was nice and juicy, the ciabatta was was buttered and grilled. I would have liked a bit more pancetta for additional flavour. Decent sandwich, but the mushroom melt definitely eclipsed this sandwich. Even though it was my least favourite sandwich of the night, it was still tasty!

El Cubano 
Pulled Pork, Shaved Smoked Turkey, Manchego Cheese and Quick Pickles on Sesame Seed Bun
Y-U-M! This was the best sandwich of the night. Smokey turkey, tender pulled pork, tangy sauce, and pickles was a great combination. Although it would probably be considered "nontraditional" for a pulled pork sandwich, I would have preferred it with the rosemary focaccia bread from the portobello mushroom melt and melted cheese. I liked the quick pickles quite a bit, I wouldn't mind ordering a side of them the next time I go in. The toasted sesame seed bun was soft & good, but wish it was a little more toasted - but the combination of the pulled pork and the turkey was heavenly so no complaints! Sammy win!

Flat Iron Steak Burrito 
Drunken Beans, Queso Fresco, Ancho Chile Salsa and Cilantro
Unable to find a great steak burrito in Toronto (tried Burrito Boyz, Burro Burrito, Big Fat Burrito and Burrito Loco) I felt like I was taking a chance ordering this. It came tender, juicy, and oh-so-delicious with melted cheese and great salsa. It was a good simple burrito, the meat was very well cooked - I wish it was jammed a bit more with veggies but considering that I wasn't at a burrito joint I can't expect to get a fat burrito. I wish there was a fast food burrito as tender as this...

Mixed Barbecue Sampler
Hickory Smoked BBQ Ribs, Slow Smoked Pulled Pork, Cowboy Beans, and Jicama slaw
I came for the pulled pork, but when I spotted an item that gave you pulled pork and ribs, I was sold! The pulled pork was great - tender, juicy, smokey, and full of flavour. Everything I look for in pulled pork. While some might be turned off by the orange-coloured sauce, I happened to love the citrus flavour. If I could tweak one little thing, it would be the hickory flavour - more please!
The ribs however, were a little on the dry side but they still had a nice smokey flavour that I enjoyed. They weren't too dry, but I've had better.
The beans were tasty and saucy but the slaw was just slaw - I later learned that many people top their sandwiches with the slaw. I would've tried it if it occurred to me!

Cake and Shake!
Blackout Cake with Dark Chocolate Pudding, and Vanilla Bean Milkshake
The chocolate fiend in me was definitely satisfied with this rich, moist cake. Creamy chocolate mousse layers nestled between dense cake was a great way to end the meal. If you like frothy and richly-flavoured milk shakes, you will love this. Mmm...

If you're looking for a savoury sandwich, Oakville's Sweet Smoke Barbecue & Grill is worth a visit! Friendly service (although we did accidentally get a sandwich that we didn't order), warm meaty sandwiches, and a bright interior made this a great place to grab a bite.

Insomnia's been around forever and it's still going strong! Rec this place for lunch
 
Tried:
Eggs Charlotte ($11.50)
Insomnia's hollandaise sauce has a bit of a cheesy flavour. It adds a bright colour and if you like a bit of cheese, then you'll probably prefer Insomnia's hollandaise over some other breakfast joints. The eggs were well poached - not as perfectly as Hoof Cafe's but still nice and runny and the side of greens was good to nosh on between bites.

Eggs Manami ($10)
Ordered off of their "Brunch Features" menu, the Eggs Manami had wonderful curried rice patties. This is a delicious alternative to English muffins, and I recommend this over their regular Eggs Benny.!

Home Fries
Their home fries are great! The potatoes are freshly tossed in a bbq-y sauce, and they're not at all soggy. These were quickly snarfed and definitely worth adding to your order if they don't come with it anyways.

French Toast
Heaven on Earth ($10.50)
Yummy - It was crispy and filling with a generous amount of fruit. The cream cheese was good, but I would've enjoyed it just as much without. I'm not so sure that the strawberries were wild as advertised, but they were fresh! This was great drenched in maple syrup.

Baked Pancakes ($10)
So these aren't so much pancakes as cakes-baked-in-a-pan. They are huge and are made to order and from scratch. They are very thick and dense, and take at least 20 minutes upon ordering to arrive. We were definitely stuffed after polishing these off!
 
Chocolate Banana Pancakes & Apple Cinnamon Pancakes
While good, I don't think I'd order it for myself but as a post-breakfast treat to share with a larger group.

Overall, Insomnia is a bright cheery breakfast joint in the Annex. I recommend it if you're looking for a tasty brunch at a great value. Their pleasant service, bright dining and bar areas, and great brunch options make it a great choice. Definitely a step up from other local breakfast joints that I've tried with respect to service, atmosphere and quality of food. Get the home fries and their egg dishes are quite tasty.

I've also been there for dinner. If you go, you *must* try their Climax Cake. It's as good as the name suggests ;). Flourless chocolate torte, wonderfully dense and rich - I would return just for that dessert alone! Their pizzas are also quite good and named after Toronto neighbourhoods - I tried their Annex pizza. Their Mediterranean Platter and fries with aioli are decent appetizers to share with the table - but the pizza would be better.

Located behind Pacific Mall, Chung King Garden serves an excellent full-course Peking Duck in record time. Every dish was fantastic, and the duck was crispy, non-fatty, and flavourful.
Knowing that it takes 20-30 minutes for the food to be prepared, we ordered one of their House Specials to tide us over as well as some white rice.

Szechwan Shredded Beef ($10.95
)Crispy yet tender, crunchy but not oily, this was the perfect dish to ease our hunger pangs while we waited for the duck. I was really pleased with the beef; it had great flavour from the chili and it wasn't drenched in sauce so it stayed crispy. Shredded carrots and green onions added to the flavour, and it was great with rice.

Authentic Beijing Roast Duck (3 Courses) ($37.95)
1. Crispy Duck Skin & Breast
2. Duck Stir Fry
3. Duck Soup

Course 1: Crispy, Roasted Skin
I could hardly contain my excitement when the first course arrived. The dark skin was shining and crispy-looking, with duck breast peeking out from underneath.The flavour was fantastic. There was also little to no fat hiding between the skin and breast, which but they've rendered it so well that it was still moist.
With it came steamed dry crepes to wrap the roasted duck, vegetables, tian mian jian (a savoury-sweet bean sauce), and crispy shrimp crackers. The crepes are nice and thin, but thick enough to wrap everything without breaking before shoving it into your mouth. Eat the crackers while they're super-fresh and hot - like pork rinds, they get soft and blah over time.

Course 2: Minced, Fried Duck in Lettuce Wraps
There were also bits of crispy white noodles hidden among the pile of stir fried duck, vegetables, and saucey goodness. The sweet bean sauce is a great base for stir fries, and II enjoyed tofu, water chestnuts, pepper, carrots, onion, and whatever other vegetables were in the mix. There was just enough to give it flavour, and they clearly weren't just "fillers" for the dish to look bigger.
We eagerly grabbed spoonfuls and scooped the duck into pieces iceberg lettuce. I also enjoyed it with white rice when we ran out of lettuce. Win.

Course 3: Duck Soup
Last to arrive was a soup made from the remaining skin, meat, and bones. The broth was surprisingly light and tasty - not at all oily! A friend said this was her favourite course for this very reason. I really wonder what they put in this broth to make it so flavourful in such a short amount of time. Tofu, duck, and nappa cabbage was plentiful and we cleaned this bowl up without a problem. I can only imagine how wonderful this soup must be on a cold, winter night.

I just enjoyed a large halibut burrito from Burrito Boyz. It's my favourite in Toronto along with Big Fat's Pulled Pork Burrito. I'm curious about BFB's breakfast one! I'm so addicted to the halibut though, that I can't seen to order anything else from BBz. I am in such a late night burrito mood tonight!

 

I had to award both Burrito Boyz and Big Fat Burrito #1 to be fair. When I am craving a fish burrito, I go to BB. When I want something meaty, I go to BFB. It's as simple as that.

1a. Burrito Boyz
Halibut Burrito ($8.85 small, $9.73 large
)Halibut Burrito - so much sauce, so much win!
The tortilla is toasted on a flat-top grill and the large gives you 1.5 lb of fish! Add a very generous helping of sauces: Lime-Chili Burrito sauce, sour cream, and hot sauce. Most of my friends get little to no hot sauce, but I like asking for two lines. Yum.
I almost wrote this place off after trying their steak burrito - the beef was tough and unappetizing, despite the plethora of fillings. I'm really glad that I gave the place another go and tried their halibut burrito! I can ever resist its call...while curious about their veggie soy and shrimp burritos, I haven't been able to say no to halibut.
1b. Big Fat Burrito
Pulled Pork
I lo-o-o-ve their pulled pork burrito! It's always saucy, soft, and so good with guacamole. I always manage to stuff myself with a large without a single regret! You can get some yam in it too!

3. Burrito Bandidos
Steak Burrito
This is third because I only tried their steak - I bet their fish is just as good as Burrito Boyz. If I was ranking this on the steak alone, it'd be lower but I ought to be fair since the owners used to work together at Burrito Boyz so they're virtually identical.

4. Z-teca
Beef Barbacoa Burrito
Tried the one at Fairview Mall - this a popular chain. Pretty good if you're in the area and want a burrito fix! They're also often featured on Group Buy sites, so keep your eyes open for deals.

5. Chipotle Mexican Grill
Carnitas
Owned by McDonalds, this has been a major hit-or-miss for me. The last time I went, the person who made my burrito jammed it full of Carnitas and I was very pleased. The time before that, the server was quite grumpy and I got a small handful of chicken. Nonetheless, when I needed a quick burrito fix around Yonge & Dundas, Chipotle did the trick...until Big Fat Burrito moved in. I rather like their Cilantro-Lime flavoured rice

6. Burro Burrito
Steak ($7.99 Large)
Located beside my beloved Fish Store, I popped by after a game of floor hockey. This was in my early burrito-blitzing days and I think that I've since realized that steak burritos are not the way to go unless if you're ordering them from a good restaurant like my visit to Sweet Smoke's BBQ

7. Burrito Loco
Chicken Burrito
So close to being finished before the picture was taken! Oops!

Of course, there's also Sweet Smoke's Flat Iron Steak burrito but since it's at a restaurant it's in a totally different class on it's own.
Steak Burrito win @ $9, but not quick eats on the streets of Toronto

Honourable Mentions - Not true Burritos but I still love 'em:
1. The Fish Store
Tried almost everything - best: Black Cod Burrito with Avocado
Honestly, if this was open later and closer to my place I'd get this over Burrito Boyz any day. The Fish Store is fantastic - they offer a huge selection of seafood that you can in sandwich or a wrap (which they call a burrito). Love Love Love.

2. NY Subway
Potato burrito, cauliflower burrito, lamb burrito
These aren't traditional burritos either - however their potato & cauliflower burritos are great! Totally recommend getting one of these over their meaty options.

Tastefully decorated with wine bottles, glasses, and interesting lighting fixtures, the interior feels open and bright thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows. A fantastic outdoor back patio includes an outdoor bar and lounge areas. 

The service was pleasant and patient - We were given a bread basket with crispy flat bread seasoned with tarragon and a few slices of white bread. It was accompanied with a rather plain marinara sauce, which foreshadowed the upcoming meal.

Baby Red Romaine & Escarole Salad
Cara Cara orange, fennel, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and old wine vinaigrette 
A light start of fresh lettuce, a slightly tart vinaigrette, ripe Cara Cara orange, and cheese. While the orange and the dressing was enjoyable, something was left to be desired...perhaps it's because of my unrefined wine and cheese palette, but I wasn't particularly impressed. Memorable Summerlicious starter salads include the butterleaf truffle salad at Truffles at the Four Seasons (which has since closed) and Tutti Matti's carpaccio salads.

Bigeye Tuna Tartare & Spicy Sopressata 
Cracked olives, garlic grissini, arugula, lemon and Sicilian organic extra virgin olive oil 
Fresh tuna tartare on a bed of salami was a welcome dish, especially since I've never tried sopressata before. The saltyness of the cured ham paired with the freshnesses of the tuna created an interesting balance between bites. The olives were typical, and the bread sticks brought a crunch but no flavour to the plate. Perhaps if they were toasted a bit more or rolled in sesame, it would've been a nice compliment to the dish.

Wild & Tame Mushroom Soup 
Six kinds of mushrooms (no butter or cream)
Thick, warm, and hearty - this had the rich texture of a comforting soup despite the lack of cream or butter. I was impressed with the consistency and I love the taste of mushrooms so I thoroughly enjoyed this soup. As with the salad, there was something lacking - the "wow" factor that I always hope for at 'licious restaurants. The best mushroom soup that I've tasted was Wild Mushroom Soup from Tutti Matti - unfortunately not on their current menu.


Grilled Top Sirloin Fettina
Charred onion, heirloom tomato and rocket salad with crumbled Gorgonzola
The vegetables were nice and warm, and the sauce surrounding the steak sweet however the steak wasn't particularly interesting or great. Tender and nicely cooked, it was a good, simple cut of sirloin but didn't blow me away or leave a lasting impression on my palette.

Grilled Jail Island Salmon
Pickled summer beets, heirloom carrots, watercress salad and horseradish crème fraîche
Despite my half-success with the fish at Biff's Bistro, I decided that it was worth another go. While tasty, I'm quickly getting bored with this Summerlicious lunch. The beets were nice, warm, and soft and the horseradish crème fraîche had great flavour. However the salmon was...just salmon.

Roasted Portobello Mushroom & Brie Quesadilla
Caramelized onions, pico de gallo, chipotle crema, plantain tortilla chips and cilantro cress
My personal favourite of the entrées, the chipotle cream had a tangy flavour that tasted great with the pico de gallo and quesadilla. The pico de gallo (salsa) was ripe and simple. Always a fan of portobello, these quesadillas had great flavour. While an interesting visual, the tortilla chips were lacking the flavour I usually enjoy from plantains. As a plantain chip lover, they were a disappointment. I'd rather crack open a bag of the Samai Plantain chips that I got addicted to Barbados.

Chocolate Toffee Crunch Cheesecake
Dulce de leche cream
Thick cheesecake that was more toffee-like than chocolate. The caramel was pleasant with the dense cake. I wasn't a fan of the bit of toffee that accompanied the cake but overall I'd say that this was the best dessert out of the three.


Bavarian Vanilla Cream
Ontario strawberry compote and dark cherry balsamic
Nice and warm with a smooth texture, the vanilla cream dessert sat on one of the better compotes that I've tried. I found myself scooping this dessert up more for the compote than the cream.

Coconut Rum Baba 
Tropical fruit salad and banana cream
This spongy cake was covered with coconut shavings over pineapple, mango, and lychee. A sweet, generous drizzle of rum syrup soaked into the cake quite nicely. While I wasn't the biggest fan of this dessert initially, over time as I enjoyed my company it grew on me. It wasn't too rich or filling.

Wonderfully designed and decorated, Jump Café & Bar creates a vibrant, young, and upscale environment quite well. I would return for a drink at the bar, and the service was fantastic. However, I thought it was missing that the "oomph" factor that would make me wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for future Summerlicious romps. This is a good spot to take someone who wants a very simple no-frills meal.

My friend and I happily feasted three mains and an appetizer. That's not to say that the portion sizes aren't generous - because they are! It was just that good. Instead of picking two out of three entrees that we really wanted, we just tacked on another plate. You gotta make the visit count, right?

Excited to Hoof-it-up, I got there a bit early and was surprised to find a line quickly gather behind me. Luckily, I was relaxing on the bench & enjoying the Sunday morning otherwise I wouldn't have gotten a table (not that the bar would've been bad). By 9:45AM, quite a few fellow brunchers were eagerly peering through the window in anticipation of the 10AM opening time.

The cafe itself is quite small, so go early if you want to avoid a wait or would prefer a seat by the window. Similarly, I arrived at Black Hoof right when they opened at 6PM, and just managed to grab a table. I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar though, they have fantastic cocktails and the service is jovial and chatty. However, for a group of more than 3 people a table is clearly better.

Bone Marrow Strawberry Beignets
Winning Combination: Cinnamon, Sugar, Bone Marrow, Strawberries & Long Peppers
These delicious little bone marrow pastries are coated in sugar and cinnamon. The donuts were hot, fresh, and filled with a sweet strawberry and long pepper jelly. Deep fried bits of joy, these were the perfect size and a tasty $5 appetizer. More please!
The two other starters are currently available for $5; a pastry filled with bacon as well as ribs in a beer sauce. While curious about the others, these donuts were a winning choice. Well...honestly based on the entire meal, I'm convinced that anything would be a solid option!

Beef Tongue Grilled Cheese
When I spotted this on the menu, succulent memories of Beef Tongue on Brioche from Black Hoof wafted through my mind. Slathered and fried, the buttery bread had toasty grill marks and neatly sandwiched an extremely tender and generous portion of beef tongue. I needed to erase the disaster that was Friday's T&T's rubbery beef tongue from my mind and this just blew it away. Hello satisfaction.
Packed with comforting flavour, every bite made me stop to savour the combination of Provolone, Brie, crispy-buttery bread, and amazing thinly-shaved beef tongue. The little piggy-skewer with 4 pickles was a nice touch, similar to Black Hoof's Beef Tongue on Brioche Sandwich. Between the two, I'd say that this was better...but trust me...they are both delicious. Not bad for my first grilled cheese sandwich!

Suckling Pig Eggs Benny
Perfectly runny egg yolks, light Hollandaise sauce over pickled jalapeño
The Eggs Benny was perfectly poached. Warm yolk slowly oozed out when pierced with a fork, and every bite was covered in heavenly Hollandaise sauce. The sauce wasn't too rich, and did not mask the wonderful porky flavour on top of the fresh biscuit. The suckling pig had a barbecue flavour, and reminded me of very tender pulled pork without the sauce. The arugula had a lemony zip and the dish was surrounded by pork rinds. I could be wrong, but the rinds tasted like they were made a bit earlier as they were a bit soft rather than hot and crispy. They were spiced with barbecue powder. While a nice touch, I didn't care so much for them.
I recently told a friend that my next food-hunt would be for Toronto's best Eggs Benedict. However, I'm pretty sure that now I've tasted this, there is no need. Even without the suckling pig, this eclipses all other Eggs Benny dishes I've ever had.

Brioche French Toast with Foie Gras
O-M-G.
I could easily leave the description as that, because that is all that was running through my mind when we received it, while I was eating it, and after it was done.
The Brioche French Toast was perfect - the thick French bread was perfectly battered & fried, covered in sweet-syrupy goodness, roasted macadamia nuts, a dollop of creme fraiche, and bright red strawberries. Oh, and quite possibly the largest serving of Foie Gras that I've ever seen i my life.
Words can't describe how great I thought it was - sweet syrup, hot fresh brioche, seared Foie Gras, macadamia nuts, creme fraiche, and fruit. How could this not be amazing?! Now I want every restaurant to start making French Toast with brioche. Like the Eggs Benny, this wins the C&T prize for Toronto's Best French Toast. Sorry Kalendar, but your banana & mango stuffed French toast was just trumped BIG TIME.
A $26 plate French Toast might sound quite steep (it's $12 for the French Toast and $14 for the Foie Gras) but I definitely think that it's worth a try at least once. Go with a few friends and split it if you need to...
Everything about the the meal was great. From the upbeat and friendly service to the colours and presentation of each plate.

Visit #1
Charcuterie Platter ($16 small/$25 large) & Thuet Bread ($2 small/$4 large
)This is a wonderful introduction for those who have never tried charcuterie. Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter.
All offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment.
The star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.

Roasted Bone Marrow ($9)
Hollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.

Tongue in Brioche ($13)
The sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure.
Incredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.

Raw Horse Sammy w/ Hot Sauce ($22)
Fresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The "HORSE" spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.

Visit #2
Crispy Pig Ear Salad
Strips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressing
I liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected.
The pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...

Fluke Crudo
Fluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing.
I really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :)

N'Duja & Corn Tagliatelle
House tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top.
Mmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!

Pork Belly, Squid,& Melon
Baby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish.
While the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.

Calf's Brain Ravioli
House ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavings
So...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =)

The waffle was thick but not crispy - I wish I asked him to leave it on there for another minute. There are other flavours (cinnamon, maple, strawberry) but I don't see myself returning anytime soon...especially since Marbleslab's dark chocolate ice cream is just across the street.

I just wanted to say that this service is great, only it doesn't take the place of the family doctor. the doctors are great, for example my grandmother was really sick, and if it wasn't for the doctor suggesting that she go to the hospital she wouldn't have been around.

We brought some guests here from Switzerland and one of them said it was the best crepe she ever had. I'm inclined to agree. 

I'm working my way through the entire menu and I've loved them all. Go with something sweet or savory; you won't be disappointed.

Flophouse. 

Formerly the Imperial Palace, only the name has changed. The location on the strip is prime, but the building should be demolished and rebuilt. The only reason I'm giving The Quad a one star rating is because I haven't figured out how to give it a negative rating.
  
Navigating the nightmarish layout from the self parking garage to the hotel was made extra special by the young man urinating while his buddies unloaded their beer coolers from their car.       

Checking in was ok, but just ok. The staff is friendly enough. The elevators are small, slow, and dirty.         

Everywhere in the hotel has filthy, stained carpet and walls. Evidence of human DNA is everywhere. Let your imagination run wild. I did. 

Bathrooms are outdated and gross. Let's talk about the ten person bath tub/shower with ceiling mirror for just a moment. The drain... doesn't. And cleaning those monster tubs can't be easy, so I think they just skip it altogether. Shower shoes are recommended. 

The ceiling mirror above the bed adds another touch of class. Walking around the room in your socks is not a good idea. The dirty carpet will only ruin them. Again, shower shoes.  
                      
The irate drunk male in the hallway shouting F bombs about how unfair his life is at one o'clock in the morning (for about an hour) was nice, but the 8 a.m. construction project on the floor above was really great.

We did not bother going to the pool. Our hearts just weren't in it.

Look, you get what you pay for. And if you are under 30 and are looking for a place to party, then The Quad is for you. But if you are a grown-up with self esteem, go elsewhere.

I brought my friend here to celebrate her divorce and it was so much fun!!! When we first walked in and sat down I had a guy come up to me and just start giving me a lap dance. He didn't ask and when he was done wanted to be paid. For this reason alone I did not give 5 stars. Besides that the experience was great! I will say that JT is the best. I had a few dances from him. He was my fav by far! All of the guys were great while dancing on stage. It's just a lot of fun all around. I definitely recommend it!

The Posh Club Hop party bus is a scam. Me and 12 friends booked the party bus expecting a great Vegas club experience. Let me start by saying the hop is a club crawl. Meaning you walk through the casinos to get to the various clubs. 

To start, we met at Mandalay's House of Blues.  The House of Blues was the first stop. We went in for about 15 minutes then walked to the second location which was the Foundation room also located at Mandalay hotel. After that, our tour director (lol) walked us to the third club L.A.X(Luxor).  By then our feet hurt from all the walking so no one went inside the club. We sat outside the club until it was time for the next destination. If we had known this was a club walk, we would have worn walking shoes. 

Following LAX , we finally got on the over booked party bus (There were not enough seat). Luckily two individuals decided to abandon the field trip after walking to LAX. Anyway, the fun began on the bus where we were served watered down premixed drinks. We danced and got a little wild until rain water started leaking into the bus from the overhead emergency exit. The Party host did seem to care that we were getting rained on. 

Due to the rain, we skipped the Vegas sign photo op. 

Finally, the final destination and the end of the hop was the Chateau club located in the Paris hotel. This club was hopping and we partied for a couple  hours. 

Don't waste your money. You'd be better off renting your own limo bus.  Note to Posh... Include in your description , "be prepared for a lot of walking".

Dommage de voir une telle attitude surtout pour un Resto ou la note avoisine les 150$ pour simplement quelques sushis....

Don't know what has happened to this place but my meal there last night was honestly just NOT good. I have been here before and loved it...even going so far as to call it one of the best restaurants in Charlotte if not the best. Last night, that was far from the case...and on Valentines Day too!

There were four of us in our party. We ordered a combination of the 3 course special menu and the regular a la carte menu. I had the lobster and truffle risotto which tasted so fishy I could not choke it down. My mom got the oysters Rockefeller which arrived like warm and salty as you can possibly imagine. My husbands butternut squash soup was also like warm and honestly tasted like something out of a Campbell's can (let's face it I've had better Campbell's). I sent mine back and got the mixed green salad instead. That was actually good although not outstanding which is what I expect from this type of restaurant. 

Still trying to be positive we moved on to the next course. Out of 3 dishes bc my husband and dad got the same thing, 2 were sent back. The scallops were gritty, fishy and just plain gross. My mom's swordfish was also fishy and tasted just "not fresh" is how I can describe it. The only decent dish was my filet, which I still had to be sent back to have cooked correctly bc my medium came out just plain rare.

The dessert plate was decent and we did eat that, but all in all I was extremely underwhelmed and will NOT be dining here again unless they do something major with their kitchen. Even the manager seemed extremely inexperienced and barely uttered an apology for this disaster of a meal. Yuck!

Tried to eat here last night.  Was pretty full.  The hostess sat us in the back room which usually isn't a problem.  We waited almost 7 minutes and i then asked the hostess if we had a server. She said she would find out who it was.  After waiting another 5 minutes no one showed up and the hostess didn't return to let us know she had notified our server. In the mean time the hostess had sat 2 other tables in the back room. I guess business is so good they don't care if people leave. oh, she did thank us on our way out!

Went for brunch/lunch with my family... We opted for the Bellagio over the Wynn based on the reviews. We arrived at 1100 and finally got through the long line around 1200. I was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness, huge variety of the food, and drinks. There is a little bit of everything from meats, pastas, seafood, salads, pizzas, breads, fruits, breakfast items (omlet station, pancakes/waffles, warm maple syrup, thick slabs of bacon, red potatoes, and sausage-SO YUMMY!!!!) and desserts!!! Champage/mimosas were optional for a small extra charge and the orange juice tasted like it was freshly squeezed. My favorites were the large cocktail shrimp, prime rib, ham, turkey, sea bass/salmon, coos coos, sushi, eggs bennidict, and the best cherry danishes that I've ever had!!!! The fresh fruit was amazingly sweet and ripe especially the strawberries, cantaloupe, and watermelon. The waitress was attentive and checked on our table often. We tried everything and I wasn't disappointed with anything. My daughter is 8 and can be a picky eater, but even she was in  pure heavan with the selections. For 3 people we spent $98.00 and it was worth every penny!!! We'll defiantly be back!

My daughter had the best time here! The all-day wrist band is the way to go for kids and adults! There wasn't any lines on a Friday night and the kiddo got on all the rides over and over! There is a indoor roller coaster that is worth riding a few times but we stayed away from the water ride because you literally got soaked on it! The bumper cars are fun and my daughter was tall enough to drive her own for the first time! It's a nice break from the strip and the touristy sightseeing- its a place that kids can let loose and burn some energy! The rides are fun for even adults, but bring your Tylenol because I had a headache after the 3rd time on the roller coaster!!!The workers are enthusiastic/friendly, and they do not hassle you to play games like at the carnivals or theme parks!

I love this church. Me and my husband did not know where we could meet people our own age and were looking for fellowship and people to do life with who loved Jesus Christ. I am 22 and he is 26. We were invited to the Maddox's redemption community on Tuesday nights and it was an answer to prayer. Lots of young people we could connect with, learn about the Bible, and ask questions. This church is all about Jesus, enough said. :)

I absolutely love this place. My husband has been coming here practically since it opened and it is the freshest, tastiest, fast Mexican food out there. The ambience is casual but the customer service is exceptional as the staff always asks me to have a seat and brings menus as if it were a sit-down restaraunt. Fajitas are out of this world but I find I can't stop myself from ordering the nachos the past several times I have been. Their red and green salsa is delicious (very important) and they even have an actually spicy hot sauce instead of a wimpy excuse for hot sauce that most places have. The owner works hard to keep this place with a friendly, mom and pop vibe that I think keeps patrons like us coming back again and again.

Attended there sponsored Yoga at the Zoo and let me tell you I was extremely disappointed. Unless you tailgated down by the fish tanks..you were not going to do yoga with the instructor! My friends and I were placed on the balcony where we could not see or hear anything. We were told to get as close to the person next to you as you can.. Not sure how that is relaxing when I almost got kicked in the face during downward dog! The two women at top did their best to try to make up their own yoga class, but I am almost POSITIVE it was different from what they were doing below! I don't know if someone was money hungry or what.. But they definitely OVERSOLD tickets. Would love to do it again as long as they only sold a limited amount of tickets! Cool idea at least!

Normally my fiancé and I love this place but last night our experience was so terrible that I doubt we will return any time soon! First off I felt like we had gone back in time to a high school dance! All of the waitresses were paying more time chatting about the boy working in the kitchen then checking on their guests! Second we ordered the homemade chips and salsa! Let me tell you the chips were definitely from a bag or they were old! Their was nothing homemade about them! And last but not least we normally visit this place for their delicious wings but they were far from delicious this time! The wings were not cooked all the way and were missing the sauces! After it took 20 minutes to get our waitresses attention,
we decided to get them to go and ended up cooking them ourselves at home! Poor experience will also share this with family who visits frequently!

I was really disappointed by this place. Other than its location, Luca doesn't have much going for it. Even the bread and seasoned olive oil weren't good. The arugula salad was sour and bland, the gnocchi, bland and over-sauced, the shrimp was chewy and didn't taste fresh. It was so loud my husband and I couldn't hear each other (but we could hear the people shouting at tables nearby). The room was so steamy you couldn't even enjoy the view because the windows were opaque with steam. The service was very good, but that just isn't enough. Save your money.

I scheduled my appointment in advance, woke up early to prepare my donation (which was sizable and full of expensive furniture, housewares, dvds, pots/pans, etc.) and when I hadn't heard from the driver by 9:30 called to find out what was going on.  They had no record of my appointment, were completely unapologetic about the error, and offered only to reschedule for 5 days later, when I would already be moving out of my apartment.  Even after both my husband and I implored them that we had a confirmed appointment and this stuff was too valuable to be thrown away and could they please add us to the schedule, they were dismissive, rude, nonchalant, and took absolutely no responsibility for their mistake.  We have rescheduled with another charity and will never donate to or shop at Salvation Army again.  This was a deplorable experience.  Hopefully all of these negative reviews will force them to reconsider how they do business.

This place is exceptional! Beyond the extraordinary food (creative recipes, fresh dishes, beautiful presentation, exciting flavors, new twists on standards) the service is warm, friendly, professional, and all of the people I met there were really cool and nice. Green beans are generally my least favorite vegetable (on account of them being boring and flavorless) but somehow they made green beans that made me actually gasp with pleasure! They were extremely accommodating of my vegetarianism (made me special flat-breads without meat). When I ate the Brussels sprouts I may have shed a few tears when it occurred to me that I couldn't continue to eat them for the remaining moments of my lifetime. 

Summary: Go to here. Eat many food.

First time here and really impressed with the pizza! I got the Diavalo with no meat and it exceeded my expectations. The crust is thin and buttery and the wood fire flavor is smoky and delightful! The ingredients were really fresh and I thought the pizza was well thought out with the garlic complimenting the spicy peppers and olives. The restaurant is small so plan ahead. Definitely will go back.

I went to Olio with my mom for lunch while I was home visiting for the holidays. We loved the cozy and comfortable atmosphere. The staff was attentive and friendly. We liked Dale, the bartender. He had such a great attitude, very refreshing from some other bartenders around Pit that aren't as kind and welcoming. I loved their drink selection, including the wine list and specialty cocktails. The bar menu was very affordable. I heard that they do 1/2 price wine on Wednesday, I would definitely bring my girlfriends here for a causal night out. 

We enjoyed the Antipasto for an appetizer. It was delicious! The bean dip was killer! And the bread served was soft and yummy. We split a chicken salad and prosciutto arugula pizza. The salad was fresh, the dressing was perfect and chicken was grilled to perfection. The pizza was yummy, it's crust was soft and doughy. It was a delicious spin off a traditional non-brick oven style pizza. Next time I want to try a pasta dish because it all looked so good and great portions too. This is definitely a restaurant that values using fresh and simple ingredients with nice traditional touches.

I really enjoyed everything during my visit to Olio. I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends. It's finally nice to find a causal and comfortable restaurant with friendly people, good service and great food at an affordable price.

Great atmosphere! Owners Frank & Alicia treat you like a guest in their home. Happy hour 7 days a week! (I almost don't want to share what a gem this place is, so I can keep it to myself.) The meatball sliders are amazing, and there's a pork chop with polenta on the Happy Hour menu for only $7!! My parents are regulars here now, and I can see why. If I lived closer I would be too! 

All in all, a great place for homemade Italian dishes (and desserts) that is perfect for the area!

Today was our second visit to 'The Egg I Am' on a Sunday. We arrived around 9:00AM and not a bad wait to be seated, 30 minutes. The complimentary coffee is a nice perk to have available while waiting. Once seated, it took 30 minutes for our food to arrive (during both visits). It has been over 6 weeks or more since they have been open and it is a shame that at both visits it took over 30 minutes for our food ticket, of just breakfast food. This is a lack of prep in the kitchen. Owners please take note and work on the kitchen staff to speed up the times. The apples in the apple pancake were raw. They fell out of the pancake. The eggs were great the first visit and were cooked just right. Today, the eggs were runny and were not hot. The bacon was cold too. I just do not see a 3rd visit in my future.

The Gault is a wonderful destination.  My fiance and I stayed for Valentine's day weekend 2012.  We picked what could have been one of the coldest weekends all winter to visit Montreal, but due to the cozy warmth of our home-away-from-home at the Gault we felt so comfortable!  

The room was lovely, we had a loft basic package and really enjoyed the heated floor and cute door overlooking the street.  The bed is super soft and really a nice complement to the modern look of the room.  There's turn down service and cookies provided daily.  The location of the hotel in Old Montreal could not have been better - it's perfect for walking through the area and very close to the waterfront.

We took part in the spa package offered through the website with the Scandinavian baths and really enjoyed the experience.  Our massages were great and the price was reasonable and cheaper than what we would have paid on our own.

I emailed the concierge ahead of time to request a special wine and snack celebratory surprise for my fiance and they were so helpful.  The entire request was provided to perfection and right on time.  I would highly recommend working with the concierge as the recommendations for dinner and jazz club were completely on-point.

I've given 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple of reasons: the price is still a bit high for what you get, the breakfast is not included in the room rate although we were told it would be upon check in, and the gym is adequate but quite small.

Intimate seating and sexy lighting... fantastic live music... a host who helps you find seating by artfully rearranging other patrons and a cover of only $6.  So what if my scotch pour was a tad stingy - this place has it all!!  

This is the perfect locale for a nightcap post dinner at L'Express (easy walk, even in heels and in 5degree F weather!) or to round off a hot first date.  I highly recommend checking it out - only don't tell anyone else, or next time I'm in Montreal there may be no room for me!

The manager had such an attitude , the manager "Mandy price "was talking so rudely to me for some one who has spent numerous amounts of money with them for mainly one of my dogs. She seemed like she didn't care about me as a customer at all, I work with customers all day and never would I have an attitude as hers. She made me feel like my money should have went some where else . I was expecting a more professional manager who would be a role model to her fellow workers . The two front desk people had better manors then she did, They should be her manager maybe she can take some tips on basic human communication 101.

We order the sample platter for 2, and it was way too much food. Perhaps we are not accustomed to eating BBQ in such quantities, but we hardly made a dent. The variety was very good to sample each of the meats that are offered, as well as two sides. Meats included full rack of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, meat loaf and chicken. We started with the ribs, and while  happy with the portion, I must say that I was disappointed in the meat itself. I'm not sure if they were baby back ribs, but they tasted more like side ribs, and were kind of dry. I am not a BBQ expert, so maybe real BBQ ribs are not supposed to be moist, but if juicy is wrong, then I don't want to be right! The rest of the platter was decent. The sides were probably my favorite part of the meal. We got fries, coleslaw and potato salad. I love sides in general, and all of the sides were excellent. The fries were crispy but not overly crunchy, the coleslaw was creamy and sour, but not too creamy, and the potato salad, topped with some paprika, was one of the best that I've had. There are also two bottles of house BBQ sauce on the table that you can add to your meats; I dumped it in massive amounts all over. The spicy one is pretty good, with some kick but not overbearing. I didn't not try the mild one. 

There are two parts of the meal that are my focus: the sides (as mentioned above), and condiments, including any sauces or little extras that add to the meal. Many times, I can even forgo the main. In this case, I could definitely go back just for the sides and call it a meal.

Came here really wanting to like it since it's relatively close to home, but I was quite disappointed. The prices were very high for what we got. 

While I do enjoy fusion, particularly Japanese fusion, this aspect was not well executed here. They served some spicy tuna on a Pringles chip and another concoction on a nacho chip... Perhaps that night they were short on tuna but all I could taste were the chips. Not good. 

Also, we had a billing issue that the waitress and manager could not resolve so she consulted with the owner. Instead of coming over to talk to us, he simple said no and sent her back to us without an explanation. We always try to be gracious to waitstaff when there are problems with the billing because I believe that it is the establishment's responsibility, and so we told her that the bill is wrong but we will pay it to save her the trouble. But overall, this showed poor customer service on the owner's part.

I agree with the precious review; many of the dishes were not not available when I came in. I was told that I would have to wait 5 minutes for most of the dishes to come out, so I did. 10 minutes later, I was still waiting. Eventually someone noticed I was still waiting, apologized and offered me a free drink. I ended up getting the orange chicken, walnut shrimp and mandarin beef (crispy beef). The food was not that bad, typical Chinese takeout, but a little healthier. I think that the fried rice was brown rice. Note that the walnut shrimp is considered a premium item and has an additional charge. 

While I don't have complaints about the servers, the manager of the place did act very professionally. With an open kitchen, customers can watch their food being cooked and any interactions in the kitchen. That day, the manager reprimanded one of the cooks; not only did this slow down the food being prepared, but it was unprofessional. As I watched, I felt very bad for the guy; he was only one of two cooks, and from the time that I got there, he was cooking fast and hard. I think that Panda Express needs to hire more cooks to have food ready to go, as they are a fast food/ take out restaurant, and consider better training for their managers.

My favorite place for Vietnamese food! 

We like to get the bo bay mon (7 beef courses) ($25), and the family combo (canh chua - soup, ca kho - braised catfish, and goi kho bo - papaya beef jerky salad) ($20). They also have a seafood hotpot, with fish, squid, and veggies with a sour broth - very GOOD for under $25. Banh xeo is also quite good. 

Vietnamese comfort food, at an affordable price. Very good service as well.

My SO and I have been trying expand our food horizon and try new cuisines. Inspired by our recent trip to Khao San Road, we ventured over to Lion City for a different South East Asian type of food. We ordered two noodle soups, the laksa and another soup that had two different types of noodles in it  (don't remember the name). I was anticipating bold flavors, but was disappointed. The laksa was a little to coconutty for me, and did not seem to have any other seasonings (save for some satay on the side).

Despite this, I chose to give a 3-star rating because of the service. The servers there are very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was very warm and welcoming. I think that I would go back just for the atmosphere here.

There are 3 types of tacos that I have had here in Toronto: Taco Bell, Mexican tacos and fusion tacos. This is a Mexican taco place. 

They have a variety items on their menu but we only tried the tacos - beef tongue, fish and carne asada. All were excellent, full of flavor, and spicy. I like my tacos very spicy, and often times, its not quite spicy enough, but here, the hot sauce really packed some punch. 

The beef tongue was tender and flavorful. The fish taco was fried, the batter was good, not falling off of the fish like many places. The carne asada taco was not as good as the first two, but still enjoyable. All 3 tacos had pico de gallo , carne asada had pickled cabbage. 

My favorite was the beef tongue. I was very apprehensive about it at first, because I've seen raw beef tongue before... its not pretty, but now, I look for restaurants that serve it. I have yet to find one as good. 

Unfortunately, I drove by a few times and the windows are blacked out, so I assume that they have since closed.

I was apprehensive about going to Agio for dinner but agreed since we did not have a dinner destination and I hate driving around looking for a random restaurant. As we walked in, I was immediately doubtful of my agreeableness. Not only was the restaurant empty, there was an Asian man mopping, and he looked to be the chef. He quickly greeted us, told us to sit anywhere and brought us some hot green tea. At this point I was confused - green tea with pasta? But we went on anyway because he was actually very friendly, and I felt like I just walked into my uncle's house. 

We ordered the butternut squash ravioli and the osso bucco. After ordering, the chef disappeared a while. When he returned, he had two bowls of butternut squash soup and some garlic bread. While it was a little bland, I enjoyed the warm soup on a cold day, and appreciated the complimentary amuse-bouche while we waited. 

Not long after, our mains were served and I must say I was impressed. My SO's osso bucco was accompanied with vegetables and some penne pasta, while my bowl had 4 large ravioli in a rosé sauce, which was perfectly cooked. While I am not a pasta expert, I believe that the ravioli was made fresh and in house. The pasta itself was slightly chewy, with a generous amount of butternut squash in between. The sauce was a little overwhelming but I swept some of it to the side, which the bf gladly soaked up with the garlic bread. The osso bucco was also delicious; the veggies were cooked well, as was the pasta. But the star of the dish was the veal. The marrow was a nice treat to spread on the garlic toast (and on its own), and the meat itself was soft, tender, and well-seasoned. We ended the meal with complimentary tiramisu, which was excellent. 

Overall, Agio has a homey atmosphere, with delicious food. While small and easily missed, it is worth it to give it a try. Don't let the ethnicity of the chef deter you; as others have mentioned, he lived and was trained in Italy for many years.

Had the Drake burger, which was on promo for their 10 year anniversary. I thought that the burger was pretty good; I really liked the cheese and the bacon was very smokey and flavorful. I really like the bun - it was slightly chewy and toasted with butter. Also came with a pickle. 

What really stood out were the fries that came with the combo. I believe that the fries were twice fried with sea salt. I am definitely a fries girl and these were one of the best! I probably wouldn't pay full price for the burger ($19), but perhaps I would might just to have the fries.

We came for the soft opening, so we knew that it might not the same experience expected from Guu. 

We were quickly seated at the bar, and noticed that there was a strong hot air draft where we were seated. It was very hard to breathe and my eyes were getting dry but this was quickly turned off when the waiter noticed that I was trying to find the source of hot air. Sign of good customer service. 

We ordered a variety of items on the menu including smoked monkfish liver, beef tongue and many different skewers. I really enjoyed the monkfish liver - it was actually my favorite dish of the night. The beef tongue was okay, a little chewy but good flavors. Very smokey. Upon tasting the first skewers that came out, my boyfriend commented on the temperature of the grill, that it wasn't hot enough. While I don't know much about grilling or temperatures, I trust his judgement in this area. As we received the rest of our skewers, each one had more char, and better flavor and texture. 

Of the skewers we ordered, my favorites were the liver, pork cheek, and pork belly. My least favorite was the sasami or chicken tenderloin; I found it a little dry and not enough flavor. 

I believe that there is great potential here at kintori, and will eventually live up to the standards set by its Guu counterpart.

Choose 2 is the perfect portion size for me! And I get to try out different things on the menu. While quite pricey, and can be replicated at home at a fraction of the cost, its a nice place to spend a few hours with friends catching up, or studying. 

You are pretty safe ordering most of the items on the menus, except for the mushroom soup. I was under the impression that it was a cream of mushroom soup, but it was far from what I had expected. It was more sour and strange, so I couldn't finish it. Before I ordered, I did ask to confirm that it was cream of mushroom soup, but upon tasting, I think that it had more of a wine base than cream base. Maybe my taste buds are not refined enough, and the soup is actually good? I'm not sure.

Good even on a cold winter day!

I'm not sure how it is possible but the cookies are soft and chewy, but also crunchy. Ice cream is very creamy and not icy at all. My favorite combination is the ginger molasses cookie with dulce de leche ice cream. I am not looking forward to summer, when I am sure there will be huge lineups!

Probably one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants that I've been to. As mentioned, on the weekends, you can order sweet shrimp sashimi. At first, I was apprehensive about ordering it because I've had bad sweet shrimp at non-AYCE places, however, it was very fresh and good size (sometimes, sushi places have tiny, tiny "sweet shrimps"). 

Everything else on the menu was enjoyable, with very good portion sizes - small enough that you have the opportunity to try multiple items. For example, the rolls come in 4's, so you can try more than one roll. Another plus was the dessert. They have black sesame ice cream, which I've never seen at AYCE sushi before, along with other jellos (black current and litchi), mango pudding and a chef's special. 

While pricey, $24.99 on the weekends, I would say that its worth it.

When we go out to eat, my SO and I like to order different meals so that we can sample a variety of foods from the restaurant. In particular to sushi restaurants, I usually get some raw fish and my SO gets a bento with cooked foods. 

Here at Sushi House, I ordered the salmon chirashi and he got a bento. The bento was not too special but the chirashi was very good. The rice was well seasoned, with a  generous portion of salmon, along with other little condiments on the side like marinated mushrooms and pickled radish. After the first time, I always order the same thing. 

The owners and chef are Korean and so the sushi is a bit different from Japanese or Chinese sushi.

We came here for lunch on a Friday. Upon first impression, we noted the large space, high ceilings and modern decor. The service was hit-or-miss. Some of the servers were friendly, and attentive, while others just tossed our food on the table and walked away, ignoring all inquiries. 

As for the food, I was very impressed by the soup. We had hot and sour soup, and ordered a second one, it was that good. Other than that, there is nothing special about the food. The salmon sushi didn't taste very fresh, but I did enjoy the seaweed on the handrolls.

I have recently discovered the Chatime on Dundas, and have become a fan. I usually get the grass jelly roasted milk tea. This location was very busy for a cold and wet Monday afternoon, with about 15 people ahead of us. The drink was consistent with the Dundas location. I would probably avoid this location because it is so busy, but without the line, and if I was in the area, I would be there.

The tempura was very good, particularly the lobster tempura - very reasonably priced too. They also have monkfish liver sushi, which I always appreciate; good portion and tastes great!

When eating tacos, I like to have a good hot sauce on the side. Cantina definitely delivered in this respect. On the table, there are two hot sauces, the red one, chipotle based, and the green one, SPICY! 

We ordered the octopus taco, fish taco and the LA truck taco. The combination of flavors worked very well. Each was enjoyable but the octopus was particularly good. I'm not sure how they cook it, but it was soft and flavorful. We also have the ceveche and plated chorizo burrito. The ceveche was not what I expected; I could have used some more salt and lime. The burrito was quite good, and unique. It had a fried egg on top, along with many sauces. 

The reason for 3-star rating is mainly because of the price. With so many other fusion taco places around now, changing $5+ for a taco seems to be a bit steep.

Those i***** advertise a free written quote on their website, so I filled out the online form, got a confirmation email with a lot of things that I certainly did not select. After almost 2 hours later instead of the written quote or an email requesting further info I received a call from a technician. On top of that they wanted to charge me $125 for opening the door of my mainstream car during daytime. I'll pass, thanks for nothing.

Had to look for a towing company when my starter broke down. Based on the other yelp reviews I checked their website and found things to be very transparent. They were busy on that Sunday (May-Pac weekend. Eventually Ryan came with a big towing truck shortly after the scheduled time. He knows what he's doing and we had a great conversation. Very reasonable charge for the job. I will use them again when I need my car to get towed again.

I have contacted Dewain by email with some questions about getting my Stratus tinted and he quickly got back to me.

I made an appointment, drove up to him, showed up a bit earlier and he started to work on my car immediately.

By watching him I can definitely tell he knows what he's doing.

The result looks great (5% limo for the back windows, 20% for the doors), he took his time and did a careful job.

He used quality film and charged me a very competitive price. Will contact him again if I need to get another car tinted.

I went on a Saturday around 4pm. Apart from me there was just a family of 3, but given the time and the fact that the intersection Tropicana/Spencer is maybe not the most popular, I guess it's not too unusual. I received a very warm welcome by the Russian waitress. The place itself is quite large with a stage  area as well as a bar section. It's a bit darkish and quite cozy, but your mileage may vary.

Because I wasn't really hungry but I wanted to check out the restaurant anyway, I just had the JULIEN (mushrooms in cream sauce and cheese), the SOLYANKA (typical Russian soup with good chunks of sausage) as well as the NAPOLEON cake. 

I found all things to be very tasty.

I liked their homemade KVAS as well. A little bit of a warning, even though KVAS is supposed to have like 1% alcohol, after a few refills I did feel something. This is no criticism, just to warn those who are not supposed to drink any alcohol at all.

I'll be back soon to try their main courses.

Worst meal ever. Beans & rice had a sour taste. My husband ordered a plate w/a tostada, enchilada, & taco. They were sampler size at a price of $9.95. We told the waiter & they reduced our bill 20% but they really didn't care what was wrong. We could have eaten at Taci Bell & had better tasting food for a lot less and regular sized food insread of minis. Even the iced tea was small size. Never going back.

The food was okay BUT while I was there, one of the waitresses spilt dirty leftover juice from cleaning another table over the seat of my friend's back. The liquid soaked up her dress, bag and jacket. After the incident none of the servers came to apologize and/or offer any sort of compensation for ruining my friends belongings. At most we were met with complete indifference by the staff and some paper towels to dry her stuff off. Additionally, our dishes were suppose to come with egg but did not. When we asked, they said they had run out but failed to tell us beforehand. 

The service here was extremely disappointing. I normally do not write yelp reviews but wanted to warn people about the service.

I don't know what the food tastes like here because after being seated in a seat in front of the door (which was freezing as it is winter), and waiting half an hour for our food, we chased the same waitress about our order twice (she didn't get back to us at the first time). After the second time, we were asked to reorder because apparently our order was never entered. When we confronted the waiter who took our order, he denied ever even taking it. If you like being served by waiting staff that excel in staring at you blankly, this place is perfect for you.

We left before reordering in both anger and dire hunger.  The service here is quite poor, I am never going again and would not recommend it to anyone.

Attentive and friendly service from beginning to end. Ordered the fresh rolls (vegetarian), basil beef with fried egg, and pad kee mao (aka drunken noodles). The fresh rolls were a mix of veggies and mango served with tamarind and peanut dipping sauces. Not exceptional, but decent. The pad kee mao was quite good - slight hit of spice without being overwhelming, and the noodles weren't overly oily as other reviewers are complaining (maybe that's a pad thai problem?). The basil beef with egg was amazing. Not as spicy as it would have been in Thailand (most Canadians are spice wimps so I don't blame them for toning it down, although you can request spicier or mild) but excellent and authentic flavor. The egg was also a highlight - fried to airy crispiness on the edges but still with a runny yolk to break over the rice.  Portion sizes were just right, the prices were very reasonable (at the low end for Toronto Thai restaurants), and there's a discount for paying with cash. Glad to have another good Thai restaurant in the neighborhood.

I just renewed my warranty for $725.00. I went to change my filter in my AC and it was dripping wet.  MY Policy states, the AC/heater unit is covered under the warranty. When i called OneGuard the young man said. " OH, WE DO NOT COVER  BLOWING OUT CONDENSATION LINES."  iF YOU GO THROUGH US, YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE $70.00 ONEGUARD FEE AND PAY PRIVATELY TO THE COMPANY FOR BLOWING OUT YOUR LINES.  I said' Well, that would be stupid of me, I'll just call someone myself'. Which is what I did. Cost of $125.00. My complaint is; I pay over $700 to cover, or thought my AC unit was covered, my home as listed on the list provided by ONEGuard including AC/heater. NOW, ONEGUARD tells me. OH No we don't cover that.  Have you all seen that warranty commercial about the ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE?  That's OneGuard.  I am sorry I renewed.  I might as well put that $700.00 in the bank and use it toward repairs, I have to pay additional anyway.  ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE?

I only lived there for 6 months and yes, it had some cons, but I still I liked it there. First the cons..
My cons: 
1. My apartment didn't have a balcony, which I would have loved. ..but I knew that when I signed my lease.
2. After the carpet stains began resurfacing after their pre move in cleaning, it was FILTHY. Def should've been replaced. I couldn't walk barefoot in my own home. And grouping in w the carpet..the cabinets were horribly scratched. .. which only began to show, again, after the pre move in treatment wore off.
3. This is a big one. ... BUGS. When the weather began to heat up, they made their presence known. I know it's Vegas and bugs happen no matter how nice the area . but I HATE them.  *shudders* 
Pros:
1. They spray often and any time you need them to spray indoors, they're there. As well as maintenance. 
2. The area and the neighbors were nice. Very quiet. 
3. Nice, big pool area
4. Different layout. Nice, open space. And I love, LOVE all the windows! I think that was my favorite. I love all the natural light. I didn't have to use any lights til it got dark outside. And the location of my apartment added to all of that. Corner unit w mountain views. 
 5. The staff. From the women in the office to the maintenence guys..all nice and friendly. Esp Jill with perky her voice and attitude! 

I would live there again. .. in a unit w a balcony :-)

This store has so many flip flops to choose from it was hard to pick out just one pair. I was a little upset with one of the workers in there trying to get me to buy the smaller size rather than the size that fit my foot.

This is my first Yelp review, and I'm usually quite lazy about things like this, but I believe Dr. Perez deserves to be recognized.  As a physician myself, I am very particular about whom I see for health care.  

Prior to moving to Arizona, I was affiliated with University hospitals, and saw only physicians I personally knew to be excellent, often leaders in their fields.  However, after moving to AZ awhile back, I did not have the connections or the knowledge of the local health care professionals to afford me this luxury.

I found Dr. Perez to be the epitome of professionalism both in terms of competence and bedside manner.   

His office, internet portal, and staff are all top notch, which I consider secondary to competence and bedside manner, but it sure makes things more pleasant.

I arrived 2 hours early for my appointment due to my own mistake, and I was fit in between patients within 15 minutes.  Despite this, my visit with Dr. Perez was thorough, which is difficult these days given the time restraints primary care physicians often face.


5 stars all the way.

Can't recommend this business enough.

Michelle takes pride in her business and it shows.

Bob was professional, courteous and most importantly skilled.

Will be using this business for all future needs.  Bob, as long as he's available, is our guy.

Dr. Villarreal is a superb doctor who takes her time to truly examine and diagnose/treat her patients, which is quite rare in medicine these days.  

Not sure about the other reviews complaining about support staff and wait times, as my son was seen promptly and the whole office was very professional.  Perhaps these were incidents that transpired secondary to the thoroughness of the diagnostic work up; this is something to applaud not criticize IMHO.  

Some cases are straightforward but others are more complex and you cannot always guarantee a quick 10 minute exam will cure what ails you.  Although this can be frustrating, I'd prefer to have a physician take their time rather than churn through a list of patients to maximize profits and reduce wait times so they can get a better yelp review.  It's your health not a cheeseburger.

When it's your turn, you can be assured that your issue will be addressed properly.

I went to the shop and previously had given them a 5 star from an issue I was having over the summer. I just moved from MN and my car was overheating. I took my car to the shop and explained the situation. They are very nice but that does not mean that the advice they gave me was right. They played the guessing game with the car looking at the water pump, temp sensor, thermostat, which were all options. They had told me that they had ruled out a blown head gasket, which I was pretty sure was not the issue as I was not leaking coolant anywhere and never needed to fill up.

After being there almost a week they had asked me if they could take it to another shop, but would have to charge me because they were being charged. I agreed and the diagnostic came back as a blown head gasket. I found this odd and they texted me a picture of the diagnostic, which showed that they actually were not charged for the service. They had quoted me that it would be $3,100 to get it fixed, which also seemed really high. I paid the $90 diagnostic and picked my car up 7 days after delivering it.

I was going through a bit of a cash flow problem and limited my driving and washed the temperature. I noticed as the temperature started to cool recently, the car would have to be under extreme stop and go traffic or if I had my a/c on low the temp would rise to the 3/4 mark.

Yesterday I took my car to another guy. He quickly determined a few issues that were causing my problem. He stated the radiator was not operating properly and the radiator fans were working intermittently, as well as they were weak when actually operating. He did this from his house. New radiator, new radiator fan motor, transmission flush, and labor it cost me $550. I put my car through a test today driving around for an hour in stop and go traffic and blasting the a/c...... the problem has been fixed. 

SO the company that did the diagnostic? I thought this was a GM dealership as he had stated, I checked with the 2 dealerships within a few miles of their shop, my car was not taken to either one of them. They also stated that a blown head gasket at their shop would only run about $2,200. That was at a dealership and was $900 cheaper than this place. Plus they did not take it to either dealership, so I am not sure where they took it for the $90 they charged me and of course was a wrong diagnostic.

The trust factor with this place is now gone. I felt I should update my findings as I previously appreciated their due diligence, but now feel a bit ripped off. Thank goodness it only cost me $90 to learn my lesson.

That was just my experience

I work at the property, so to be fair and transparent. The food is great, my daughter and I go there twice a month (like I said, I work at the property and I eat there with clients more often). This place is not owned or operated by GVR, so there is no reason to boast if they failed. The staff is always great. They are polite and helpful and always treat my daughter well.

Ordered food for delivery and all 3 meals were missing items. Both pitas were missing sides and dressing for salad was incorrect. When I called to get corrected they offered to have me drive over to pick it up.  Not  cool when I already paid for delivery. Instead of offering help the owner was just rude and hung up. Never ordering from here again.

Did a fine job on the suit I guess.  Issue with them is that I told them I needed an item back by a certain day and time and they promised it would be ready. I even allowed 24 hours extra and told them I needed it one day earlier than I did just in case they screwed up.  Showed up 1 day after they promised and guess what? No suit.  I had to wear a dirty suit to the wedding.  They added insult to injury by charging me FULL price for it in spite of their screw up.  

Stay clear of these bozos.

I have stayed at this hotel many times, but I think it's declined significantly lately.  This stay... Where to start?  Stayed here on business.  I Booked a King Room with a "canyon" view and showed up at the hotel about 10 minutes later since I booked it from the shopping center across the street. 

After waiting almost 20 minutest to check in since there was only 1 person working at the counter at what I'm assuming is the "peak" check in time of 445pm, was told there were no King non smoking rooms but they'd be happy to put in in a smoking king... Whatever, give me the queen rooms and no biggie, you'd think.  

The room over looked not a canyon but a beautiful parking structure and the I215 behind it which actually made plenty of noise.  To make matters worse when I pulled the covers back there was so much dust that came off the bed spread it looked like a cloud.

Last straw was getting charged the $30 resort fee and being told they had a "state of the art fitness center" included in this, I found the fitness center under renovation and closed.  It was replaced by a conference room with 5 treadmills and TV with no remote control. Seriously?  Fraudulent!! 

Never staying again!

If I could give this POS company negative stars I would.  They are awful.  I was stuck with them for a few months and they are the worst.  I agree with other reviewers that most of the morons they send out are right out of high school. The guy at my house was either high or retarded.  Probably both. I watched what they do each time they were here and it's a joke. They left trash in my yard.  The reason they are cheap is that they only balance chemicals 2x per month and in the AZ summer that wont work.  My new pool guy says "half of my current customers came from Poolman" and they left because Poolman sucks.  I wouldn't trust them to sevice a cess pool.  Run away from this company.

Well I never Lived Here. But I got a really nice look at the place when I tracked my stolen iPhone To an apartment there.  You have to love the find my iPhone app! You could see it was in one specific section of the apartments... The police was nice enough to come out and knock on the doors, However most of the people who live there simply turn off the lights and didn't answer the door.  It's that kind of friendly place. So here's what you do if you want to live with people who will steal somebody's iPhone from a clothing store Changing room, Definitely move there.

I have kept trying and trying to give this place a decent shot but they keep giving me a reason to never, ever go back.  

Tonight I went at 645 PM and the meat and deli counter were already closed?  I mean, WTF? People DO go shopping at 645PM still right?  I asked the cashier and she said "Well, we are just too slow to keep the meat counter open this late."  Seriously?  No wonder why this place is slowly dying. 

The selection here has been gradually getting worse, now no organic chicken, and outside of the closed meat counter their meat selection quite frankly sucks unless you want to buy a bunch of clearly past their prime pre packaged meat some of which is marked down a whopping $3.  Thanks Haggens, enjoy throwing that piece of Kobe beef out instead of discounting it. 

I will be looking forward to this place going out of business but I feel bad for their employees.  It's not their fault the managers are idiots

I am very happy we went to see Duke at Your Mattress.  We went to both his Fashion Square store and also the Arcadia store and he is truly an expert in what he sells.  In addition he had a tremendous amount of patience with us as we really didn't know what we wanted.  He has a system there that estimates the exact firmness of the mattress that suits you the most and it was really accurate.  

The store is really nice, and his delivery people were very clean and professional. 

In addition, the Kingsdown mattresses he carries seem very well made, and there are multiple different options that should make everyone happy. 

Highly recommended!!!!

I just arrived home from shopping at Zara.  Store # 6422, Fashion Square Mall, Scottsdale, Arizona.Tonight was the worst experience ever there!  I am a regular Zara Customer having shopped in Chicago, California, and Arizona locations for 8 years now.  This evening, I was shopping in the store for a total of 20 minutes from start to finish.  From the moment I walked trough the door this evening, not one sales associate said a word to me.  No one helped us!  My daughter and I made quick selections for her to try on because we needed something specific, and she headed towards the dressing room.  It was 8:57 at that moment, when the cashier, Maria Marte, was the first person in the entire time I was there to say anything to me.  Here is what she said, "We are closed."  I replied, "Its 3 minutes to closing, you aren't closed yet, my daughter wants to try 3 blouses on, and then we should be able to make a purchase quickly."  The cashier at Zara, Fashion Square replied to me, "Well I'm closing my register."  

At 9:02 pm, the cashier Maria Marte turned to me and said, "I'm closing my register.".  I said in return, "We are going to make a purchase, my daughter is finishing up in the dressing room."  Where in she stated, "Well we are closed."  I said, "You won't let us make a purchase?"  Maria the cashier then said, "Well my manager said to go ahead and close my register."  I asked to speak to the store manager, because this didn't seem right. It was no way to treat a customer who is trying to make a purchase at 2 minutes after 9:00 pm

At that moment, the assistant store manager came over to us.  His name is Ruben Sanchez.  Ruben turned to me and said, "We are closed."  I said, I realize this, but we are about to make a purchase.  He then said, "Well our registers are closing."  I looked at my watch and said, "It's 4 minutes after, won't you give us some grace and let us make a purchase?"  Ruben the assistant store manager at the Scottsdale, AZ store turned to the cashier and said, "Close it down."  Then walked away from me.  I said to Maria the Cashier, "I come 9 years out of Retail Sales, and have worked for Nordstrom and Barney's New York.  This is never an attitude that a sales associate should have towards a customer that would like to make a purchase.  Generally, at 9:00 pm closing you close the front door, but let any customers still in the store at that time finish out their transaction, make the purchase, then allow them to leave.  This is within a reasonable amount of time, it's 9:06 now."  Maria the cashier then said, "Well my manager told me to close the register."  I replied, "Even if that means you won't allow me to make a purchase."  She said, "Yes."  After begging them to take my money, I finalized my transaction at 9;06 pm, with purchasing a white blouse my daughter had selected.  I don't think I could ever shop at the Zara Scottsdale, Arizona ever again.  They treated me so meanly and made me feel as though I was being kicked out, when all I was doing was buying a blouse and being a loyal customer.

Rude staff!  I rented two patio umbrella propane heaters for an event.  They were late on delivery the day of the event.  Then on the scheduled pick-up time, post event, they were also late.  I waited at home for 3 hours for the scheduled pick-up.  30 minutes post time block, I called and asked their status, or to reschedule.  The gentleman on the other end told me that now they needed to charge me extra money for a specific time pick-up.  I replied, I don't need a specific time, I just was hoping that you would meet the schedule you had asked for on the equipment pick-up.  I advised that the heaters were on the patio where the delivery technician had placed them the day prior.   The gentleman at A to Z said that again they needed to charge me more money as a "set-up" charge to get them off my patio, where they had placed them originally.  He told me that they needed to be curb side.  So, I alone, had to carry them up a steep driveway, and they were quite heavy.  It was a struggle and massive to handle.  The customer service individuals at A to Z were rude to me and non-helpful.  All they wanted to do is stick me with charges above and beyond already set contract.  I will never use them again!

We contacted this company after reading the reviews here on Yelp.   The two gentlemen that did the move were very nice.   We had moved all breakable items, boxes, and small items beforehand ourselves.   Unfortunately for the guys doing the move it was over 120 degrees that day, and as such the move took longer then originally quoted.   Brad Olson was very good about only charging us for the agreed amount of time quoted.    I would certainly recommend this company based upon their customer service.

We contacted Arizona Rainfall for a proposal on remodeling a pool and entire backyard.  Tim Brown, son in law of the owner, was assigned to us.   Tim came out to look at the property and we gave him the plans for the pool that was installed as well as the Plot plan for the house.   We discussed what we wanted with Tim and left to draw an initial plan.   Days later Tim emailed a basic plan and a video of his ideas, So far So Good.   In the meantime we contacted a couple of much larger pool companies, including one that we had used before and has a very good reputation.   Its a good thing we did as the other companies check the codes and found setbacks restrictions that Tim was unaware of.   Due to the research of the other pool companies, we had Tim redraw the plan with those setbacks in mind, as well as some other ideas.   This happened on a number of plan iterations, where another pool company would have a great idea and we would share that idea with Tim to incorporate into our plan.   There were many differences in design quality such as AZ Rainfall uses Alumawood for their Ramadas as opposed to building from scratch like all other builders.   We informed Tim that we would have to check with our association as their rules required similar building materials as the original residence.   All of the sudden I get a call from Tim Brown saying they didn't have the time to send a final plan for approval by the HOA, without which we could not get approval.
It appears that this well over $100,000.00 job was no longer of interest to AZR.   I guess that the demand for pools and landscaping is strong enough that some builders that are not big enough to perform certain jobs find it easier at the last minute to withdraw, having wasted valuable client time.  So if you have a big job, and are a good buyer, you might want to go with a more experienced and larger pool/spa company.

Hello, 

Hello - Had the Beef vindaloo and it was great. Perfect meal for a snowy day in Calgary. The menu has some nice choices and the quality to price ratio is good. This is a chain restaurant that offers good service but if you travel a lot is just kinda what you get in all other chain restaurants, not that that is a bad thing it's just don't expect to be blown away for a 
culinary experience. It was in a nice new building just like all the other nice new buildings in that area. The service was very friendly, the meals came out fast and is exactly what I was wanted for my meeting.

I agree with the other posts that this company is not providing the service it advertises. When you try to reserve tickets, you can not get the flight you want, you still have to pay the taxes and they request to many points for what the segment is worth.

My other issue is the way the retire points for non activity. This is a punitive and self-service policy. They retired 360,000 miles from my account for non activity but yet they left the account open. I did not get any notice they were going to retire my points. 

I would like to see the appetite for a class action against Aeroplan. Any lawyers want a piece of this? If you had points retired, do you want to join? 

Why do they retire them? There is a financial benefit to the company to steal these points away from their members so the policy is clearly to their benefit and is punitive for their users.

Let me know, I am serious about this. I want to investigate if there is enough moment and content to open a national class lawsuit against them.

It's a hit or miss at this location. Sometimes the food is good and at others it's mediocre and the fish doesn't taste or smell  fresh. I always get the all you can eat buffet and the food is ok for the low pricing. However they don't have the best sushi and the servers are rude and kind of throw your food on the table. The only time they speak to you is when they bring out the debit machine for you to pay and they put a fake smile on for a tip. I once overheard the server raise her voice with the customer at the table next to us because he left her a low tip.

Special thanks goes out to Marie and Fiona! Definitely recommend this day care facility for anyone who is looking for a responsible kennel to leave their pets!!

My boyfriend and I have eaten here at least eight (8) times. Here's the scoop:  the veggie pizza is amazing, brushetta is fantastic, beet salad very tasty,  satay skewers are great, the avocado dip is flavorful, the arugula & friseè salad with pecans delish.  In short, every dish we have tried so far is done with a tasty twist.  They also have a great beer and wine selection.  The sorbet desserts are heavenly.  We will definitely be returning soon.

Wow, where to begin?  We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the "kitchen" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The "manager" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that "sure bet"!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen/management team just weren't ordering any food?  Wow, what a way to make a transition in business ownership!!! Someone please help these clueless owners/managers!!

My wife and I have been eating at this Zupa's (Happy Valley) for almost a year.  When we first started eating there it was absolutely excellent.  Our last few visits, today and last week were not good at all.  First off the salad bowl used to be filled almost to the top with greens, last two visits there were a good 1 1/2" from the top (really?) of course the condiments are alwyas put on with a tiny baby spoon, usually not even half full of content, but I get that and am ok with that, but what also doesn't seem right is that if you get a "large" size salad, you still get the small size condiments?  Additionally, the honey mustard dressing must have been diluted because it has absolutely no taste and of course was minimally applied.  Another major concern is that while eating the salad, it seemd very gritty, almost like there was sand or dirt on the leaves?  Bad taste as well.  I used to get the lobster bisque but quite ordering that because it seemd that they putting more filler stuff "celery" etc. in it and less pieces of lobster.  The Tomato Basil is still very good so that's my go to for soup, assuming we ever go back.
As for customer service?  Spotty at best.  Today the server behind the counter at the soup ask if I wanted any soup, I said yes, a small Tamato Basil.  I got up to the register (very crowded) and there was no soup?  The server of the soup had this blank stare on her face like "did you want soup"?  Then the cash registers were not working properly and we stood at the counter with our soup getting colder by the minute and 4 to 5 minutes later we finally got to sit and eat.  Only other comment (not a good one) is that the water out of one of the soft drink dispenser tasted very bad?  Not sure why but certainly something to be concerned about.  Well, that's it folks!  We live in Anthem and don't have a lot of great resturants in the ares so we are very sad that this place is seemingly going to hell in a hand basket!!

It's just too bad that a great track of two 18 hole championship courses can't Marshall their courses better.  We played yesterday and had to wait on every tee box.  For most of the round, we have 4 groups on every hole.  One approaching the green, one in the fairway and two waiting on the tee box.  I had to call the pro shop to ask them to come out and move people along.  Question is "WHY" should a customer have to call and ask for a Marshall?  Why aren't they pro-active in keeping the POP reasonable.  When the Marshall did come out he told us that their POP policy was 2 hours and 15 minutes a side.  Really???  Why not make it 5 hours a side so no one is ever responsible for slow play?  Too many sh*t head a mature golfers that think they are playing in a PGA tournament, lining up 4" putts, examining they from 4 sides before setting up to putt, standing in the rough of a par 5 fairway 300 plus yards from the green, waiting for the group to clear so they can hit their second shot (of 7).  Get over it people, there are others on the course, be considerate and play ready golf.  WeKoPa professional staff, get off the chair and get out on the course and make sure that everyone is enjoying their round, not just the butt heads that can't keep pace.  Nuff said!

We had dinner at this place when it opened. Absolutely fantastic. Service was great, food was killer. The friends I went to dinner with were new to Korean food, and the staff was very helpful in describing and suggesting dishes .The place is smaller, which I really dig. It's an intimate little setting with an open kitchen. The smells are amazing, it's a family atmosphere, and I left incredibly satisfied. Portions are large, and easily shared. Prices are good. For Asian in Pittsburgh- it's legit. Def a gem. Go early, it fills up quick.

This place is great. The food was very good and the service was excellent. I had sushi and my little one had the chicken satay off the kids' menu. The miso soup was good, too. They have a full Thai menu, and then a similar sushi menu to the Sushi 101's on Park Rd. and in Ballantyne. The decor is very nice, also. Go check it out.

I used to really like this store. They have neat little trinkets and just all kinds of fun items you won't find everywhere.  I go and browse fairly regularly and try to buy something every visit, because I like to support local businesses. However, after my last visit, I don't plan on going back. An employee there was so rude that I put back my items and left.  If you want to shop somewhere where the cashiers have that snobby, mean girl attitude, go here. If not, go elsewhere.

I'm not really sure what they're gong for here. When I have sold to them, I have brought in items that were brands like Calvin Klein, BCBG, Express, Limited, Gap, Forever 21, Old Navy, and bebe, but they just dig through the bag, pull out the clothes from Target, and purchase those. They reject the rest of them, claiming things like they "never heard of those brands" or "those are older people brands." The purchasers have always been very young ladies, probably still in their teens, but I'm still surprised they are unfamiliar with these brands. If they are specifically looking to buy and sell clothing for teens, it seems they should change their marketing to reflect this, because that is not the impression I get from their online presence and store name. My suggestion to shoppers would be to just head across the parking lot and buy your  clothes directly from Target, where you'll likely pay less for them new than they are charging for them used.

Overall, we had a positive experience.  Baja Soul has a rather unfortunate location. Although they are in Birkdale, they are tucked in the back as opposed to on the main drag, so you will likely only see the place if you are purposefully looking for it. Once we finally found it, we went in and stood at the front and looked around and saw just a few diners, but no staff.  After a minute or two, we were about to leave, when someone came and greeted us.  After that rough start, the service was friendly. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. I did not have any of the salsa, but it looked good. The mahi mahi fish tacos were very good, but be warned that they are spicy.  The Mexican Street Corn is awesome.  I did not care for the fried plantains, but they were prepared fine. I'd just never had plantains before and found that maybe they aren't my thing.  I'd say give this place a shot if you are a fan of trying different kinds of tacos. The prices are very reasonable, but I think they could get more business if they would advertise more and let people know, "Hey, we're back here."

I'm giving three stars because I love Chick-fil-A, in general, and until the last few months, this location has been perfectly fine. However, I haven't been going to this one lately because of how bad it was the last few times I went. I got chicken nuggets that tasted horrible. How can you ruin chicken nuggets? I got a salad that was significantly smaller than usual and contained wilted lettuce. I don't even think it was the same type of lettuce usually used in that salad. Worst of all, the service wasn't good in the drive-thru, and good service is usually a cornerstone of any Chick-fil-a. The last time I went through the drive-thru was on a weekend. It appeared that only teenagers were working and there were many of them. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but it took forever to get through the drive-thru. I've seen them get two long lines of cars through in no time, but not this time. While I was waiting in the line of cars, I suddenly heard yelling. Apparently two young employees were arguing by the open door between the ordering speaker and the window. I got to listen to that go unchecked for awhile in the slow moving line. When we finally got to the window, there were probably 10 teenagers standing around chatting about their love lives and various other things, but nobody was standing at the window to take my money or give me my order. There was one young lady who was trying to get everyone to work, but she was being ignored. Finally, the one person doing any work got our order together and took my money and gave me my food. After all that, they forgot my honey mustard sauce! My suggestion would be to have a responsible adult member of management work on the weekends, because the kiddos aren't managing themselves.

I haven't tried their pizza. I did try a stromboli and didn't care for it. However, their wings are fantastic! They're crispy with just the right amount of spice, or you can get them plain, if you prefer. We go here and order wings and salad for our meal. They're great and the staff is friendly.

The first cupcake I had here was the best cupcake I've ever had--a pumpkin cheesecake cupcake.  Unfortunately, they haven't had these again on any of my visits since and none of the other cupcakes I've tried have been as good, although most have been tasty.  The service is always okay--not rude but also not especially friendly.  I think if they would try to be a little more personable they could drum up more business, because they have a good product and good business idea.  I actually liked their old location better, but I can see why they moved, because the old one wasn't very visible.  I think more parents and little ones would come to the new location if they would make it easier to enter with a stroller.  Overall, they have a better space than their close competitor and a comparable product, but I think the reason their nearby competitor is always busier is because of the friendlier service.  Just Baked is definitely worth a try and I hope they stick around and keep coming up with great cupcakes.

I've been here a couple of times, but mostly forget it's there. I was reminded about the place by some reviews on here that had me wanting to try to they Chicago Dog, so I did. The remodeling looks nice, but I'm surprised they needed to expand their space, because I hardly ever see anyone in this restaurant. On this last visit, at lunchtime, I was the only customer there, but they kept me waiting for quite some time. When I finally got my Chicago Dog, I wasn't too impressed. The bun was very soft, which is a good thing, I suppose, but with all the liquidy toppings on top, the bun just got soggy and kind of dissolved underneath them. I probably won't bet getting that again, but having only tried a couple things on their menu, I may go again and try some more items.

I've been to this place three times. The first two times were for lunch. The food was mediocre, at best.  Their breakfast menu looked so good, though, that I decided to give it a try. Let's just say that this place really needs a management overhaul. The whole experience was shockingly bad. First, we were greeted by a young man who kept wondering off, coming back by, saying, "hold on," wondering off again, and then finally seating us in a restaurant that wasn't even particularly crowded. A little unusual, but no big deal so far. A waitress came in a reasonable amount of time and took our drink orders. My ice tea was horrid. It definitely did not taste freshly brewed and had an artificial lemon flavor to it. She took our orders, and brought the children's (burnt) food quickly. Then about 15 minutes later, came back and said they were out of what I had ordered. I found something else to order, and someone eventually brought it along with our other adult meal. Our food was cold when we got it, and of course the kids were done eating by then.  We then didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes, long after we had finished eating our cold food and were trying to entertain our children who were understandably getting restless at that point.  We were finally able to flag her down and get our bill. I never once saw any sign of management anywhere. I can't say that I would recommend the place, unless they get new management and some major staff training, which is a shame because it's a nice  looking place and has a potentially good menu.

I've given this place several chances, but they just aren't cutting it. I haven't had any problems with their other locations, but this one consistently has issues with service. I like their location and nice view of the boardwalk and lake, and their food is good, although for some reason not as good as the other Sushi 101 locations. The inside is nice, but could be cleaner. It looks like they never clean under the tables at the couches.  I also have noticed they don't have the greatest sanitation rating, which is a little frightening for a sushi restaurant.  The main problem, though, is the service. It's just always bad.  It doesn't matter if it's crowded, not crowded, lunch, dinner, weekend, weekday. I've tried all different times and it's just consistently bad--even when the owner is there. He seems to just wander around doing nothing and not noticing that people aren't being attended to by the servers.  Refills are hard to come by and the delivery of the food is strange.  After waiting for awhile, someone at the table may receive an entree when nobody else has even been served their soup or salad.  I want to like them, but they make it very hard.

This is the best place I've eaten in Las Vegas...the food is so tasty and fresh. The menu selection is so good -- everything looks amazing. I ended up with the poppyseed pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote. It was large enough for two meals and it was delicious. My friend got the vegan carrot-coconut pancakes so I got to try them too --- they were so fluffy and yummy too. I also ordered the green juice and it was so GOOD. I think the best I've had yet. The service was good. I wish there was a MTO's in Portland. My only regret is that I couldn't stay long enough in Vegas to try out the whole menu. If you are into fresh healthy and delicious and creative food, don't miss MTO.

Had to switch barbers because I moved and the place I used to go to didn't take appointments. Great old school barber shop that does the straight razor finish. You can make appointments online which is really convenient especially since I work a lot and don't have a lot of free time. Boris always cuts my hair and is great at what he does and also consistent. I never have to worry if it's going to be a good haircut and I'm kind of ocd about haircuts. I would definitely recommend this place.

I've been coming to George's for around 3 years since I live close by. However, I will never come back after the horrible customer service today. I ordered a gyro plate over the phone for take out. When I got there to pick up my food I looked and saw that it was a gyro. I asked to make it a plate and was told that I would be charged for a gyro platter in addition to the gyro I had in front of me because I said plate and not platter. I was told, "we don't have a gyro plate, we have a gyro platter." I've ordered dozens of times before and have never had a problem with the nit-picking of plate vs platter. They could have just thrown a scoop of rice in the box next to my gyro and charged me a dollar more and I would have been completely happy. Instead they chose to lose a customer of 3 years.

Stopped here for a snack while roaming the main drag in Vegas - candied bacon and cornbread app was delicious. The burnt ends and strawberry daiquiri....not so much. Burnt ends were not tender at all - ultimately inedible - and the daiquiri was out of one of those machines that are so popular on the strip, but it was so sweet and not enjoyable at all. Server was great, but likely will not return with all the other options!

REALLY good burgers and open late which is nice for late nights at the Aria! Like most places in the resort, it is pretty pricey and with multiple burger joints in the vicinity I will likely try another one next time. As well, seating is very limited so if you aren't lucky enough to get a seat at one of the five tables, you're eating your $30 burger and beer at a slot machine!

Stopped in to grab a snack and drink at the bar mid-day during our stay at the Aria - atmosphere is 5 stars for its trendy/modern style and super friendly bartender. Drinks were fine, but overpriced even for a Las Vegas strip resort ($15 draft beer) and the food just wasn't good. Had a few small plates, most notable the meatballs tasted odd...not recommended. All in all there are so many good little spots in Vegas....this one can be skipped!

All in all, very classy place in the heart of all that's good about Vegas! Rooms are clean, modern and hi-tech! The resort offers multiple restaurants so there is something for everybody, and most spots are open to at least midnight. You will indeed pay a premium for anything purchased at this resort, whether it is a bottle of water, a burger or a beer - not that this is anything different from the other higher end resorts on the strip. The staff is all EXTREMELY friendly and attentive, but I recommend if you are interested in gaming you head to one of the other close spots - maybe Monte Carlo?? Aria only offered continuous shuffle blackjack and 90% of the tables open on a Wednesday night were $100 per hand - okay if you are winning, but we had absolutely no luck at the Aria with gaming! In spite of this, I would totally stay here again! :-)

I have always gotten cheap haircuts (+/-$10), until my SO convinced me it really wasn't a good idea anymore and I should try something new. We found This place here on Yelp, and figured it was worth a shot. 

I felt comfortable as soon as I walked in. They don't take walk-ins but they had a spot open in a half hour, so they slotted me in, gave me a beer, and I sat on the patio while the time flew by. The stylist was super personal and professional and asked me enough questions to figure exactly what I wanted, and then totally delivered. Included in the experience and price and was a wash/rinse and a hand and shoulder massage which was unexpected but sorely needed. They even lined me up for another appointment in 5 weeks, which is turning out to be right on time. Total pros. 

I felt completely "taken care of" and would recommend 10/10. Completely worth the considerably low price in every way.

This was my fave mean in Montreal. They started with a mint lemonade and a platter of pita with 5 dips. Dips were a fried eggplant, garlic hummus, beets, cucumbers and onions and feta in oil and a shredded carrot and rasin coslaw. The lunch was a choice between 2 kabobs of varying types, a schnitzel sandwich and a few others for 13.50-14.50 including the dips and drinks. It was 2.50/person for more lemonade and the baclava was under 4.00 though they were out. The returant boasts all things are made from scratch in house down to the mayo. Everything was fresh and delish. The kabob choices fyi included chicken, a Persian beef, jerk chicken, fried feta, some sort of spicy sausage, falafel and more.

Wonderful service in both English and French and a very long list of options. Got a Californian inspired egg omelette with salsa, sour cream, sliced avacado, peppers and onions with a side of sliced and spiced potatoes and some fruit wedges. As a drink I got a banana chocolate expresso yogurt drink that woke me up good. All together about 21$ before tip.

So much fun to watch them make the noodles in the kitchen while you wait. I wish I'd known it was cash only before going though. Spring rolls were tasty and crispy and well worth the $2.50 and the pulled chicken dry noodle was absolutely amazing. Lots of people at the resturant did not delay service one bit.

Professional and friendly, perfectionist, clean and spacious, affordable, and most of all PAINLESS!  These are the first things that come to mind when I think about my experience with Josalyn.  It's been a over a month since getting my eyebrows corrected and a week since the touch up and I am very pleased with the results so far!  I'll be having my eyeliner done by Josalyn in a few weeks...hope it will be just as painless.

Big shock!! Went to this saloon after checking the reviews on yelp. I have med-length hair which i wanted to shorten/trim a bit, explained that to the so called ''barber'' (second one from the entrance), he made a face like he understood. Bottom line, i left with an inconsistent short cut hair that i cant even pull back!! No single question from the guy as to whether he was cutting too much or not and i kept quite, wanna see to what extent this recklessness could stretch, really disappointing and shame on someone whose my father's age to have such a weak performance coupled with ignorance!!! All cared for was chatting n laughing never stop with some non-customers sitting on the side.
Conclusion: this shop is busy collecting money only, afraid of using blades n scissors, obviously because of lack of skills, all cut are done solely by machine which is a scandal in the world of hair styling, good for zero degree hair cut by machine which you can do your self at home. There isn't a rating i can give lower than 1. 
p.s. This is the first time i review a service in my life.

I want this place to do well, I really do! Delicious food (my sandwich was incredible), great coffee, pleasant surroundings and sunny. Here's the thing: the vibe is a bit strange. The owner (?) treats the place like his living room, blasting pretty bad music and loudly singing along. I usually go to cafes to read, hang with friends and chill out, but the atmosphere was kind of aggressive with lots of dudes taking up a lot of space. Wasn't so comfortable. Still, I'll  give it another chance since the food/drinks were so good.

One of the most wonderful Thai massages I have received in Toronto. A beautiful space and my therapist was focused, attentive and very effective in relieving some back and neck pain I was having. A truly amazing experience.

My *only* complaint is that is seems strange to tip an RMT -- I consider this a medical service, and it makes the price prohibitive for some when you include tax and tip on top of the base price. Otherwise, highly recommended.

We used Bouncy Bouncy Inflatables for my son's 2nd birthday party and then again a couple weeks later for a neighborhood party.  Both times, the bounce houses were clean and in great condition.  
It was an easy, no hassle, and positive experience!! Would use them again in a heartbeat!

I can't believe I haven't been here before! What a cool place, as everyone else has said, you basically cross off what you don't like and they make everyone at the table a different meal for each course. It was an excellent meal, and everyone had a great time! I would probably give it a 5 star rating, but I really didn't like the kangaroo I had for my main course.  I've had other gamey meat like ostrich, bison, etc.. but it was never tough, this was really tough meat. Started with the Cucumber Mint Refresher which was excellent!

I can't believe anyone thinks this is the place for brunch! The food was ok, and the service was slow.  We arrived for Sunday Brunch booked on Open Table, and found out that booking brunch on Open Table actually gives you the "breakfast" buffet, which is really nothing special (the free hotel buffet at Hilton Garden Inn or Holiday Inn Express is just as good and fresh). You needed a steak knife to cut the over done sausages (Denny's has better pancakes and sausages at 1/8 the price). We got a great view with our table facing the door into the hotel, not the beautiful grounds (I guess they try and jam more tables in for the brunch). The breakfast buffet at the Westin Kierland is 100 times better than Rita's, with fresher food and a much better selection. The front staff was totally apathetic and showed very poor customer service training. They blamed me, not Open Table, for booking breakfast (even though I explained I clicked on the brunch category and link).

Checked out their website (www.slidinthru.com) for their location, and they were about a 5 minute drive from the strip so we headed to meet them.

The menu looked so great we ordered one of each!  They also made some custom, cheese & lettuce sliders for the kids. My favorites were the Kalbi Rib, Captain's Order, and the Barbie. But I do have to say the veg one was also a winner.   The buns were a perfect match, and they were grilled to perfection.   

This was the best (and by far the cheapest) meal we've had in Vegas (this certainly blew away the crappy lunch buffet we had on the strip). I've had sliders at many different restaurants around the country, and these were by far the best!

I've had both breakfast and lunch here (yes in the same day), both were amazing! Service was great, and fast (I went there on a Friday morning). For breakfast I had the mushroom & cheese stuffed omelet smothered with a sherry cream sauce, served with olive bread. VERY rich, but delicious.   They always give me a cup of coffee to go, love their attention to detail. For lunch I had the Arrogant Bastard Burger (local organic beef from the Stockyards), very tasty & huge.  They have free wi-fi and covered parking next door in the parkade.

Had a dinner party here in one of their private dining rooms.  The food, drinks, and service were all outstanding.   Started with the calamari, Antipasto (w/cured meats, artisan cheese, marinated olives, Marcona almonds, quince paste and flat bread), Crispy Calamari with aioli and 
Lamb Merguez Sausage; followed by the Caprese; mozzarella, tomato and basil; and for the main course I had the Flat Iron steak, fingerling potatoes, shishito peppers, piperade sauce (cooked perfectly).  I finished off my meal with the Julia Baker Chocolate Mousse Cake.  I have to say everything was 5 star: food was fabulous, service was excellent, I'll  certainly be back again!

The burgers seem smaller than I remember, and the prices are NYC prices ($18 for a burger, fries and tiny custard). As others have said, the place is way over priced. Food took way too long for the 2 people in line before me. I did like the burger, and I liked not waiting in line for an hour like you need to do in NYC, but still not doing it for me.

One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. Arrived for a late Thursday morning breakfast (11am) and only had to wait 5-10 minutes. Server was friendly and I had the chorizo scramble special. It was great! Very tasty and flavorful. I am one of the pickiest breakfast eaters (i.e. I don't really consider US Egg & Denny's breakfast places). I expect my eggs and all the ingredients to be fresh, and that was certainly the case at Matt's!! This is one of my two favorite breakfast places in the valley (for different reasons, I consider Matt's and the Orange Table to be complimentary).

Had the Salmon & Tuna sushi and is was amazing. Some of the best sushi I've had in the Valley.   The sushi was generous, and very fresh (can't really ask for much more at a sushi place).  The also seem to have an assortment of rolls that are on special from Sunday-Thursday night, but the sushi was so filling, I couldn't eat any more.  The place was very busy, and the staff was very attentive.

Arrived around 5pm one Wednesday evening. The place is not in a nice area of Phoenix, and it looked deserted, and I was going to leave, when I saw a Mercedes and Lexus pull up.  So I thought I'd give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Lo's for $11 (2 waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *'s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasn't real maple syrup (I'd imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasn't very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side.

The place is a hole in the wall right behind the PHX car rental center. Arrived at dinner time, and had the best Mexican food! I had the #5 Machaca Plate w/rice, beans, & one of their homemade tortilla's burrito style. It was just amazing, and so cheap ($5.65). The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used, and looks very dirty, I did find it a bit sticky. Maybe this is a better place for pickup.  If you want a clean restaurant, their North restaurant on Cactus Road restaurant is much cleaner.

If I could do a 3.5 star review, I would, it's more than "a-ok" but I wouldn't say "yah I'm a fan." I think the place was only opened a few days, I would also rate it higher if they had it staffed properly. Arrived at lunch, and the staff is in "training" mode so it took forever for them to take the two orders ahead of me, and the line behind grew very quickly.  If the service was quick, then I would certainly rate it a four.  Had the "Bueno Burger" with jack cheese.  I think this is something else I don't like about the place, you need to add .75 for cheese. I'd prefer if they included cheese with each type of burger. The burger was certainly good, not sure if its as good as Smash Burger, but certainly in the same league (not a comparison to Delux).  Burger was tasty, would certainly go back if I was in the neighbourhood and felt like a burger.

Been to the one on South Beach, and the burgers and fries are just as good here!  My only complaint is I asked for ketchup, and they absolutely drenched the burger! (eeew).  After scraping off a 1/4c of ketchup the burger was fantastic, much, much better than In and Out Burger.  I did remember to order the regular fries (which is enough for a family with small children).   The fries here are the BEST!  Nice to see an alternative to In and Out Burger.  I think the burger and fries at Five Guys Rock!

Just had an early dinner with the kids tonight (kids eat free from 3-6pm btw).  I had the prime rib and my wife had the fish special, kids had the mac and cheese. All were great meals. The reason to go here is to sit on the patio, it's fantastic!  Not impressed that at 5:30pm I had to valet, when I'm with the family, I'd just rather park and walk (needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways!).  This place is not cheap, and with $18 glasses of wine, there is no happy hour at the restaurant!

First time to this restaurant.  I think the "steak house" thing was over done, but I'm happy I went here.   I actually split the 8oz petite filet (mignon), it was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The sides come family style, and we shared the sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and spinach, all were very good (and I'm sure loaded with butter!).   Great place, be prepared to valet.

I did catch an episode of Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives and since they did get Matt's Big Breakfast right, I was hoping for the same for this place. I have to say the Bombero burrito rocked! It was so tasteful with the right amount of heat (certainly not 5 alarm, but nice), and other Mexican spices. The kids had two $1.15 taco's each which was the right amount for them (if you're an adult, I would probably get 4). The place is tiny, not the best setup, but the line moved fairly quickly.  I'll certainly be back, it ranks up there with Carolina's as one of my ATF for Mexican in the valley.

I eat here a regularly, but realized I've never given them a review! The menu is simple, and if you want a "fast food" burger this is the only place to go.  I typically order the double-double w/o the (thousand islands sauce) and onion (this saves not only by breathe, but about 200 calories), and have them add ketchup and mustard. I do have to say the fries are just ok (5 Guys' are much better, but then they are 1400 calories for the large, so I'll eat these ones and be happy my waist is not expanding).  Always lined up during the busy hours, but the line does move fairly quickly.  Just a great burger!

Been here many times for breakfast, the place is a zoo, but it is sort of a controlled chaos, but tonight it was just a write off. I don't know if they were short staffed, but a quick coffee, turned into 20 minutes, then we were told to go stand in line again (10 deep) at 7pm?!?  Extremely slow service, so if you want a quick coffee in the evening go somewhere else, but they seem to have morning coffee figured out!  Of course the parking is the usual :(

Stopped by for quick dinner at the bar (burger arrived within 10-15 minutes which was great). I wanted to change up the cheese with Manchego instead of American, so I chose the Zinburger with Manchego Cheese & Zinfandel Braised Onions (w/light mayo).  Overall a great burger, I just thought the onions overpowered the cheese. Great staff, very friendly,  and I will certainly come back and try out the Samburger (which I was told is one of the more popular burgers).

I've never been here before, so I thought I'd check it out. My usual breakfast places are Matts Big Breakfast, La Grande Orange, and Orange Table which I think are all outstanding.  Had to wait a bit for the coffee pot to arrive, which was surprising since it wasn't that busy.  Coffee was terrible, typical truck stop stuff. Had the special, San Antonio Skillet (potatoes, red bell peppers, green chilies, diced chicken, jack, eggs, sour cream & cilantro. The chicken was tough and chewy, must have been left overs from yesterday.  Food took a long time to arrive, and was not hot. Service was so-so (waitress certainly wasn't enthusiastic), This place is akin to a typical tasteless truck stop breakfast joint, If you want great service, tasty, fresh food go Matt's, La Grande Orange, and Orange Table. This place is around the corner from where I live so it's very convenient, and I'll probably be back to check out one of their Benedict's since many reviewers said they were great.

This was a very good burger. I ordered the 1/3lb Arizona special with a fried egg. They cook their Angus beef burger at a high heat with a crispy finish, and it tasted great!  Also ordered a side of their herb yam fries which were very good.  They also have Tazo iced tea, which was a nice touch. This location is a bit of a pain, since there is no free parking (it is in a parkade, so you can get some shade by parking in there). The burgers are $5.99 with an extra $1.99 for fries or yam fries.

I've been working out at Pure Barre Glendale for about 2 years now and it's hands down the healthiest addiction a girl can have (I've never been this toned and strong!!!) From the first class to over 500 classes it NEVER gets easy, you only get stronger and discover new ways to challenge yourself. Pure Barre targets your full body, all the areas that every girl wants to tone up. It's an hour spent working hard to amazing music with WONDERFUL teachers who motivate and inspire you to push yourself past your comfort zone. A nice bonus, ALL the clients that attend the classes are the nicest people which makes for a place you always look forward to coming back to. It's a great workout for anyone. Any age, fitness level, someone who has a lot of dance experience or absolutely none. I highly recommend Pure Barre to anyone looking for a way to tone your body, build strength, all while making lifetime friends. 

Tip: Commit to at least a month at Pure Barre (try 4 classes a week) because it just gets better and better the more you learn the technique :)

Not impressed.  I had heard so many good things about this spot, so when an aquantience was having a "thing" there I took time and money out of my personal accounts to join the party. What a waist. I was very disappointed. The dinning room had way to dark "mood" lighting (we could barely read the menu and everyone knows dimness vails flaws), the waitress was annoyed, snarky, the crab cakes were super fishy. I had to spit them out in the bathroom to avoid food poisoning. The mashed potatoes served with the over priced surf & turf had to be instant! Although I can't be positive about the mashed potatoes, the texture and flavor definitely tasted like it. There is no outdoor smoking area, you can't take your drinks outside (laws and all). The dinning area was claustrophobic and they wouldn't split the check (understandable, but still annoying). Overall, not the best experience. My suggestion, if you're someone who prefers quality over quantity (cheap happy hour), this is not the spot for you. Save your money. Go somewhere with more integrity. Somewhere that doesn't insult the intelligence of its patrons. Really? Instant mashed potatoes with surf & turf. Tacky.

I was on a girls' weekend trip to Montreal and we had one vegetarian and one vegan with our group. We were just wandering on our way to the train station and came across it. Even if you aren't a vegetarian or vegan, it's still delicious. They have soups and a salad bar, so it's perfect for a light lunch. I had a tomato soup and salad and it was delicious. They also had cooked food- like vegetarian shepherd's pie, spaghetti squash pasta, roasted veggies, along with desserts, juices and coffees. The setting was lovely, the staff were nice and it was very clean. There were also big windows, so it would probably be perfect for a sunny mid-day coffee and snack or slow, light lunch.

We had a solid experience here- the food was a great price, the atmosphere is great, loved the decor & I'm a fan of a simple menu. Our waitress was nice & informative but unfortunately the fact that no one at our table could enjoy their meal because of the spice level was a little bit of a damper. We all like spicy food and ordered 1's & 2's on a scale of 5 but our food was literally covered in red-pepper flakes :(  Again, I'm no wimp to spice- I'm the girl who is usually dumping tabasco on my food but this was a whole other story. 

We will give it another shot because it really is a neat little spot and what we could taste of the food was definitely solid.

A good mixed crowd age wise which is nice- mostly people who like good food and want a nice dinner out- not too fancy but nice enough. 

The free bean dip/bread is a nice unique offering. The garden side salad was yummy and different than what you'd typically get. The quinoa puff appetizer was good but nothing compared to the ginormous pork chop on top of goat cheese chive whipped potatoes I got- deliciously prepared. My hubby got the crab cakes and risotto which was equally as amazing. 

We really were impressed with this place- I think it is totally flying under the radar for how solid it is. We will definitely be back but hope the menu changes up every once in awhile as there aren't a whole lot of options. 

My one suggestion- educate your servers about gluten allergies- it's a pretty common question, especially in fine dinging and my server had absolutely no idea what gluten even was.

I really wanted to like this place- the decor was great and the menu had some nice diversity but there were just some things that I think should have been done a lot better- especially for the price & hype that surrounds UP. For example: 

- The salumi & chese plate was blah blah blah. The 2 different cheeses literally tasted like...well, nothing. It's not that hard to find a good cheese in Pittsburgh- just go down to Penn Mac and get something to make it worth the $.

- My scallops were tasty but cold. My husband and I were there for an early dinner and were one of the only people in the restaurant so I don't understand why it was so hard to make sure our food was hot. 

- Finally, I understand toddlers are hard to control but when you have parents that are literally encouraging their child to crawl around on the floor like a gorilla (their words, not mine) and screaming/playing right next to people who are out for a nice dinner and paying a nice price, I would appreciate someone asking the parents to at least not encourage their child to treat the restaurant as their playground. 

We've only been there once but unfortunately I think the hype that surrounds up be just that...hype.

My husband and I decided to try Cibo as it was part of a "discount card" fundraiser we had signed up for & when I looked at their website/menu online, they identified themselves as "gluten free friendly" and more than happy to accommodate any allergy/dietary needs and as a GF girl, anytime an Italian place says they have GF pasta, I'm pretty happy! We dined on a Saturday evening, with reservations. 

I usually try and keep it pretty positive when it comes to reviewing restaurants but our experience was the complete opposite of positive and I hope some changes can be made their in the future because their food had some great elements & their owner was nice but other than that....ugh. 

When I mentioned that I am GF and asked if I could get the Chicken Parm but without breadcrumbs (which I would normally not even think to ask for but since they had identified themselves as being willing to accomodate allergies I went ahead and asked), I was told the chef "is busy and wouldn't want to do that but that he could just put some grilled chicken on top of the pasta but she didn't want to ask him to make it "parmesan" style, even though I'm pretty sure that would just consist of putting some sauce and cheese on top. I can understand when things are busy it is hard to accomodate special requests (even simple ones like mine) but as a customer (who is paying $20 + for dinner), I don't think I should have to worry about if my order will stress the chef out. Either don't claim to be GF friendly or get some more kitchen help? In the end, I ended up paying a pretty high price for noodles, marinara sauce & grilled chicken :( 

Our waitress only smiled when she was dropping off the check & we only smiled when we could finally leave.

My husband and I have been wanting to try this place out as we don't eat gluten or dairy and they offer gf pizza & vegan cheese, which we are thrilled about! We ordered a pizza and wings and I will say that we both agreed they tasted great- no complaints there. However, there were 2 big issues we had with our experience: 1) They only offer 1 size of gf pizza; for an average pizza place this might be understandable but when at least 1/2 of your advertising efforts are put toward claiming to be "allergen friendly pizza place"- it should be expected that you offer more than one size pizza as my husband and I splitting 4 slices was pretty disappointing...so why didn't we order a 2nd pizza? Well, that leads me to the 2nd issue- the price...$24 for a small pizza (4 small slices) and 6 wings is MUCH MORE than a little on the pricey side. Again, while the food was good, with all the GF options coming available now, we will spend less $ getting more pizza elsewhere. 

Please lower your prices & offer more than on sized pizza Mandy's because we'd really like to come back!

Honestly, this has got to be one of the BEST things offered in Pittsburgh! My hubby and I have been wanting to try zip lining so when we heard about Go Ape and that it was a little more than just zip lines, we were excited...and nervous! Needless to say, it was a blast! Everything is well organized and they give you instructions that make you feel comfortable but not micro-managed. 

It was the perfect length of time (about 2.5-3hrs) and had a variety of of activities that kept things interesting & fun. We seriously cannot wait to bring some of our friends here as it would be a great activity to do with a small group! 

My only word of caution is that I would say if you aren't in good physical shape this could be challenging as pulling yourself up a rope ladder isn't as easy as it might seem but by no means do you have to be in peak physical condition to enjoy this. Such a great time!

I. love. Eden. 

Why? 

- Great service; they are always knowledgeable and don't look at you like you have 3 heads when you ask them about their ingredients or mention your food allergy. 

- It's small, intimate, clean & simple. 

- The food is DELICIOUS. Even my husband who is the farthest thing from GF or vegan absolutely loved everything we ordered from the raw menu. In my opinion, their chef is one of the most skilled I've ever encountered because they are making delicious dishes that you don't at all feel like you're missing out on stuff from (as you sometimes do with GF/vegan dishes). 

- Everything is fairly priced for what you are getting. 

- Their raw desserts are AMAZING and have no added sugar! 

I love love love Eden- I only wish they had more hours & more locations :)

- The sushi was incredibly fresh & top notch as agreed upon by everyone in our party- the best sushi we've ever had. 
- The atmosphere/decor leaves a lot to be desired- with how good the food is (& what their prices are), they could try a little harder (and put some cushions down on their hard benches- our tushes were not happy at the end of our meal!)
- We could tell our server was new & everyone has to learn so we gladly cut him some slack on not quite knowing what everything on the menu was.
- Our biggest qualm was that it took FOREVER for our food to come out and it was a Thursday early evening with not that many people in the restaurant so that was a little strange. 

Overall, a good place to go if you want really good sushi but I think there's still lot of room for improvement as an establishment as a whole.

First, I'll say this place does have a few good points:
- Aesthetically it's beautiful- very posh, well decorated and a pretty relaxing atmosphere. 
- It was easy to locate and had plenty of parking. 
- It was easy to schedule and the staff were all friendly enough. 

However, the thing that brought me to write this review is the quality of the massage I received. While the therapist I saw today was super nice, I honestly feel like I just got oiled rubbed on my skin for an hour. While I can only hope that if I had requested a Deep Tissue massage over the Swedish that it would have been more worth it, honestly- the pressure was non-existent. 

What was even more upsetting to me was that the whole reason I went in for a massage was because I was having some neck issues and made sure to make it known to the therapist before the session began that was what I wanted to focus on...and she basically just did a typical body massage. I've had many massages and that's what she did- no focus on the area /reason I went in there in the first place. And the fact that I paid $70 (not including tip) for this makes me uber regrettful. Sure, I could've complained and tried to direct her movement and pressure but you don't pay that much money to go in there and do that. 

I feel like this place has a lot going for it but I think it would be greatly beneficial for the therapists to do more of a "consultation" with the client to see what it is they want exactly and then make sure they stick to that.

I made reservations for a larger party in this small-ish restaurant for my hubby's bday; I will be honest I was a little nervous given some of the negative reviews I had read that called this place uber hipster and snobby but let me tell you, I was no disappointed with our visit! 

Why Cure is hands down one of my new favorite restaurants: 
- The atmosphere is great- super rustic, unique, woodsy, creative- they have put intention into every detail and it shows. 
- The salumi plate was SO good; however, while they did great at explaining what each thing was there were so many options that our party didn't know what we were eating at any given time; maybe put little flags in each choice so people can know what they are eating...? 
- The food was DELICIOUS; in our big party we pretty much tried everything on the menu and everyone was blown away. 
- They were great about plating/serving our cupcakes; I was a little put off that they told us (multiple times) that they were going to charge $2 per person to serve the cupcakes, which I find to be a little ridiculous when you're already bringing in a party of 7 with $30 entrees each, but in the end they didn't end up charging us for it. 
- The service was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. 

Needless to say, Cure is doing a great job and they provided for a wonderful birthday experience- I can't wait to go back again.

I love this place- it's everything I want in a spa. It's beautiful, calming, clean and modern without making me feel like I'm in a Buddhist temple. The therapists are always great and professional and the prices are average. My only complaint is that my last therapist talked to me the entire time and I would have preferred to just veg out but other than that, I have nothing but love for this place!

What a hidden GEM! 

Why this is one of my new favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh: 
- It doesn't take itself too seriously but you still feel like you're getting a good quality experience and even more important, quality food. 
- Speaking of, the food....YUM. This menu is wonderful, a WIDE variety of things, many I have never seen in Pittsburgh before. We ordered some of every type of meat (the chorizo was our fav!), some wings, guac (delish!) and the plantains for dessert.
- The waitress was great- I think it would be helpful for them to have more than 1 server for the entire restaurant because the poor girl did look a bit frantic at some points but she handled it well for being the only server there. 
- The cost is super reasonable and allows you to try multiple things on their menu which is great, because believe me, you'll want to. 

Can't wait to go back!

I am fairly new to Yelp, and the restaurant reviews, and it is more than a bit confusing.
When I looked at reviews for this restaurant, I was thinking that perhaps we should not go - there were so many negative comments about the, staff and/or the food.  But we went anyway.
And, I've got to tell you that the entire evening was terrific!  We chose the full 6 course dinner with wine paring.  Not only was the food fantastic, but the staff could not have been more professional, caring, and just plain terrific.  
There were 8 of us for dinner, yet the kitchen turned out the food on a perfectly timed basis, and was overall an awesome evening.
In the future, if I use Yelp, I will only read the positive comments, those with negative comments are probably just not too happy generally......

Family decided to try more new restaurants for 2014 and Bindia was a great find. Wife and I enjoyed the heat and flavours of the butter chicken and vindaloo. My 7 year old enjoyed the tandoori, mango lassi and khulfi. Highly recommend for dinner. Went back later for lunch and had the lamb wrap - awesome. Can't wait for summer and the windows to open for the atmosphere from the Market.

Food is good and they have a great beer selection. Every waiter/waitress is in skinny jeans and a vintage T-shirt showcasing how original they are. If you can get past that and the below average service it is a good place to get a bite and a pint. Also the seating inside is mostly wicked uncomfortable so have an extra pint.

Small but nice place in the center of Coronado. There were four of us and two of us had the daily special. The food was cooked well,However it wasn't impressive at all. We paid over $70 and my son only had a juice and a muffin. I was expecting more than mediocre food for the price. On the upside the muffin was good as was the service.

The restaurant has a nice vibe with a lovely outside area. The service  was attentive even though at lunch they were very busy. The specials are well priced however the food was sub par. I ordered the street tacos and the chicken tinga for starters isn't chicken tinga even for a Scottsdale version. Also the chicken was so dry it was inedible...even the tortillas were over cooked.

We had Design Tree Maintenance do quite a bit of work for us last year. The bill was over $1000. When I arrived home most of the work had been done. The crew was arrogant and surly. They got in their truck to leave when I noticed they had  left a mess in the front and back yards; I asked them to clean it up and they acted like I was asking for something ridiculous.  Last week, and against our better judgement we called for an estimate to prune our 4 citrus trees. An arborist gave us a quote to have them pruned. The office called and confirmed the appointment. We came home from work and the trees weren't for trimmed. The next day I left a message at both the office and with the arborist. The arborist called back to say the trimming guys came out but said it was too much work for the amount quoted. He said he'd be have to come back and look at the trees again. So in short, they don't honor their estimates this place is the worst.

Never again. SK was referred to me from my insurance company. That in itself should have been a warning flag. If SK is funneled lots of business without having to do anything to earn it, they have no incentive  to do a good job. They have a problem in their painting department and quality control. They were nice enough, didn't give me a hard time, but it was a waste of my time to drive over there only to find a big list of repairs that were not done or done very badly. There are plenty of body shops to choose from, not going back there.

The wait was ridiculous even though 90% of the tables were open. Tacos are tiny and $3.50 each. You have to ask for chips and salsa, they don't automatically bring it or ask if you would like it. The food is very good but I've never left a Mexican restaurant hungry, first time for everything. I've been to Barrio Not a good value for the money. Joyride, which is right down the street knocks Barrio out of the water with regards to price and a friendly, welcoming vibe.

The Gull and Firkin is very hit or miss. It's a okay place to grab a drink and their fish and chips is pretty decent but the service and some of the other things off the menu is a gamble. I've given it a try several times and there have been times when everything has been good and times when everything has been bad. So unfortunately on my last experience is what will be cited most. We ended up with 3 different waitresses taking orders from us (weird) and NEVER  order the crunchy chicken sandwich. The first one came our and I took a bite which was just bread I then opened it up to find that I had scared the chicken into the furthest corner of the bun. It was literally the size of 2 quarters and that's generous. The good news was they apologized and had another one ordered right away. The fries were good though.

Came with a few friends who were craving butter chicken so thought of this place. We all ordered the butter chicken roti and we were all definitely satisfied. The place is a little run down but the food was excellent. Large portions, tasty food the only complaint was the long wait. We must have just ordered right after a massive take out order as we waited approx 30 mins while people kept coming and going after us with their orders in hand. Other than that no complaints!

After going to several physio clinics over the years with no success i finally found a home. I have bad knees and shoulders and according to the staff I shouldn't be able to walk upright lol. But with sessions from the staff I've already gotten back into all the sports I was used to playing before life took its toll on me. Paul (owner and therapist) is a truly caring individual and does his best to accommodate your schedule. The RMT's are also magnificent and I definitely recommend throwing in a massage session as well.

I'm very picky when it comes to mexican food and Caldero is Tops!  The portions are more than what you would expect and are beautifully presented.  My partner and I especially love the happy hour specials, the barbacoa street tacos are to die for.  

If you love true authentic mexican food at a great price you must visit Caldero - you will NOT be disapointed.

I came here once and will never come back. 

The food was not just terrible, it made me sick. I ordered the oven baked antojitos, and all I could taste was cheap, squishy cheese. I spent the next morning throwing up because of the two antojitos I did eat. 

We also ordered the spinich dip, which was okay, but the waitress mixed up our order and gave us cheesy bread first. She wouldn't admit her mistake and made it out to be our fault. Overall the service was cold and unfriendly. 

Food was terrible, service was terrible. Not much else to say.

I was looking for a Steakhouse for my bachelor party last weekend. We had a group of ten who were all on mixed budgets but I still wanted a good steak. With a group of ten guys in their mid twenties I wanted a restaurant that was more trendy and less romantic. This worked out nicely with it's ambient lighting, good music and easy going staff. 

I'm surprised of the complaints about service. We received excellent service especially considering we had a few guys who had been drinking since noon and were not the easiest to deal with. They were friendly and we received prompt service.

The food was great. The only thing to beware of is that they cook their steaks a little more on the well done side. So since I wanted a medium-rare, I ordered rare and it came out perfect for my taste. A couple guys ordered the sea bass and were very impressed. Only the two who ordered chicken were less than impressed, but who orders chicken at a steakhouse anyways. 

Make sure you get the 2 for 1 drink coupons from the girls handing them out in the casino. They were more than willing to take the coupons for our large group which knocked 100 dollars off of our total. Well worth it.

I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. Or bitter, in this case.

Kinh Do, if you wanted people to leave in disgust, having a restaurant full of roaches and rodents would be a quicker alternative than having the sorry excuse of a wait staff you have. Your cashier, a stiff and bored looking high school student, wanders aimlessly through the mass of waiting customers, while the managers find it amusing to tell people that tables are "not available"..and they sure aren't, not with the piles of food scraps and dirty dishes that are begging to be swept away. 

Fast-forward 45 min, and we're finally seated. Fast-forward 30 more minutes, and we're finally given some water in this dry Nevada heat. Oh, did I forget to mention that we grabbed our own napkins and menus after asking half a million times? Yuppers. Another 30 min of twiddling our thumbs and our orders arrive, and surprise surprise! Y'all guessed it. The order comes out wrong. 

I'm usually not one to be sarcastic, but at that moment, it was looking to be prettttty darn funny. And not like ha-ha funny, but I'm-about-to-give-you-a-penny-tip kinda funny.

The search for the best burger - 2011 Review #2.
A lot of fanfare goes with this joint. Mostly from the US. I got the banquet burger. One patty with bacon. It was thin and overdone. The buns are toasted. YEAH. The Cajun fries are horrible and the regular fries are ok. Will somebody please educate burger joints on double frying. The only consolation is free refills, unless you order take out. I won't be going back. Look for review #3. Still searching.

Lunchtime 12:00 - appetizer (Charcuterie Board) showed up 40 minutes later and it was only a cold platter. I realize lunch time can be busy, but you are running a restaurant, deal with it. Not impressed. Table side service and the staff are great, the kitchen is the issue here. 
Entre - Seared Scallops and Spicy Merquez Sausage. More like braised scallops, there was zero caramelizing on them and they were buried underneath, instead of showcasing them. The sausage is quite spicy and dominates the dish. Pasta undercooked. Come on now. This price level on an entre and the pasta is under cooked. I am glad this was an invite, because I won't eat here on my own nickel.

First time there for the XC loop. Well worth the visit. 1.5 hours later my winter legs are toast. Great way to stay in shape during the off season. Sunday was super busy. There must have been 100 people riding in various areas. Love this place.

Two glasses of Malbec and a plate of lobster fritters, to get things started. Wow. Finally, great food. Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Great taste and texture. These could become my new food group.

Entrees. For me fish tacos (fried) with house side; for her Combine meatloaf with garlic mash and slaw. Three choices of hot sauce at the ready. I am impressed with this place. Very impressed. My mustard vinagrette was perfect and everything was fresh. Great balance of flavour in the tacos and did I say fresh; as in homemade tortillas fresh. My significant other could not finish her meal, so I rose to the occasion. Amazing meatloaf. If you have never experimented with blending ground meat, you need to try this. Now. Meatloaf, burgers....etc. It adds another level of flavour to the plate and helps maintain moisture. The wrapping of double smoked bacon, just melts in your mouth. 

In a world of poor mega portion platings, (1 kebab and 4 cups of rice) this was spot on and is just what this area needs. Close to transit and great food. It would have been a 5 star if it wasn't for the inquisitive wasp and the noise. We were only 1 of three seatings in the place at the tme and it was LOUD. Some may like that kind of environment, not me.

Grab some friends, go here. Everybody order something different and sample. The service is top notch and very friendly. It doesn't get much better than this. Enjoy.

4 stars, because I have only been here once. Consistency is key. The quality here is top notch. $7 for a quality product is not over the top. Really good food has a cerebral quality to it for me. The flakiness of the pastry, the butter, the savoury flavours and texture. Stop staring out the window during lunch and truly feel the flavours you are experiencing. If you want more food, then but another pie. If you are complaining about the prices, then go spend $13 at a mega fast food joint where the packaging has more nutrition and flavour then the food.

Release the neanderthal in you. I ordered the Wild Boar and rings. Both a bit overdone (cooking game meat is tricky), but very satisfying. If you have a penchant for game meat and fresh ingredients, you can't go wrong. My colleague had the regular burger and fries and he loved it. We both complimented our indulgence with the Mill house Organic on tap. Good times were had by both and short nap afterwards would have been nice. Wait staff were prompt and pleasant. I'll be going back for the 8oz Bison burger next.

Outstanding!! Winterlicious menu.
Appetizer: Fried Calamari 
Entree: Chicken Marsala w fingerling potatoe and veg.
Desert: Chocolate Mousse
Wine: Malbec

This outing was a welcome surprise and our best Winterlicious experience. We were thrilled they had Malbec on the list.

More than enough Calamari for one, could even be shared.

The chicken was fantastic. It was butterflied, but seemed like two breasts. Juicy and very tender. Veg included peppers, green beans, zucchini and turnip. They use seasonal items when available. Everything was cooked perfectly. Nice and tender with just the right amount of crunch on the veg. I can be a fairly big eater, but I was getting full.

Desert was spot on. I wanted to hoover it up but held back. Not too sweet, light and airy.

This eatery is a gem on the Danforth. We will be back.

Went there to have some links removed from my watch and buy some earrings. (for me). Nancy was super helpful. I left the watch, went back 20 minutes later. Watch was till too big and they worked on it while I was there, other customers were coming and going while I was there and all the staff were very attentive. This is a great little spot in the core for jewellery repair, without the high cost of a more upscale storefront like Birks.

Eating in. Bring a parka. No seriously. This place is freezing. The food mediocre. The service, not so good. Coffee was not even made when we arrived at 6:15 PM. Salt, pepper, sauce.....etc are available at the courtesy area. Are you kidding me. It should be on the tables. They apologized for the service, because it 'got kind of busy'. What!!! Welcome to the restaurant business, you WANT to be busy. Two couples left while we were waiting and they were ordering take out. If there is a way to order ahead of time and pick it up, do that. I sincerely hope the other locations are managed better. My last time visiting this location.

This is review #1 in my Summer of 2011 Search for the Best Burger. It's Saturday and at 12:01 PM, we are already lined up at the Priest. It's cozy, nuff said. The smell is great, just enough to start the salivation process. The fresh meat is nicely formed into balls up, as each serving awaits it's transformation. I chat with some other patrons, it must be my good looks, because others are asking me what this is and what that is. I reply quickly, I am a Burger Priest virgin. I order a double-double for my significant other and 'The Priest" for myself. Somehow this seems wrong, given my strict catholic upbringing and years as an alter boy. Then my world is shattered. The mushroom fryer is broken. OH THE HUMANITY. So I opt for the double-double and an order of fries. I go for tomatoe, onion and mayo. Let the burger sing it's own song people. It's juicy, the meat flavour is there. Nice crisp on the patty and a minimal bun. It's good, but where are the angels, the path to the white light? Still waiting. Could you and I make these burgers at home? Of course. Is this the holy trinity of meat, bun and add ons, as others have stated? Not in my opnion, or at least not yet. Are they good, absolutely. Eating out is not just about convenience, we are after all, social creatures. It's partially the experience and the thought that an individual at the stove will take our taste buds and our spirit to another level. I will be back at "The Priest" someday and am looking forward to giving them 5 stars. God willing. Namaste.

Lunch time with a friend on Saturday. Brisket on a bun was greasy. Friends smoked turkey was dry as a bone and stringy. The service was godd, hence the 2 stars. IMO the menu is too large. If you want to serve great deli, focus on that. I won't be back. It might appeal to 95% of the people. The rest of us are not picky or perfectionists, we have a standards when it comes to dining out. If you are going to run a food establishment, show us your passion.

Take out order. Batter soggy when it got home. Never pack two orders of fish in the same box. Counter person couldn't tell me the difference between halibut and haddock. You are running a restaurant. It is your job to know all about it and the food you serve. "Halibut is a big fish", yeah that helps :( Fish over cooked. Fries nothing to write home about it. Sorry, but I don't see the attraction here. I'll go back to Duckworth's in a heart beat for their Sole, but I will try British F&C first.

What's a sultan burger ? I quote " The Sultan burger consists of the 8oz burger, plus tandoori chicken samosas, butter chicken vegetables, provolone cheese and a lime pickle and jalapeno relish." Now I know what you're thinking, way too much going on there. Not so. The patty is perfectly cooked, juicy, full of flavour. The samosa has great crunch and there is just the right amount of spice. On paper it doesn't work, in your mouth it works wonderfully. The catch; these specialty burgers change on a weekly basis. The quantity of the food is substantial. Go here hungry, but go here. I will be a return customer with my eye on the Mac and Cheese and Veal meatloaf.

I used to come here quite a bit but it's been a while and I have to say it will be a while if ever that I come back. 

We orders the fajitas for two. At least half of it was onions. There was definitely not enough meat for two people for the $26. 

We also ordered the pitcher of margaritas. And it basically tasted like sweet and sour mix on ice. There was little to no tequila. 

The service was not great either.

I was driving through on a long trip to California and had some handling problems. They replaced the rear shocks but that was not the problem. When I got to LA, still with the same problem, I went to another place and they replaced the front struts: no more problem. When I called AAA, the guy told me they would make things right, but never heard back from him or his boss after 2-3 calls and a letter by mail.

Order a 6 inch pizza; after seeing customers who came in after me. Leave out with their order; ask cashier what happen to me order. The responds, " I don't know."  Oh, your pizza was dropped.  Ok, when were they going to tell me????  WOW!!!!  Then you think they would have made my pizza first, right???  NO!!! WOOW.......and still was not making my order.  Well, I sat down thinking they would make make my order.  After another person left out; I just ask for my money back.  When trying to get the money back; the person who was taking the pizza out of the oven....................did not have a clue what was going on with the order!!!! Guess what....still have not make my pizza!!!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!     That was a big fail with your staff on customer service; may be if the pizza maker was not joking around and laughing he would not have dropped the pizza.

Das Primanti Bros. ist u.a. für seine Pitts-Burger bekannt. Es begann als Trucker-Kneipe in den 30ern und hat sich mittlerweile zu einer ganzen Kette entwickelt. 
Wie mir Einheimische erzählten war das Ziel, ein ganzes Mittagessen komplett zwischen zwei Scheiben Toast unterzubringen. 
Das ist ja schon sehr praktisch, wenn man Steak, Salat und Fritten direkt auf einmal in sich reinschieben kann und es einem nichts ausmacht, wenn man von einem Ohr bis zum anderen mit dem halben Belag dekoriert ist.
Ich hab mich dann für die Variante 'Tuna' (6.50$) entschieden, was sich allerdings nicht gerade als sinnvoll erwiesen hat. Vielleicht wars der Jetlag oder das leckere Sam Adams, bei Tuna hatte ich an ein Thunfisch gedacht. Nun ja, es war eher eine Thunfischpaste oder sowas, mit Krautsalat, Fritten, Gurken und was weiß ich nicht alles.
Hat eigentlich nur noch die Apfeltorte obendrauf gefehlt.
OK, es war ein sehr lustiger Abend. Das junge Personal hatte auch seinen Spass, als wir das ganze auf Bildern festgehalten hatten.
Restaurant würde ich es nicht nennen. Mit der ganzen Baseball/Basketball Dekoration und den zahllosen TVs an den Wänden, Spielautomatem (und passenderweise gleich dem Geldautomaten daneben) läuft es bei mir eher unter Schnellimbiss.
Auch war man mit der Tischreservierung für 12 Personen schon etwas überfordert.
Es gibt auch eine reichhaltige Auswahl an Vorpseisen (4-5$; gefüllte Jalepenos, Nachos, Hühnchenstreifen, Champignons, ..., natürlich alles schön frittiert). Die Preise sind für diese Art Schnellimbiss durchaus OK.

After hearing all the buzz about this place, I decided to check out what the hype is all about.  It was Sunday Brunch and we arrived around 1pm.  The line was loooooong but that was expected.  Once seated at the table, my husband and daughter decided to tackle the ONCE AGAIN LONG LINE at the meat carving station while I decided to tackle the shorter line at the seafood station since I was already starving at this point.   While chowing down on the SUPER SALTY crab legs, I wondered where my husband and daughter were since they still haven't sat down to eat with me.   It nearly took them 30 minutes standing in line at the meat carving station!!  By the time they joined me at the table, I was ready to sample the rest of the food.  I then walked all the way towards the back to the Asian section (by the way the flow of the buffet just doesn't make sense!) to maybe try some sushi or sashimi.   There weren't that many good sushi selections either that's all they has or they just don't replenish fast enough.   I decided to skip the Asian section and walk my way towards the front.  I wanted some cured meats and cheese, but yet again the Parmesan cheese was a whole big block -no shavings or pieces one would have easy access to.  I was looking around for a knife maybe I thought one had to shave the cheese off himself, but no tool was around!  I was really getting frustrated at this point, but I still decided not to give up and try the meat carving station.  I had wishful thinking that the line was going to be shorter this time than when my husband and daughter were here.  Needless to say, the line was not any faster but at this point this was my last resort the last station i want to try since they have Prime Rib - my favorite, so I patiently wait for my turn.  Finally I get Prime Rib with Au Jus on my plate and  FINALLY join my family at the table, to only find out they are ALREADY DONE EATING!  I don't blame them since I was gone for almost 30 minutes!!!   To top it all off, the Au Jus that soaked my Prime Rib was sooo salty that I could only eat 3 bites out of that meat!  I was enraged at this point that I didn't even care to try their desserts!    Not being able to eat at the same time with my family because of the ridiculously long lines at the food stations and to be fed salty dishes is just absurd!   All in all, Bachannal Buffet DOES NOT live up to the hype!   The food is so much better elsewhere!  You're better off going to The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmo or The Studio B Buffet at The M Resort.

I could not have a more different opinion of this place from the other 2 reviews. It literally put me off of Indian food for long time. I did not find the food to be terribly fresh, as though it had been sitting in those chafing dishes for hours. It looked completely unappetizing, and tasted oily and bland. After a few bites I stopped eating.... they certainly got their money's worth out of me considering I ate pennies worth of nan bread and a few bites of food! 

I tried to keep my dining partner good company... he happily ate for 2 and didn't share my sentiments, but I've since spoken with several Montrealers who reassured me that Buffet Maharaja pales in comparison to other Indian restos in the city, upscale (Le Taj, Bombay Palace) and bargain (Bombay Mahal- excellent) alike. On the bright side, the service was good and the atmosphere comfortable.

We had to give this a 2, because, as others have posted, the service was pretty slow and something less than friendly. We were there on a Saturday, so it wasn't super busy. The food was fine, so if you want Korean and aren't fussy on the service, it could work for you. The larger question we discussed was should ethnic restaurants honour their culture when it comes to customer service or should they reach to be more consistent with their customer base? Also, we were left wondering if Koreana BBQ's preferred customer base was indeed Koreans as opposed to a wider and more diverse customer base. Just food for thought.

I recently ( a few  weeks ago) experienced horrendous service from FFSI in closing my loan.  It was extremely frustrating being asked multiple times for the same docs and having my closing date delayed at least twice due delays on their part ( they actually contacted my seller and explained that they were the reason for the closing delay).  The final mixup was on the day of closing when they included impounds in my final payment when a i had clearly requested and  signed documents saying I did not.  They acknowledged the error and  told me the docs would have to go back to underwriting again, thus causing another delay in closing. I knew that my seller would not go for a 3rd delay and I knew I had a good deal on the table.  I was told that the  impounds could possibly be removed during the servicing process, so I accepted the current situation and closed the loan with the mpounds to eliminate my risk.  I was not happy.  I  am still waiting to see if they will actially remove the i mpounds, but am not hopeful.  .  I am very disappointed and would not recommend FFS to anyone.

A friend  recommended this new place to try. I got the famous PBJ burger,it wasn't what I expected  it to be it was just that PBJ sandwich  with meat I don't know what all the fuss  was about. Let's talk about the waiter  it took him 10 min. before  he evan asked what we would like to  drink  and even longer to ask about our order. I guess  since this location  was in Scottsdale  he thought it would be better to attend the older ladies that were there alone rather than a  family. The service  for me means a lot about a place, but the food was ok. I would not be going there again.

First time here. The food was great loved the ribs the best I have ever tasted. Also the strawberry  lemonade delish. The only thing I did not like was it seemed that  our waiter was rushing us to hurry up. We were all still eating  he came over and asked if we wanted a box for leftover whhhat  is that!!! Then after we said in a bit,he came over again and asked if we wanted dessert while we were still eating :( other then that the food was great

I asked to get the sleeves of my nice wool coat taken out.  I paid $30, which is not that cheap for this kind of work. The work was so sloppy that the hemming started falling apart as soon as I got home and I also noticed a hole in the pocket that wasn't there when I had dropped my coat off. Honestly, the work was a hack-job. If you have any really nice/expensive items of clothing, do NOT take it here or you risk having to get the work re-done elsewhere. Really disappointed with the services after having read such positive reviews.

I love the seafood pho here. It tastes fresh and has a good portion of toppings other than just noodles. The service here is very poor. I have seen them take orders for larger parties before the smaller ones who had been waiting longer. Also, the servers quite frequently forget your orders and you will have to flag and repeat your orders numerous times. I also find it very odd that they seat "Canadian-looking" people on one side and Asian ones on the other.

The Bánh cuon  and chicken pho are my go-to staples here. The Bánh cuon is fresh and the portion is good but could use a little more filling however. The chicken pho broth is clean and not-oily unlike some other places. Sometimes, however, when ordering the pho, they cut the chicken pieces a little too think, and these pieces are also very dry. On a more positive note, there are no weird chicken pieces, they are all breast/white meat. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you haven't tried it yet.

Ate at Agio tonight and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was! I was also taken aback that a Korean chef would be cooking Italian cuisine. This was very judgmental and offensive on my part and I learned my lesson. Having been trained in Italy, Chef Marino may appear to be Korean but he speaks fluent Italian and cooks some of the best and authentic food I have ever had in my life. My SO and I had the bruschetta and the frutti de mare pasta. He also served us a complimentary melon and prosciutto appetizer as well as a delicious tiramisu dessert. It was our first time here and will certainly not be the last. Many thanks to the other Yelpers for this recommendation and I would highly recommend this spot to anyone who loves authentic Italian cuisine!

It was my mom and I's first time coming here. After reading the great reviews, and having friends that come here- we thought we should give it a try! My nails were severely damaged after having acrylics on, and Nessie recommended I do a hard gel manicure to give my nails some strength, and ultimately, make them grow again. The manicure came out perfect! Plus, her and I had great conversation. She's such a sweetheart! My mom went to Jimmy for a gel fill, although he didn't talk much, my mom is more than pleased with his work! It turned out fabulous. Needless to say, we have found our nail salon to go to! We can't wait to come back to Nessie and Jimmy. :)

I have heard a lot of good things that about Wynn Buffet being one of the best in Las Vegas since they open.  However, I haven't gotten a chance to try it until this time at 2011.  

I struggle over 30 min on what rating I should grade the Buffet at Wynn Hotel,  I don't know I should put 3 or 4 starts, for sure not 5 stars perfect rating.  Then, I settle with 3-star.  I'd like clarify, it is a 3-star within all the 5-stars hotels competition around in Las Vegas.   If you take about "general" rating, it may be 4-star, mainly due to atmosphere and service.    3-star is FOOD only, if good food and variety is what you are looking for.  Not to mention, I have to pay $46 per person to go in.  

Why 3-stars?  I think it failed in 5 main dishes.  1.)  The prime rib and honey-baked ham is too dry.   It almost has no juice in the meat.   2.) Seafood selection is poor, and the sea bass was over cooked.  It was too dry too.   Oyster was so small, and the spinach on top was only at room temperature.  other seafood selection is kind of limited.  I only see King-crab, sea bass, smoked salmon, and oyster.  3.) Asian and Japanese food is SUPER limited too, and doesn't taste very good.   4.) Italian food, so-so.    5.) the juice are not 100% flesh, they are from concentrated formula mixed with a flesh juice.  

Good thing the "Black pepper backed ham"  save the day, it was cooked carefully, and the meat was carefully selected.  It has a well balance of meat and a little fat to make it juice and smooth.     King crab is not bad.  They pre-cut them in half, making it a lot easier for us to eat.  Good job.  

One thing may worth mention about the choice of drinks.   You have a choice of buffet or buffet with Champagne.   What we didn't know, and our waiter didn't inform us, is that there are actually 3 different type of alcoholic blended drinks are offered with the standard buffet.  So, you have choices not only to soda, juice and coffee (Tea), you have at least 3 other choices (more expensive)... I forgot the name.  I will try to get them next time.

I feel very fortunate that I have tried a lot other 5-stars type of buffet around the world.  before, like Hyatt, Shangri-la, Four Season, Hillton,  Mandalay Bay at LV, Bellagio at LV, Mirage (back in the early 90s) ... etc    So, after having many of experience I had, I think a 3-star for food taste and choice is fair..    

I tried a 2 times in the week.  one for Breakfast / bunch.  One for dinner.  

On the side note, comparing to Wicked Spoon which I tried a few months ago.  I think Wicked Spoon offers more choices on the desert and and salad section..

Good luck on your choice and enjoy your meals.  :-)

I have given this store so many chances because I live close by and it is convenient for me to shop for my gluten free products.  I have given up. Service is so slow, cashing out takes forever. Rarely is there more than one cashier working, even on busy Saturday's! Occasionally when a second cashier does open she just takes cash or she just takes the last person in line while the people who have been in the line waiting get ignored. One time when this happened I walked over to the cashier and politely told her I was next in line and her comment was 'whatever' and a roll of her eyes. Absolutely no customer service skills. Also, selection is not what I am able to find at other comparable organic stores despite the distance I have to drive to get there. Lastly, the prices here are higher than other places. For example a local nonorganic supermarket down the road has some same products but a few dollars less. Planet organic hikes up their prices probably because they can get away with it I due to the higher end clientele they serve in port credit. I am giving this place no  more 'chances'.  I will take my business elsewhere even if u have to drive to central Mississauga.

I am very undecided about his place. Yes - it's convenient as I live close by - BUT the prices are ridiculous. I compared a couple of items from the local Fresh Co and Metro and Cousin's adds a couple of dollars to their canned/dry goods. Also their produce is overpriced such as their asparagus which is always a couple of dollars per pound more expensive then the other grocery stores close by. Their roast chicken, made on location, is ruined as it is slathered with horrible bbq sauce. In fact, most of their hot meat items are slathered in this sauce. Their customer service is simply deplorable. Their cashiers look miserable and pained even when they have to say the total price of your order. The parking is a mess. Very dangerous. Lastly, and certainly not least, the male employees noticeably come out and circle any good looking girl, woman, lady etc... that walks in to the store. I know this because it happens to me and makes me uncomfortable. They will slowly yet obviously start coming out of the back and the aisles and circle/pass by you a couple of times. I swear sometimes they are notified through walkie talkies or something that a 'female has entered the store' and they start coming out like vultures.

I have only tried their chocolate and vanilla gluten free cupcakes and both are great. I have only seen them in store on Satrudays but you can preorder gluten free cupcakes of your liking. A great place. Customer service is so-so. I asked the girl if their macarons were gluten free and she said " no they are made with pumpkin seeds." I made her clarify that she did indeed say pumpkin seeds (which are gluten free). I told her "You mean ground almonds" and she said "no pumpkin seeds." Anyway, left the store confused about their macarons and if they are gluten free.

Can't say enough about this place! Almost as soon as I walk in the people who work there ask if I need help. I can always find my vitamins/minerals/natural products. The back room has stevia, MCT oil, hemp hearts, Himalayan salt etc.....The only downfall is the parking - you have to pay for it but the good news is that it's about 50 cents for 20 mins and I usually don't need that much time for parking especially because of the great customer service. Sometimes there is 20% off so take advantage of this. Often the Loran Vanderhauge products are on sale too so take advantage of this as well.....Love this place!

Tried to attend a recent basketball game. Purchased General Admission tickets several weeks before the event for two elderly grandparents, two parents and two kids. Arrived 45 min early. Parking was a nightmare. Took 25 min to get from campus entrance to arena entrance. After getting to second floor of arena to access General Admission seating found all seats occupied and no standing room left! Clearly arean had been over sold by 500 to 1000 seats. Not only didn't we get to see the game people were crammed in the aisles and all around the back. Phoenix Fire Dept should have shut them down! Worse experience in many years. Guess the almighty dollar is more important than fair value for money rendered!

We ordered a new range hood and needed it installed for us.  Erik Dent installed it for us.  We told him when it would arrive and he was here the same day to install it.  He was very easy to work with regarding scheduling.  He came on time and worked fast and efficiently. He quoted a reasonable price on the phone and stuck to it, even though he did a few extra things because the wiring was old and needed updating.  Couldn't  be more please.  Had hired him several years ago which is why we chose him again. He did excellent work then and he still does.  Couldn't be more pleased!

I was so surprised to see a 3.5/5 stars on Yelp for this place, so I feel compelled to do a review. I've dined here several times and I have had nothing but great experiences. The food is always spot on. I guess you could say it's pricey, but I really don't take that into consideration unless the food is bad, and in this case it isn't. $60 per person is a solid average price, I think. More if you want a lot of drinks.

Wine list is really great. Go for the bottle rather than the glass.

The cake is out of this world. Always. Get. The. Cake.

This is one of the best spots in Madison for a dinner or even a small snack after work during the week. As far as Tory Miller restaurants go, this one is probably second or third best after L'etoile and possibly Graze (maybe a tie).

Decent prices for street food. The seating area is somewhat limited during peak dining times. It really irks me when groups of people come in and snag a table before ordering despite the long line. The seating issue would probably be better if they had a rule to order before sitting. 

Pork bowl was really good. Coffin toast is cute, but I was expecting a more robust flavor. Squid balls are a nice side.

On a good day, I give this place a 4. I really like the Cobb salad and their pastries. Service can be poor depending on who you get. When you're being attended to by a manager at the bar, it's great. But I've gone in several times and essentially been ignored for 10 minutes before getting a water or hello. 

I've also tried buying coffee beans here a couple of times and every time they've been out. 

Ok spot on the square if you're into light lunch fare. Don't expect to be blown away by service.

I went to the salon in person to discuss my needs and to schedule an appointment.  I spent a lot of time with the person at the front desk, making sure that I was matched with someone who would take the time to get to know me and the hair style that I wanted to achieve.  I was booked the following week with 2 different stylists.  One for hair color and another for a cut.  I showed up ON TIME.  I waited 15 minutes for the the colorist (Lauren) to greet me and start services.  I asked to speak to the lady who was going to cut my hair.  Everyone was rushed and no-one wanted to take the time to get to know me.  The colorist starting applying the color to my hair and informed me that there was not enough time for my hair cut. If I wanted to get my hair cut, I could come back another day or she could cut my hair.  The rudeness was unbelievable.  I was really looking forward to trying a new salon and stylist.  After much discussion, the manager came over and apologized.  I explained that the cut was the most important part of the day. Because there was not enough time for both, I opted to have the color washed out of my hair and have my hair cut with the person (leah) who I was scheduled with for the cut.  I waited 45 minutes for her, which meant I could have continued with the hair color and been fine with timing.  I came back the next day for Leah to color my hair. She barely said 5 words to me.  I paid $20 more for her to color my hair for a total of $85 for a root touch up.  There was NO offer by the salon for compensation for that fact that I had to come back to the salon TWICE.  The manager was nice and apologetic, but the attitude of the stylists was appalling.

My husband and I were celebrating our 23rd wedding anniversary weekend, and I suggested Blackthorne, as I have eaten there with friends, but he as never been to the restaurant.  We arrived a little after 6:30pm, and there was no one at the hostess stand to greet us.  We waited a few minutes, and then I popped my head around to the bar area, and caught the bartender's attention.  She looked at me and continued talking to two people at the bar.  She didn't bother to acknowledge our presence or to go and get someone to seat us.  The bar area, as well as the restaurant was fairly empty, with just a few tables of customers.  My husband and I continued to wait at the hostess stand, and then we were approached by a customer who wanted to know where the nearest gas station was located, so that he could go get some cigarettes.  Yes, we were standing there that long. I finally walked over to the bar and asked the bartender if we could be seated.  She told me to "wait a minute", to which one of the customers told me to relax and wait.  The customer then proceeded to spill a beer all over himself and the bar.  At that point the bartender reluctantly took us to a table.  I asked her to send a manager over to speak to us.  The manager came out and cleaned a table,  glanced our direction, and walked away.  When our server finally came to our table, I asked to speak to the manager.  He came to our table a few minutes later.  I asked if the bartender had let him know that we needed to speak with him,  His response, "she said that you all had been waiting a while, but didn't tell me that you wanted to talk to me."  SERIOUSLY.  What manager would not immediately go apologize to customers who had to wait in an empty restaurant to be seated at a table???  He gave a mild apology.  This is the worst service that I have ever received in a restaurant, and never mind that we spent $100 for dinner.

First time checking out this place tonight and it was very cool! Tonight we did an appetizer medley because we went early with our young son and just felt the need to explore the menu a bit. First of all we ordered our son's "fish sticks" to come first... Wow!! They were huge! He actually didn't eat them because he is not used to such fresh and delicious fish for his meal (18 months old) but we loved them! 
We also had the calamari, crab cake, lobster mac and cheese and a Caesar salad (for just 2 of us?! What were we thinking!) I would say the crab cake was the best! Lobster mac n cheese was really good but didn't live up to the hype I've seen on other reviews. Calamari and Caesar salad were good too. 
The service was amazing. We had a very attentive waitress and several other people delivering food, checking on us and clearing plates away! I love that kind of attention- they really want to make sure you are enjoying yourself. We ended with the creme Brûlée and it was delicious!! We ordered way too much food and have our left overs for tomorrow!! We will be going back for sure to try the pots! And maybe even the fried chicken!

Monica is the perfect fit hair stylist for me!! I give her complete control of my hair and she has never let me down. Recently, we did a Brazilian Blowout to help tame my crazy hair, and it worked out great! It made managing my hair so easy when I traveled to hot and humid NY. And even my Mom complimented my hair!!  That has NEVER happened. I send all my friends to Monica! We have so much fun at every visit!

I was lucky to be referred to Urban Wellness when I was pregnant over a year ago. I had, and continue to have regular massage visits with Alexis. She is very knowledgeable about all things woman! It is wonderful to have someone who understands your body and knows how to help you on a regular basis. I look forward to my regular visits, and I always feel like my needs have been met after each visit!! I highly recommend the many services available at Urban Wellness!

Dr. Steve was my final stop on my hunt to find a chiropractor in the valley. I moved to AZ several years ago and had to try many chiropractors until I finally found the right one!! Dr. Steve has helped to relieve my chronic back and neck pain, and he has also been very educating when it comes to health advice. Dr. Steve and staff are friendly and welcoming and I always enjoy my time there.

New to the area and have been trying some different places each weekend. We had one of their yummy burgers and a flat bread and they were both delicious.  Brought left over flat bread home and enjoyed again the next day. Loved the different choices on the menu, had a fun waiter and waiter in training and it was an enjoyable experience. We will return for sure!

It was the perfect little outing for our family. $10 for a child to get in, $3 for an adult. With the child admission you get a small pumpkin to decorate and a bag of stickers for decorating it. As well as access to a bouncy house, corn maze, and viewing animals. My 2 year old son loved running around and walking along with chickens/turkeys. He enjoyed climbing the massive dirt pile and investigating all of the pumpkins. He was in and out of the bounce house and had a fun time seeing the animals. We didn't spend our time decorating our pumpkin there because there was a lot of fun wandering around to do! It was a nice two hour morning outing to get him tired and hungry for lunch and a nap! We will be sure to return!

Just tried this place for the first time! Yummy! I am stuffed. Loved the garlic knots as mentioned before, also the antipasto was great! Good sized pieces of the yummy Italian meats you want in an antipasto. Pizza was great too and I am a picky Ny'er when it comes to pizza. Would have liked the crust to be a bit crispier, but it was still delicious! My son is still eating his kid's spaghetti as well! Tons of pasta for $5!! Did I mention I loved the garlic knots!

They didn't try to up sell me on anything, and didn't make me feel bad about having terrible cuticles and short toenails!!I had a pedicure and manicure together. You know the kind where they make you feel like a rock star by doing it at the same time! It has the small town shop kind of feel and I would return here for sure!

We have been going here since last year, June and usually they do a good job with our dog (long-haired dachshund). Today, he came back as a no-haired dachshund! (I think it was new staff working today) They made a mistake and shaved my little boy. My husband said the girl at the front was very rude (even if they made a mistake) plus insisting him to pay because they did what we asked for.(even if it was not what we wanted) I can't believe they shaved my dog and not even try to say sorry first. we called the owner of the shop and explained what happened. The owner apologized but, Honestly, we do not want to go to this store anymore and do not want to recommend to anybody we know. It is common sense that you apologize when you make a mistake. It seems like they don't even care for your dogs. Also, he is long-haired dachshund... Why the heck would we ask them to shave him completely off?!?!

Decided to check out this place with friends during our stay at SLS. The food was delicious. The noodles are made from scratch and you can taste the quality. My favorites were the Crispy Bao Bun and the Hakka Fried Rice Pot. It's a great place to have a family style kind of meal. Our server Alex was helpful in food recommendations and just amazing overall. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Vegas.

He is efficient and very thorough with a very reasonable fee. Purchasing from out of state can be a nightmare, but Greg made us feel great and now we know everything about this property.

It's not like King Spa in Chicago- it's small and cozy. For 20 bucks, you cannot complain. I would choose here any night if I needed a cheap place to stay! Well, I am used to sleeping on hard floors. 

Warning for overnighters: people do snore. Do not fall asleep in the hot sauna rooms. You can die or wake up very shriveled. The outside jjimjil room does get cold at night. I slept for about thirty minutes but my body told me to go into the toasty room that connects you to the sauna rooms. You should bring a wet towel, which will act as a humidifier in the hot room.

There are only two baths, but at the time I went, this was not a problem. There are enough showers and the steam room is big enough, in my opinion. I can't imagine what it would be like if a lot of people came to the sauna. I'd feel a bit cramped for sure .

Take a long, nice bath. Scrub out your anxieties, fears, and stress. Detox in the many sauna rooms! It's like Korean therapy. 
Being physically clean really correlates to feeling mentally clean. 

For 20 dollars, not bad at all!!

The restaurant is clean and accommodating for large groups of people. Servers are pretty Korean, as in they are more comfortable speaking Korean. Regardless, everything on the menu has an english translation. 

They offer a large variety of Korean food. Mainly hot soups, and traditional favorites like bibimbap and ddukbokki. 

Pretty good side dishes~ 
I recommend the mackerel dish. 
Bulgogi jungol is very delicious. So is the soondae guk. 
Rice is purple and yummy.
More than good enough for the price!

Come with someone who knows Korean so you can flag the waitresses down for refills.

If I could give no stars I would. I went to get a cut today and it seems to me the consistency for the dedication to quality is not across the board. As a business owner Tony your employees are a direct reflection of you and exuberate your persona. A customer looks for consistency not only in the barber but in the barber shop as well. I asked the employee who cut my hair today to "read the shape of my head. It appears this was a difficult task due to the fact that when I got home and looked at the work she had done nearly half of the top portion of my head was cut down to a one!!! The rest of it top portion had some length to it making my head look like it was completely butchered! A cut is suppose to be faded as it moves up to the crown of the head and from there should be well blended. The top of my head looks like a deformity because this person was not paying attention and did not take the time to provide great customer service. A barber should take pride in their work and take their time and know with out a doubt what they are going to do and communicate with the customer so that both parties are on the Same fucking page. How hard is that?! I will no longer be coming here as my confidence is shot in this place after today. I would recommend that you save yourself the trouble of coming here and do the same!!

AN ABSOLUTE MUST DO IF YOU TRULY LOVE YOUR DOG!

My boyfriend and I have a 5-month old German Shepherd puppy who has been and currently attends training, playtime, and grooming sessions here. 

Training: Matt, the owner of Romp, instructs all the training classes and we could not be happier with his "training with kindness" method. There are many ideas about what German Shepherds should be and do act like, but both my boyfriend and I found it truly important to make him the sweetest dog possible. We do not want a robot dog that loses all personality because of training via "being broken". Romp exceeds our expectations every time with this regard as, while learning to be obedient for safety and fun, our puppy grows his personality each and every week! It is amazingly spectacular! 

Playtime: Matt's highly professional and super caring staff always make our puppy feel loved and missed every week. It is almost like its his second home here, where all his friends live too. We absolutely love receiving his report cards at the end of each playtime, telling us what his "paw"sonality, what his favorite activity, who his best friend, and any room of imp"ruff"ment was that day. FYI...he's a straight A student so never any room for imp"ruff"ment here, but the staff will let you know if you need to work on something with your dog. Our puppy adores these play sessions and comes back exhausted from his long day of fun. I do have to say that I always speak to Savanna and she is the best! 

Grooming: Amanda always makes him look so cute! She really does a terrific job and has over 20 years of experience! What more can you ask for than that? Our German Shepherd puppy is extremely unique that loves being clean and looking his best, but tends to oppose being brushed and groomed at home. Somehow, I still do not know how!, Amanda gets him to not only tolerate these activities, but to want to be brushed and groomed all day long! It is so strange, but I am super grateful to her for her sixth sense!

Every where we go and everyone who interacts with our puppy always says how well behaved and what an outstanding temperament he has and it is in huge part due to Matt and his A team at Romp!

All in all, if you have a dog and have not taken him or her to Romp, you are doing a tremendous disservice to yourself and your pup. In other words, you would be crazy not to try this place! I can go on and on. 

Thank you Romp!

USE THIS COMPANY!

I recently had a last-minute move that was uncertain until the very last day. After calling numerous moving companies that all did not have availability for 2 weeks, I received a light at the end of the tunnel by putting faith in One Price Moving. Jeff, the owner, answered all my questions extremely professionally (and, I had many!) and assured me that I would be in good hands. He was completely right! He came to see my possessions that same day so that he could give me a realistic quote to move them. He 100% stuck to the quote given as well as sent over a contract to nail everything down in stone.

For all the little details, from giving me a ton of boxes, arranging for a storage facility just in case, sending over four super impressive movers, and granting all my wishes for the move, it grew to an extraordinary experience. There was not one phone call not answered, question not addressed, and complication not resolved instantly. Additionally, if I was not thrilled enough with Jeff, his skilled movers tipped the scale to having absolutely no doubt that I made the right decision to use One Price Moving. They not only moved, installed, built, hung, and addressed absolutely every item that needed it until all was perfectly in place, but did everything with a smile on their faces and great work ethic. It was an absolute pleasure dealing with this company and I hope that you have the honor of working with them sometime soon too!

TRUST THIS COMPANY! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED, BUT RATHER ABSOLUTELY ECSTATIC!!!

Okay, so remember when I said Epic couldn't get the job done the first time they tried in my apartment complex? Well...Brett, the owner, called me the next day and refused to accept that and talked out multiple ways we could approach the carpet cleaning. You know how people say when there's a will, there's a way? Brett truly makes that quote a reality! So he send over one of his guys again and guess what? My carpets now look like brand new because EPIC DID GET IT DONE! 

I am SO happy! Brett, thank you for not giving up!

Annie, the owner of the salon portion, is ABSOLUTELY...THE BEST! She really knows her stuff about hair and is a color correction specialist. Before I moved out to Arizona (originally grew up in NY), my hair was bleach blonde and I never liked it. My hair dresser back in NY LOVED blonde and so kept making my hair lighter with each visit. I did not have the heart to yell at her and say "stop coloring my hair the color YOU want it to be". When I met Annie, the experience was ENTIRELY different!!! The first thing she asked me was what I envisioned for my hair color, what I did not like about it, and how I thought it would be perfect. Another thing she said was that anytime I was bored with my hair to feel free to tell her and she would revolutionize it again. She stayed true to her promise in the now two years that I have been seeing her. I also LOVE that if I want something new done to my hair and it is not fashion forward, she will work with the idea until it is. It always comes out even better than the original thought!!! I keep telling her that she needs to start her own product line too so hopefully that is to come soon!!! :D

As far as the vintage portion...Miles runs that. It always has intriguing items that are not what you would expect to find just anywhere. I have personally not made a purchase yet, but my colleague and I went to 3rd Thursday and she bought a door for $5!!! There is not even where to have lunch for that price! Miles gave her helpful suggestions as to how to recreate the door into a unique piece of art with either using pictures and turning it into a giant frame or using it as a room divider. Pretty cool!!! I am excited to see what my first purchased item will be someday! 

Annie and Miles are an unstoppable team! Go visit!

I will absolutely NEVER go to iPic again!!!

I had been SO excited to go to this theatre with my boyfriend. I had been telling him for 8 months that we had to go to this theatre because I took the tour, knew about it through work, and just loved the whole idea. My boyfriend is a very "let's do everything last-minute" type guy, and so it literally took us that much time to finally get into this theatre for a movie. If you want to go, reserve your spot at least a few days in advance. 

Anyway, we finally got in and saw Jack Ryan. The tickets were NOT worth the money to sit in this "exclusive" theatre. We decided to make a full date of the experience and also have dinner at the theatre. My boyfriend's food and soda came about 30 minutes before the movie ended (around 9:00pm) and I was not so lucky, my food and water never arrived!!! My boyfriend and I both asked the waiter several times when my food and water would arrive, when we could find him that is, and nothing! I asked the waiter to at least bring me some water (I was super dehydrated already) and...NOTHING!!! Finally, at the end of the movie, we complained to the waiter and he said he would get a manager. Guess what? A manager NEVER CAME!!! As I told my boyfriend that night, the difference in the comfort of the seats versus a Harkins or AMC is not large enough for me to overlook the extreme disappointment of having to wonder where the waiter is at every moment. I do not even know what happened in the movie!!! That is how preoccupied I got with where the waiter was, where the food was, and if I was even going to have water to drink!!! 

All in all, the seats are comfortable, of course, if not the theatre would not bring in any business, but I strongly recommend that you just invest in a recliner for your home instead. It is way less frustrating!

Moved to AZ from NY almost a year ago now; when I first got here, I went to FOUR different nail salons asking for the "pink and white" (basic french tip manicure) with LIQUID gel.  (Not just regular gel polish).  NONE of the other salons knew what they were doing!
  
I finally wised up and found Angel nails where I met John...He is AMAZING and so is the rest of the staff.  If you are looking for someone who REALLY knows how to do "liquid gel" nails, John is your guy!  Not only is John nice, but it's a family business.  Angela (the receptionist is a sweetheart and is always very helpful.)

As far as the rest of the team - the pedicures are AMAZING!  I love the Coconut pedi, Lavender pedi and Cucumber pedi.  All are amazing!  The place is immaculate and very sanitary. 

I moved from Surprise and now live in Scottsdale, but I still go to see John and his team every two weeks - I won't go anywhere else to get my nails done.  

I highly recommend them to anyone; in fact quite a few women from my office have started to go see John and his team as well.

I found Ramon Bacaui Hair salon almost a year ago before moving from NY to Arizona.  I had SoCap hair extensions before I moved, and did some research and found Ramon's salon.  

I have NOT been disappointed in the least!  He is a master at what he does and is well worth the money.  He just doesn't "do hair" --- he creates masterpieces.  I've had two more sets of hair extensions done by Ramon and NO ONE even knew I had extensions, they looked THAT good and THAT natural.

I had the extensions removed for the summer, and continue to go and get my hair cut and colored by Ruby (Ramon's sister).  She is fabulous as well!  They certainly know what they are doing and they are just simply amazing and so sweet and kind.  

I would highly recommend this salon if you are considering extensions, if you have damaged hair or just need a new look.

Went to Estrella ONCE for Liquid Gel nails.  The girl did not have a CLUE as how to do REAL liquid gel nails.  Not even 24 hours after getting my pink and white "liquid gel" nails done, they were cracking and chipping.  

Went here once and ONLY once.  Never will return.  Found a MUCH better nail salon.

The quality and QUANTITY of SNS they have is amazing and the skills their technicians possess are superior to any others that I have tried.  Also the attention to detail is superb! I highly recommend stopping in and checking out VIP BN Nail & Spa.

5 STARS . Excellent Service  It is a very GOOD place, Nicely Decorated. I tried the indian food for the first time and it was very delicious. Service was excellent and the waiter was Awesome with complete knowledge of food and spice levels. Astush (if I spelled it right) was our Server and was Super friendly. He recommended me the Chicken Tikka Masala for Medium Spicy and Lamb Vindaloo for my husband who wanted to eat spicy. Food was great and the Service made our night awesome. I would Recommend this place to everybody I know.

If you're into dive bars and just normal guys sitting around drinking, this is your place. Being from out of town I obviously didn't know anyone, however, the regulars seemed to be having a good time. The bartender was friendly and poured me a nice stiff drink. A bit off the strip, but a good place to check out if you have time.

La Brioche is beautiful inside.  The food is good, borderline great.  The baked goods and cakes look better.  However, I will NEVER be able to get over how HORRIBLE the service is.  I have given La Brioche my " 3 strikes" policy, hoping that the bad service might be a fluke, but by reading the other reviews and by my own experiences, it seems like a trend.  The servers look like they are on a fast sinking ship, they are totally unaccommodating, totally rude and need to study up on what they are serving.   I feel like if the service is bad, why bother trying to make everything else great.
I give La Brioche one star and I think I am being very generous.
I feel like no matter how good an establishments food is, if the service is not up to par, it doesn't matter.

I have bought every piece of camera equipment I own from The Camera Store. I literally walked into the store with absolutely no idea of what I wanted, or what anything was or how anything worked at all. I explained my situation (wanting an affordable, reliable DSLR, etc.) and the assosiate was able to help me pick the perfect set up. Even 3 years later I have never had a problem with the product. 
They have a great rental option - which has helped me throughout the years. I have rented mics and lenses for great prices.
I guarentee they have the best prices in town - I always end up having to ask other stores if they can match the prices.

Great staff, amazing selection of product, and great service.

I love The House. I always have as long as I can remember. Firstly, their products are very high quality. The coffee is delicious, espresso is perfect, they offer all different types of milk, and the food is just as great. Not to mention - they also have tasty smoothies.

They are definitely a little disorganized these days. I know that the shop is run by the Alliance Church and that they try to hire younger people who are involved with faith/community. However - sometimes I find the volunteers/employees to be very disorganized. And though they are always very friendly - sometimes they really just don't have it together. 

The shop puts on various different events every day of the week - which keeps it interesting. They have open mics on Thursdays for all ages, shows on Fridays/Saturdays, film viewings, AA meetings, different speakers, playtimes for Moms/Kids. They are a truly fantastic organization with great products. Maybe a little weak in organization but generally 4/5.

There is no better shawarma in the city. They add the perfect ingredients - nothing too obscure, but still enough flavour. It doesn't take much to order - they just grab your name and off you go. It's not too greasy, full of flavour, and though it's a little messy - it is quite the satisfying meal. 

I crave Jimmy's. I tell everyone to go there, it's simply fantastic.

I'm such a fan of this pub. Firstly, it's adorable. Nothing feels more like home than walking into a tiny little character house for a pint. I like that they serve relatively local brews. 

It's kind of a mixed crowd. I like it mostly when it's empty. You can sit on the deck upstairs - or play some pool. Very relaxed atmosphere. 

Also - the nachos are SUPER great. Add chicken on top of them and they are DELICIOUS.

I love all the different varieties of tea that are available here. And every single tin I have purchased has been fantastic. The baristas are all extremely helpful when you need help finding something you would like, as well. 

It's not too expensive - considering the quality. I tend to avoid the food though, since it seems quite over priced for what they are offering. Something like $8.00 for a grilled cheese? I've had them and they're great, but maybe not $8.00 kind of great. 

The tea is great though. The matcha is the best in the neighbourhood and the staff is exceptional. Always a pleasant time here.

I love this place. 

I will get the bad out of the way first... There isn't a good day to go where you won't have to wait in line for a good 15-20 minutes at least. But Saturday/Sunday are definitely the worst - and don't even bother going on holidays. 

However, it's completely worth the wait. The food is amazing. Everything is fried in duck fat - which only after eating here did I realize how much better I felt after eating it. I love that I can stuff my face with this beautiful food and not feel like I drank a bucket of grease after. You leave feeling full, without having to fear the food baby you are carrying around all afternoon. 

My favourite thing is the French Toast. I get it almost every single time I'm there. It's quite light. It's sweet - but not too sweet. It has a nice orangey zest to it, and served with warm maple syrup. Delicious.

I could eat here every day. You get your money's worth completely.

Honestly, I'm quite the sugar tooth. So, though I rated this place a 3/5 - there is a reason. 

I like to get the bad out of the way first. One particular visit last summer, I was selecting my usual 12 dollar assortment of candy, and there were about 7 or 8 wasps/bees flyer around in the bins I was going through. 

I mentioned it, without freaking out obviously - because of course insects are attracted to sugar, but I just thought the staff didn't know. All they did was glare at me and say "yeah it happens all the time". UH WELL MAYBE DO SOMETHING TO MAKE IT NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME. I don't want no fricken wasp candy man, I'm scared of that shit!

Otherwise - I love it here. It's not too crazy of a selection, but it's good as far as Calgary and even Canada go for unique sugar selection. A little expensive though for things that are widely available. I understand the mark up on things like vanilla coke/other imported products. But I'm pretty sure I pay 0.73 cents for pop rocks and the Shell across the street. Rethink that one guys!

Also, the staff always look so miserable...

This place is really one of the few I would splurge on for a lunch this summer! The service was very fast and friendly and I felt welcomed when coming here alone for lunch. I ordered the Citrus Asian Salad and paired it with the Italian Sandwich and it cured my coffee shakes! I also ordered a lemonade and a freshly baked cookie, and I honestly never splurge like this on a lonely lunch. Great ambiance whether you want to sit outside or inside :)

My first time coming to this nail salon since we just moved to the area from a couple miles away.  I requested a gel manicure and spa pedicure with callous remover. I was very disappointed with my experience. I was there for over 2 hours. My manicurist didn't dry my feet or legs before putting lotion on and didn't provide the full service. The lady next to me had got stones and a nice leg massage... needless to say I did not revive that and my callous is still very visible. My manicure was a complete disaster. My nails were not fully painted and the manager just told me to come back whenever I want to get it fixed. He didn't bother to really take a look or apologize. I will not be refunding. I should have known it was not going to be a great experience when I walked in and there're was only one customer. Usually Saturday's at my original salon are packed. I do not recommend.

We can't thank both Willie and Lisa for everything they have done for our rescue dog Chance. They went above and beyond making sure he was completely ready before sending him home after the board and train program. I truly enjoy taking him in the car and for walks now. This is what having a pet is all about. I feel so fortunate to have found Willie and Lisa and will forever be thankful! It's honestly worth every penny to invest in training your dog properly. They love what they do and it shows. Thank you again Off Leash K9! Keep up the amazing work!

I wouldnt call this a 5 star hotel, it is definitely nicer than the lower end hotels like the Linq.  But its a HUGE hotel, rather noisy because we can hear our neighbors phone conversation.  Its a standard nice, but nothing really wow'd me about the hotel itself.  I do like how it doesnt smell like cigarette smoke like other hotels.

Not the place to go for a nice dinner. Cocktails were pretty good ( st Germain recommended, the pineapple one not so much). The food was not the best. One vegetable dish we ordered was delicious, the fries were underwhelming, and the meat was overpriced and not that good. I'd recommend this place for drinks but not food. Also bf and I were having stomach problems the next day, dunno if related ...

I'm giving three stars mostly because I'm a big fan of Starbucks drinks, but this experience is certainly not the best. I wanted to order a latte macchiato, and I don't think the lady at the cashier knew they even have this drink at first. She first put cafe latte on the machine, and I saw it and corrected it. Then I was trying to personalize my drink a bit with less ice and almond milk. After I finished my request, the lady asked me again whether I was ordering a caramel macchiato. I corrected her again that I wanted a latte macchiato. Okay, then it finally showed the right drink on the cashier. I thought this was the end of the story but NO. The guy who was making my drink held a manual with his left hand the entire time while he was making my drink with only his right hand. I even saw him made a mistake at first and started over for my drink. Finally, I got my drink, but the taste was not good as it should taste since I had the same drink several times from another Starbucks store at CU. I understand this is a new Starbucks store, and they are obviously new hires who need a lot of practice. But they clearly need more training before serving real customers. How can employees not even remember the drinks on the menu (I'm definitely not ordering a very wired customized drink)? I hope the manager can pay more attention to the training standards of the employees.

Love this place! To be honest, usually pizza is not among the top options when I eat out with friends, but I'm glad we went to this place. Customized pizza, OMG, never thought about we could do this at CU, particularly after so many times of those regular pizzas. Also, I in general prefer thin crust, so this place is perfect for me. The only small problem I have with this place is because they have the oven out, so I think there was a bit of smoke, esp during the rush hour, which made my eyes somehow uncomfortable after seating inside for a while. So I may think about taking out next time.

The food is fine, but the service sucks. 
We came for a late lunch, and there were only two tables including us. The guy (I believed it's the owner) came to our table several times just standing and staring at us while we are still looking at the menu, which was so creepy. I told him we needed more time to decide but it looked like he didn't understand me and came by again before we were ready to order. I felt like being rushed to order.
Then the food came, and they were fine. But the bill came when we were in half eating, and the guy just dropped the bill on our table saying nothing. That was sooooooo RUDE.

Home town feel.  Simple menu with great variety and generous servings.  Lots of locals  and farmers, not modern or fancy or big, but great home style cooking, open until 2 pm.  My wife pretty much only eats breakfast two places, The Sheep Camp in Buckeye  and Ronnie's Cafe in Phoenix on 43rd Ave.  Friendly service and good food in a relaxed non-commercial setting.

I went here during my visit to Calgary...

The first big plus is that they are open late. It seemed like everywhere downtown sort of shuts down at 9pm. I was really hungry after a play and Original Joe's came to the rescue. 

I had the Thai-style Salad and it was very good. The grilled chicken, noodle and cashew nut mix  was an unexpected combination... but it tasted great with the sauce. 

It is a place I will visit again.

This hotel (motel) is hands-down the worst I have ever stayed in. I booked it through Orbitz, where it was listed as a 3-Star hotel and was elated to be getting a great deal... of course it was too good to be true.

The entrance/office was absolutely nothing like the pictures... you sort of had to stretch your imagination to see the semblance from the pictures. 

The rooms were simply drab, complete with hideously patterned sheets and curtains (I can't place what decade they were from). The pillows: imagine a $3.00 Walmart pillow, that has been used 50 times. The room also had an annoying odor, like an old abandoned warehouse. The window A/C unit was one of those from the 1960's (may be not quite that old), with shabby faded wood panelling, and it was plugged into a socket that was falling off the wall. The TV: half the stations were static ridden images. The room was connected to a balcony- (a shared one). But, you guessed it.... you would not want to step into the balcony or leave your dog roaming there... Of course it smelt pretty bad because it was covered in a lime green carpet, that had not been cleaned in maybe 5 years.

And do not be deceived by the free breakfast. I was dreaming of a continental spread with eggs, sausage... Far from it, the fruit basket  contained 20% soft rotting apples, the bread tray- the bread seemed recycled from 3 days (think of the hardened texture of bread that has been left out overnight). Needless to say I was too scared to try the coffee or milk; all I could stomach was the orange juice.

As far as location: The only plus is that it is close to a train stop, with easy access to downtown. Otherwise, there are couple of other motels in the area and nothing else; I mean NOTHING.

Here are the only positives: Thankfully the sheets seemed clean and there were no roaches or rats; the bathroom was decent; and the wireless internet worked.

Please do not fall for this miserable place. I payed $85 for the night and wanted all but 100 pennies back.  I have not stayed in a 1-star motel, but I suspect this place will make some 1-star places look stellar. I know its sort of a harsh review, but it is completely true to my experience there. Give it a try and you'll see for yourself!

Ben Correa helped us to sell our NV house while we relocated to TX three months ago; because the owners are out of state, Ben picked up alot of extra duties such as checking on the house, changing lock, managing contractors (we did a little touch up work before selling) and coordinating different   parties that were in the state, out of the state and outside the country! Never hear him complains and always on top with the next action plan. Ben has many years of real estate experiences and extensive networks that will guarantee a solid result, whether you are buying or selling. He shared his honest, professional opinions regarding the market trend and helped us come up with a strong listing; we had couple offers within three days on the market and we ended up in a favorable sale (pending) only one week of listing. We sailed smoothly after that; the house was sold without drama per the agreed closing. We have also used Ben for buying a short sale house which requires more paperwork and negotiation. He tackled them all efficiently! What can you ask for more in a realtor? Ben is our only choice; we are very demanding clients but both transactions we were very pleased with the results. Oh and he truly value each clients' need and treat us like friends.... I think it's a no brainer for me to say, "yes, i highly recommend Ben Correa!".

Culver's does have good fast food but beware of drivethru.  Back in May, part of our order was not put in bag.  Living thirty minutes away, I called and the manager promised to mail a coupon voucher, to replace items not received.  This was in April.  To date, have not received.  Multiple emails unanswered.  #customerservicefail

Never. Ever. Again.  Service was lousy- large party- but they knew we were coming.  Reservations but did not matter.  Took an hour for even the drink order. Over an hour for food - then another hour to get the bill.  Food was not the greatest either.  Gave it a shot-we won't be back.

I love this place, one of my favorites in the West end. I like that their noodles a little wider and fresh. They are pretty quick, and the broth is consistent. For those of you who enjoy their soup on the spicier side, they have a couple chilli oil jars kicking around. which is a big bonus for me, seeing as i bring my own sometimes to pho places that don't have them. i'm pretty much a regular there.

This is my local pho spot on the Plateau.. Ohhh and they now deliver :)  They're always consistent and I find the prices good for a Vietnamese restaurant. The food is is fresh and I know I can count on a good bowl of pho when I'm craving it. Broth is usually flavourful and they also have great Bun. I'm glad it's around the corner from me!

The first time I went to Oasis I had the oxtail and a side of fresh salad. It was delicious and I'll definitely be back for more. The oxtail had lots of meat on it and was perfectly cooked. The place itself is cute and cozy with a 'ma and pa' type feel to it, which I prefer. So if you are looking for home-cooked Jamaican style dishes, it's worth checking out. The owner is lovely, she is super sweet and charming. Oh and yes, her  home-made hot sauce is bomb.

Group of 7 for a Sunday brunch.

Step 1.  order 7 caesars.  received 5.  was felt to be responsible for said error.

Step 2.  ordered a mimosa.  order was refused on the grounds of it being "to classic".  was in turn up sold to a 14 dollar drink.

Step 3.  ordered an assortment of egg dishes for the table - all were incorrectly or incredibly over-cooked.  again, was felt to be responsible for the missteps.  this doesn't even compare to the preparation of the pork belly which were essentially jerky.  or worse.

Step 4.  the tomatoes were great.  

Step 5. THE CAESAR'S WERE 11 DOLLARS!

Step 6.  as such, it was 100 dollars per couple for what was an entirely unsatisfactory brunch experience.

Step 7.  we will never go there again. ever.

Hiii, I'm Laotion and I just moved to Montreal recently and was one day craving Lao food. I decided to look up Laotion resto's in Montreal..I wasn't expecting anything buuut BAM! I found one :) It's not close to where I live but I decided to metro up to Cote Vertu and to my surprise the food is really authentic :) 

I've had the papaya salad, chicken wings, tom yum soup, pho, lab and Laos Sausages. I love it all. I'm ecstatic there's a place that has some of my favourite dishes that no other restaurant in the city has. I go at least  once every couple weeks when I get cravings for a home cooked meal. 
Beware, if you asked for the papaya salad spicy..you'll get it spicy! I like the way they use crab paste in there too to give it that extra fishy taste the way I like it. (Most Lao people eat it like this)
The atmosphere is pretty simple and easy, prices are decent. I like hearing the women cooking and and talking in the kitchen, makes me miss talking Lao to my family. Things are fresh and made to order so if you're in a rush it's not the place to go to.

Horrible service. 2 other tables in restaurant . Waited over 30 minutes for food and drinks. Drinks were not brought out with food or before food. Had to wait another 10 minutes for drinks. Staff only starred at us while we ate and had to wait another 10 minutes after done eating for the server to come over and give us the check. Food was ok small portions. Never going back!

I got helped out by Jorge Moreno and got some awesome service! I was impressed, his first time helping me out and he won my trust with an astonishing cut and some great customer service. 

Now i have been coming here for a couple months and by far i can tell you this is the BEST barbershop in Chandler. I wouldn't even think about going to another shop. 

Jose is my favorite barber no doubt!! I mean this guy puts his soul and heart into all his cuts, if you have the pleasure of getting your fade done by him consider it a blessing.  
I would highly recommend to set up a appt with them because they are often busy.

Very good food!  (I've eaten almost everything here seeing as I live within walking distance)The cold sandwiches have A LOT of meat on them, almost to much.  I usually have to take so much off that I could make another sandwich.  If you are on a diet or want something lighter get the steak salad.  It may sound weird if you read it off the menu but it's Delish!  Oh, and of course, the Philly cheese steaks are pretty unique and gooooood :)

The best family dollar on South Blvd.  They have a friendly environment store crew. They always have a smile on their face no matter what and no matter how hard life gets to them.  They do their very best to keep up with the customers and they have the best G4S security working for them as well for second shift. The store crew members know what it takes to work in retail and they clean their store daily :)

I recently had another birthday and happily started my evening at Papago.  The best thing about this place is that you can trust they will always have something new and really really fantastic on tap to try out.  You would think that would be a given, with 30 taps available.  But I just get this good feeling that they put a lot of heart, and hours of tasting (rough) into surprising and pleasing their patrons with the choices.
I've enjoyed every visit I've made to Papago, but those guys made it very special for my special day.
I haven't had the opportunity to try the food yet. Next time, I promise!

I have been working at the ASU campus for a little over a year and I've visited Dave's about 5 or 6 times.  I was never very excited about their beer or food, but I love supporting local brewpubs, and I liked the atmosphere. Especially the patio and outdoor bar.
I have a pretty forgiving palate when it comes to craft beer, but Dave's just falls flat. No complexity of flavor in any of the beers, although I haven't tried the stout. They aren't bad, they just have nothing to stand out.
But the reason I decided to write this review is that I was tremendously disappointed during my last visit in early Feb.  Since I work nearby my visits have often included lunch or happy hour food, and I thought they had a decent selection of affordable options. But they removed some of my go-to vegetarian items from the menu.  When I expressed my disappointment, the bartender told me they took the veggie items off because they weren't selling as much.  I can see why a restaurant might stop advertising a item that is not selling.  But there are few replacement options when you start removing vegetarian choices.  In addition, when I asked if they still made the veggie wrap at all, the bartender simply said no.   I hate the thought of being high maintenance, so I didn't press the issue. But I imagine that it wouldn't have been that difficult to do.
Since the waitstaff was not interested in my satisfaction, and since the other food I have tried (bar food, typical salad) is just average and I prefer other beer, I won't be back.

I came to Class Fitness over a year ago after I injured my ankle and had to take a break from running. I started with rowing, which I had never done before, and signed up for a full membership within a month.
Rowing is an incredible total body workout that quickly improves your performance in all athletic activities.  When I finally started running again, I was surprised that I was doing better than before my injury! I would never have stuck with it and developed this appreciation if it wasn't for Morten. I can't imagine a more knowledgeable and devoted rowing coach- an opinion shared by every student I've met in his classes.
Since joining I've added spinning, boot camp and yoga to the list of classes I regularly attend. The schedule is perfect for me (early mornings, but there are evening classes as well) and I always look forward to starting my day with this group. Taking a spin or boot camp class from Linda is fun and inspiring.  She accomplishes an unbelievable amount every day, but nothing ever weakens her contagious passion for fitness.  The community of members is great too, and there are always opportunities to join others for local events like races.
As a person used to just getting up and running for my exercise, I never thought I would want or need to join a gym. But I am so happy I did. At Class Fitness I've found friendship, accountability, and new adventures!

A decent substitute for Pita Jungle. Prices are a bit high for what you get compared to Pita Jungle. I have only ever gotten Togo food. I imagine it can sometimes be unpleasant to eat there.

Haven't been in a few months, but I have been meaning to post my review. My office is down the road and we used to visit Grazie on a regular basis. Also a great place to take a date. Pizza is always excellent. Love the taste and texture. I read a review before I started this post. Ummm "Christine" why would you wanna ruin excellent pizza with ranch? Lol. Btw don't go to Grimaldies down the road cause they don't have ranch either. Maybe Pizza Hut? So funny. I like ranch too but def not needed for Grazie or Grimaldies pizza pies!! Maybe just bring a packet in your purse... Oops I kinda got off topic. To sum it up: great food, wine selection, and last time I went there was an intoxicating server. She had a great accent...

As a local from Hawaii, this is place is pretty good. I tried: 

Kalua pork and cabbage
Hamburger steak
Korean chicken

The korean chicken was fantastic. Just alittle but of crunch on the skin of the chicken and just the right amount of spice. 

I've had better Hamburger steak, but it'll have to do. I wish there were more vegetables on the plate

I've had waaaay better kalua pork. There isn't much flavor to it. 

The mac salad on all the plates was just like home in Hawaii. Just a dash of pepper and it was like being home. 

I really disliked the cash only deal. You're in a casino, people.

Highly disappointed in this place.  First of all the line is long, the pick up register was empty and could have been used to make the line move quicker. We were not told that the sauces were at a station. When we got our meals my mac and cheese was cold and the pulled chicken sandwich was dry.  To top it off, all of the buns on our sandwiches were soggy and fell apart.  Overall save your money, there are better bbq places than this one.

First of all we wanted to try this place for the first time and we just purchased a groupon so we decided to go. We were excited at first the bread and salad were good but the meals were ok nothing spectacular for the price. Our major disappointment came when we were ready to pay, the server was less than pleasant when we handed her the groupon, then when she brought back our revised bill she marked a 20 percent gratuity on it! Really?!?!?! A tip is based on your service and not on what you think you deserve. Her service was ok at best and being in the restaurant industry we were going to tip her on the entire amount but since she wrote it in the credit card tip line we decided not to tip her on the entire bill! Needless to say we will NOT be returning! I will be sure to spread the word!

I decided to try this place and it was the worst experience EVER!  I made an appointment for Saturday 2:30, I was called 40 minutes before my appointment to reschedule for 3:30, I agreed, when I arrived, the receptionist was playing receptionist and doing a pedicure...ok. Well when 3:45 approached I had to question why I was waiting, there was no one in the place. So when I got in the chair (now 4pm) the woman, elderly, acted like she was new to the place, didn't know where stuff was, couldn't operate her blow dryer etc. So when I was getting my hair washed the hair bowl kept moving like it was broken. I also asked if I could get a eyebrow wax since I was one of the two in the salon, she said yes and proceeded to pull out sissors, really? Long story short, I came home highly disappointed in my services and experience.  A month later and my hair is faded and my eyebrow is still growing back.  HORRIBLE SALON!

The Parma location needs help, BADLY!

The menu at the Parma location has been reduced to a badly typed 3/4 page menu, from a FULL MENU!  Of course, the full menu is still on the website,misleading people.  They were out of fries, out of mushrooms, and out of wings!  The Parma location has repeatedly had the worst service of any restaurant in town!  Tonight, service was terrible, even though the place was empty. Our beers sat at the bar for about 8 minutes, until I got up, walked over and got them. Ten minutes later, when the waitress returned, she said "oh, you got your beers?" I bit my tongue. Last time I'll be going here. This place has went downhill fast.

Absolutely.. Terrible. Just got my cut done so I can go turn in job apps tomorrow. Should have went to a barber! Got in quick, very friendly staff. But the dude who cut my hair (Mike) was horrific. So slow.. Cut it all around than went back to finish cause it was uneven, and it is STILL uneven which drives me crazy. I asked for a one and a half and it's the longest one and a half I've ever seen, more like a two. I asked to taper down the back and he just lined it up, and did not line up around my ears. I have to go spend more money tomorrow morning before I head out to get this re done and I have to get it a shorter size now. So angry. Don't go here for your own good.

Come here for all your smoke goods.. NOT YOUR VAPING GOODS!!! First juice I've ever had that literally gave me a headache, waste of money. Obviously they go for the best deal and not the quality juice, I don't think anyone actually tries the stuff before they buy it. Just terrible

Came in the night before I moved into my new spot in Vegas. Staff was very kind, room was clean and nice, and the free breakfast at their Denny's was a really good deal. $100 for a 2 bed, not bad.

My 5 stars are specifically for the quality of the food, the meal was phenomenal. Amazing flavor and a very large portion. A tad bit expensive but what can you expect from a great quality restaurant. Hands down one of the top 5 Mexican food spots I've ever had, I'll be back whenever I find myself on the west side of the strip.

Stopped by this place on my way home from the weekend swap meet, and I must say that I'm glad I did! Food tasted fantastic, didn't wait long to be seated and the food came pretty quickly. My 2 reasons for the 4 stars instead of 5... My beans looked like they had been sitting for quite a while, everything was hot but the beans (minor deal). Secondly and more importantly, my $8 Cadillac margarita was way to small. I've spent $6 at other places that were both stronger AND bigger. It was neither strong nor large. Great food though honestly, the steak was cooked perfectly. And the staff is very nice. Was to full for desert but their selection was incredible, easily 30-40 choices and they all looked amazing.

Went to Cheers in hopes of watching the Kings game because I'm from LA. Went inside and the guest bartender Tommy was cool enough to find it for me, they have 3 good sized tv screens surrounding the bar so multiple games can go on at once. I met some great UNLV students who gave me some great tips on the town and the drink prices were great ( $4.50 for each beer is cool by me... Beats $7 at a lot of places). They have pool tables all around and juke box constantly jammin great rock tunes. I'll be back tonight for another kings game! Definitely should check this spot out.

This place is GREAT! In LA, $100 a month to climb at Boulder Dash or virtually any indoor climbing gym. This place is $120 for 3 months! And $10 a month for a gear rentals. They have one big Boulder with all levels of climbing surrounding it. Most of it is inverted which was hard at first since I haven't climbed in about 6 months. But, after a day or two you get the technique to keep your body on the wall. They also have a few auto belays and tons of top rope routes surrounding the building. I saw a guy on a slack line doing some crazy acrobatics in the corner so I guess they let performers practice there to. I'm glad I became a member I go almost everyday now. Come on thru and climb sometime! Friendly people, friendly staff, great prices, and whoever picks the music station has the vibes on point.

This place is awesome! Just moved to Vegas on Sunday. I've had 3 separate occasions when I bought e-juice from a local smoke shop and they were TERRIBLE.. One actually gave me a headache ( never ever buy a juice from the company called 'Dolce Vapes'). Anyways, I went into Vapor Bombz and it was great. Edgar recommended some great liquids for me and my taste and the prices were very fair. They have a rewards program so after 9 bottles you get the 10th free! If you Vape like me, that adds up pretty quickly. I definitely recommended this shop it's amazing.

Was in Phoenix for a convention and looking for a place to have breakfast. I found Mate's on Yelp and gave it a shot.  It was fantastic!   Food was awesome, service great, and ambiance was just what I was looking for.  If anyone is downtown phoenix and looking for a great breakfast go to Matts.

Cheap and cheerful.  Been here a few times and service and food quality is consistent. Nothing super special but its not terrible either.

I always get the masala dosa - pretty traditional and standard. Could use more filling because I find myself eating a lot of the wrap at the end and just dipping it into the sauce. 

Had the pani puri - pretty good, but not really the best deal for the price - I expect a few more. 

Chaat papri was good as well - but again - could have been more generous with the portion size. 

Service here is quick - I was seated promptly and the wait staff are attentive, so ordering was quick and easy.

Came here a few weeks ago with some friends for lunch. They were running "Jaipurlicous" so we had that. 

I had the tandoori chicken wings as my app - didn't enjoy it all too much - it wasn't the traditional red, BBQ charred colour or taste I expected. Instead it was yellowish and looked to be semi broiled. Wasn't a fan. 

My main dish of shrimp masala was good - really enjoyed the gravy - perfect level of spice and it was really aromatic. The naan was nice and fluffy. 

For dessert I had the gulab jamun. The meal came with one, I could have easily had another 2 - these were rich, sweet and warm (I like them served warm, not cold like some restaurants do). 

Price was great and service was good as well. Will come again and try other dishes, and I know not to order their tandoori wings.

Came on a recommendation from a friend. We had the chilli chicken dry, the chilli shrimp dry, the Manchurian mix fried rice and the chicken pakoras. 

My favourite dish was the Manchurian Mixed Fried Rice - it was just the right level of spice - it's definitely got some kick to it so if you aren't a big spicy food eater you might want to ask them to tone it down. Portion size was huge! We had enough for lunch and dinner the next day. 

Underwhelming was the chicken pakoras - they were not that great compared to others we have had from at other Hakka places. They were also quite pricy for what you were getting. They also came last which was a bit odd since usually they come as appetizers. We were halfway through our meal when they arrived and only had one each since our plates were full. 

I know people rave about the prices at this place but it was only reasonable - not a super great deal. Our go to Hakka place is about 20 dollars cheaper and it's good food too! 

I would still come again though

First time trying Paramount Fine Foods - heard both positive and negative things about their other locations and had to try this for myself. 

This is their newest location. They had been open a few weeks when I visited with a large group of friends. The good news is they were able to accommodate the large party on short notice. The staff were polite, but because it was so busy they were not as attentive as I would have liked. We had to make several requests for garnishes, drinks and cutlery. 

The nightmare came when it came time to order. You had to navigate yourself through the crowds of people to the other side of the restaurant to place your order. They had so many staff around I don't understand why they don't have table service. The nightmare continued when the food took over 45 minutes for everyone to receive their food. Some orders came within 15 minutes, others took up to 45 minutes. By the time the last people received their food the first group of people already finish their dinners. 

I was one of the first ones to receive their dinner but it was cold. The beef was very tough - couldn't stab it with a fork and had to use my hands. The rice was quite bland and the salad wilted. I also tried the butter chicken pizza which was ok. Mixed reviews from the other people we were dining with as well - the grilled chicken was good as was the other barbecued items. some of the other pizzas that they had tried we're also just okay. One of the only highlights was the pita bread that was brought to our table when we arrived - it was piping hot. 

Maybe it's just growing pains. I will give another location a second chance.

Would have been perfect if full menu was available and heat was working properly. 

Came with a group of friends for winterlicous. Their heating wasn't working so we had to step over their space heaters to get to our table. It was pretty full considering it was a weekday evening. 

Server was very nice - she was attentive and patient. They had run out of a few things on their menu because she said they were very busy from the weekend so we had to make second choices.  They ran out of 2 appetizers, 1 main and 1 dessert so she had to stand there as we all re-read the menu to choose other things.

I had the shrimp app. Very good - big pieces. Salad could have used a bit more dressing. Butter chicken main was amazing. Tender chicken - I can't remember the last time I had such tender chicken at an Indian restaurant. The sauce was delicious - cleaned my plate with naan, which was freshly baked and soft. Rice pudding for dessert with gulab jamun. They put the gulab jamun into the rice pudding. I didn't like that, should have put it on the side.

My friends had the lamb, beef and mutton. All were raving about their food too. Did not disappoint!

Coming back here again next time so I can have my first choice - lobster and shrimp!

I used to frequent Congee Queen at least 3 times a month when I worked close by. I hadn't had the food there for over a year and decided to take my family here since I was selfishly craving it myself. 

Portion sizes are great for sharing with a large family. We a family size seafood soup. Should have gone with the smaller size because we ended up taking half of it home. It was really good! For our dinner we ordered a ton of dishes. Lobster, done the traditional way with green onion, Mango chicken and shrimp dish - unique flavour combo - we enjoyed it. Seafood chow mein, general Tao chicken, fried chilli turnip patties, spice and pepper salt squid, snow peas with garlic sauce -  everything was amazing. We had lots to take home for lunch the next day. 

One star lost only because they had forgotten one dish and they had to make it after all the others had arrived. When it did arrive it was good anyhow, but would have been nice if if arrived with everything else.

Came here for a big birthday dinner and we were not disappointed. After reading the reviews we were prepared - they did try to up sell out lobster and king crab. We were specific in what size we wanted and for the most part they complied (only paid about 5 bucks extra for the bigger crab).  They come out with the live lobster and crab to show you and to take photos of your upcoming meal. Quite entertaining watching people take selfies with their lobsters. 

Food was amazing! I love seafood and this really hit the spot. The presentation was really nice. Enjoyed every aspect of the meal.  The fried crab was really good - best part of the meal for sure! We also ordered a few extra dishes to complement all the seafood. We ordered a whole chicken which was good - on the smaller side considering you can go across the street to the supermarket to get a similar one for half the price. The mushroom efu noodle was meh - soggy and sticky. This place definitely has their seafood skills down - wouldn't order their other dishes. 

We had extras so they packed it up and we had lunch for the next day. The service here was not characteristic of typical Chinese restaurants. We had great service with friendly staff coming by to wish my loved one a happy birthday (we had a cake and they volunteered to refrigerate it for us).

Except for a handful of items on their menu, the food tastes exactly like Bamiyan Kabob. 

Things that are different - less busy, smaller, parking lot is a big mess on a Friday/Saturday night. Arrive early or you're going to be parking across the street. This restaurant shares a parking lot with a few other establishments, hence why the lack of parking. 

We came with a group of 10 and were lucky that we got a table. A few other parties came in after and had wait for a spot to sit.

The food took 20 minutes to arrive, but it was good - slightly less in terms of portion size compared to bamiyan, but it was good. Their chicken breast and tikka chicken was good. I did not enjoy their beef kabob - bamiyan is that winner here. 

Good, friendly service - will come again!

There are way better places to get your fix of Chinese buns from.  There is zero customer service here.  The buns were sub par. I've had much better buns from the local Loblaws and No Frills that sell the prepackaged 3 variety selection. And it was expensive - BBQ pork bun was $1.10 - which would be okay if there was actually BBQ pork meat inside it! Just a dollop of red goop.  Quality of other buns were the same - no filling and undercooked dough. 

I was gifted a certificate from a wedding invitation so I had to spend it.  First off there's no address on the voucher so I had to call them. The woman who picked up the phone was so rude - like I was making her do some exhaustive task by simply asking what their address was. 

When I went, I picked what I wanted, brought the tray to get rung up and it came to $10 exactly - value of my voucher. I handed my voucher to her and she said "you have to pay $2 if you're going to use this."  They apparently give a 20% discount on cash purchases and this voucher doesn't count. Okay... So I give her $5. She gives me back $2. I look at my hand and said. "Didn't you say $2?" She said "yea, so I'm giving you change" I said "but you owe me $3". She gave me the dirtiest look and threw a loonie into my hand and gave me by bag.

I am not returning to this bakery.

This is not your typical dim sum place - this is high end.  Presentation is amazing, atmosphere is really nice, no plastic table clothes and paper napkins here.  But that star of the show - the dim sum - is average. The price is not average though - over $60 for two people and we weren't even full. The menu isn't that big, so we had to go elsewhere to eat afterwards. 

If you're trying to impress your Chinese mother in law, come here. Otherwise, there are better places for less and the food is much better.

Restaurant was busy for a weeknight and we figured that was a good sign. Checked Yelp and it appeared positive. 

Had the Manchurian noodle with shrimp, chicken pakoras and chilli chicken. Service was quick. Pakoras came out first... At least that's what we ordered. Not sure if I would call what the hard, round tennis balls, brown, almost black, mostly breading things, pakoras... But okay. Taste? Just like I expected. Not good. I thought maybe the just burned out batch. Nope. That's how they all looked when I looked around the room for other patrons who ordered "pakoras". 

Manchurian noodles were drenched in oil. A lot of oil. Slippery couldn't hold them on chopsticks oily. The dish as mostly noodles - no veggies and shrimp were tiny. Chilli chicken was also a greasy mess.  The only thing that they didn't mess up was the rice. Oh and the Coke that I ordered. 

The only "positive" thing was that portions were huge. Enough for us to take home for lunch and dinner the next day. Not that we wanted to eat it again.

Drove past this place for years and finally decided to give it a try after reading a review online. We took the reviewers suggestion of having the chilli chicken and crispy beef, in addition we ordered a manchurian chow mein. 

Chilli chicken was very good. Very good gravy to go with the steamed rice. The crispy beef was a bit disappointing - it was very sweet and tasted like a dessert rather than an entree.  Felt like asking for a side of whipped cream or ice cream to go with the beef. Manchurian chow mein with chicken was good - did not cheap out on the chicken like a lot of other hakka places do. 

Portions are large which was perfect for is - we had lunch for the next day.

Owners and servers were pleasant and attentive. The restaurant was quite busy the Sunday evening we went - a few large parties. Had we come a few minutes later we would have had to wait for a table. 

Will be back to try the other items on the menu. Yum!

Where can you find $2.00 a dish dim sum anymore? The quality is good for the price you're paying. I went to a dim sum place and paid 3 times that price for a mediocre meal. This isn't a gourmet place like the ones in Markham and Richmond Hill but its perfect for the downtown dwellers. 

The ladies pushing the carts are nice - the wait staff are super busy so sometimes you have to remind them of your requests. 

If the dim sum dish you are craving has not come around after a few carts have passed,  you can order the dish through the wait staff who will put the order into the kitchen - nice and fresh!

Stars taken away for ambiance and decor - need a major update. Food presentation can be improved as well, but all in all, it's $2 a dish! Take some to go for a nice easy dinner!

Random comment - Elevator is a bit sketchy - if you're not afraid of heights, take the stairs - the elevator takes a while to get there and you'd want to let the elderly on first anyhow, leaving you to wait for it to come back again.

I've been here a few times and have been disappointed the last handful of visits.

Most recent visit, my group and I waited for an hour before the first meal was delivered. From there it took another 20 minutes before we all got our food. 

I ordered the peppercorn steak. I ordered it medium well, they gave it to me well done. It was chewy, hard and not flavourful at all.  The vegetable side was a big gloppy mess of green and red peppers - the "sauce" they cooked it in tasted like a glue of corn starch and water. There were three small half pieces of roasted potatoes. For 22 bucks I expect a lot more. 

Our waitress was nice - felt bad for her because it's not her fault that the kitchen is so slow, but she had to hear about it from the customers in the dining room.

3.5 stars - lost .5 star for lack authentically tasting Thai food, but still good!!

Salad king - also known as the "Ryerson cafeteria". Best deal around for Thai food. Good meal under $10. 

There are more authentic restaurants around but part of the reason why we come here is simply to hang out with a group of friends and it's a central location for everyone to come to. We're not fans of the "other Thai restaurant" down the street. 

My go to dishes: spring rolls to start at every meal, then I either get the classic pad Thai, Thai Islamic noodles, Pattaya chicken or the red curry. I've had pretty much everything on the menu over the years, but those are my faves. 

I have had friend brave enough to do 20 chilli in their curry. It did not go well - upset stomach for a few hours after. Just stick to 10 and under. Don't be a hero. Lol!

My coworkers and I used to frequent Ho Su often until a few of us didn't feel so great after eating there one day. We gave it another shot and the same thing happened. We all had the same thing - bento boxes - some of us had beef teriyaki, some chicken teriyaki. We figured it was something common in the boxes. Likely the glass noodles because both times they tasted off - strange after taste. Crossed this off our list and we now go down the street to another sushi establishment - a bit more in price but at least we feel good after eating there!

I've been here a quite a few times over the last two or three years and something has definitely changed. The quality of the food has gone down hill and the prices are ridiculous! 

Today I went with my husband for lunch and we were disappointed! The food was cold and on four occasions after we ordered the dim sum, the woman said "okay let me warm it up for you" and proceeded to the back to microwave it! What the heck?! Why are they pushing around cold dishes?

When we asked for shrimp rice rolls, the waiter put in the order to the kitchen - we thought "great! at least it will be fresh". Well... when they came out we wanted to send it back. The roll was gummy and falling apart. Not pleasant at all. 

$40 for seven dishes, four of them microwaved, one of them barely edible - just not a good meal. Should have gone to Manchu Wok.

Came here for a lovely dinner with husband  been a few weeks ago and it was a great dining experience. 

We enjoyed the dim sum that we ordered. Obviously it is more expensive than the typical Chinatown restaurant however this was justified. Unique dishes, amazing flavours, reminded me of my experience dining in high end dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong a few years ago. 

Highly recommend the shrimp rice rolls. Had we not ordered so many dishes we definitely would have ordered a second helping of this amazing dish. We also ordered the green beans, ha gow, the special of the day - a wonderful honey shrimp dish, and vermicelli. 

Only disappointment was the desert that we had which was a chocolate steamed cake. The cake part was not that sweet a bit on the bland side. 

All in all it was a very nice experience and we will visit again.

If you're looking for a shawarma in this area, this is your only option. Better tasting options are downtown or in Scarborough. 

Had the traditional chicken shawarma. one of my favourite toppings are the pink pickled radishes. For some reason the ones here were not looking very appetizing. They were old and grey looking. I decided to opt out of those just to be on the safe side. Disappointed that they don't make their own hot sauce like many of the small mom and pop shops - this one was commercial. 

Price was good and the sandwich size reflected the price you were paying.

This place gets a bit of traffic from being in close proximity to the subway - hungry passengers picking up something a quick lunch or dinner.  Convenient place if you live/work in the area.

In an earlier review of another dim sum restaurant in the Spadina, I said "where can you find $2.00 a dish dim sum anymore"?

Well it appears we have discovered another one! And this time - it's better than the other restaurant I reviewed before!

Quality and quantity is better here. Fried shrimp dumplings - at the other place you get 3 small ones. Here? 4 large ones. Ha gow? Better here. There's also more selection it seems. 

It's less busy as the other place, but we also arrived a bit later than our normal dim sum time. The place marginally more decorative - with the seat covers and fancy table cloth, but both were stained with old sauces and food. 

Will visit again. Hopefully the linens are cleaner.

Overpriced and really disorganized - and it wasn't even busy. 

Came here for Sunday lunch "all you can eat" and I was hoping it would be better. We ordered our first round of food and it took 20 minutes for the first dishes to arrive. It can't possibly take a them 20 minutes to boil edamame!

Ordered 2 subsequent rounds of food and they took so long, we actually just cancelled our last round of food.  Apparently our last order was missed and the manager said it would be 15 minutes if we wanted to wait. No time - had to catch a movie at Fairview. 

Food is mediocre - nothing to rave about. Not shockingly, the portions were really small, so if you're coming with more than a party of 2 and everyone wants to try the dish, double up.

Came here for dinner with a group of 10 - we all did the all you can eat dinner option. Our server was very nice - took our drink and food order promptly. Problem was the amount of time we had to wait before food actually arrived. It took about 20 minutes before we saw the first dishes. Then each time we ordered again, it took half hour for the food to arrive. 

Food was okay. Nothing to write home about. This chefs special sizzling dishes were probably the better items on the menu. Sushi was okay as well. I personally am not a fan of their pad Thai so I would not order that. I did enjoy the mango and coconut ice cream that they served at the end. Disappointed that they don't offer red bean ice cream! :(

I really like the decor at this location and it is a great place to catch up with friends.

The fish and chips here is really good. You can tell by the packed parking lot and long line to get in for dinner. 

We came here on a Saturday night at around 7 and they were sold out of halibut!! They had just run out so the server had to come and ask us for a new order. So disappointed! I love halibut! We ended up getting haddock and basa instead.  The fish was fresh and flaky and battered perfectly. Chips are great too and coleslaw was yummy. 

Need to come back for the halibut!

I used to get my passport and visa photos from Shoppers. Ever since Blacks shut down they felt that they could bring their prices up. Just a couple of months ago I got my passport photo for $13 and now they upped it to $25. I needed 4 copies of the photo for a visa and they said it would be $50 at Shoppers. 

Quick check on Yelp brought me here. 

2 other customers were there before we arrived.  They were done in no time. 

When it came time to our photos, he was nice enough to touch up our faces - I personally was having a bad acne breakout so he cleaned it up.  In and out in 15 minutes.  $15 for 4 copies. 

Happy customers! I will be recommending this place.

It was quite busy for a mid week evening. I was shocked actually - all the tables were full, and there were people waiting for seats.  Only one server was working and the chef was by herself cooking everything for the restaurant, so it was quite chaotic. We forgave them when the server brought over something we did not order. It was similar enough so we kept it (shrimp tempura vs veggie tempura).  After the rush, the service did improve. You can tell they were stressed back in the kitchen. 

I came here with a large group and we decided to share about 10 dishes among all of us. Really liked the bibimbap! The complementary side dishes was nothing special. But what did stand out was the green pancake/crepe they sent over. So good we ended up ordering another!  

Prices are very reasonable and include tax.

Took my family here for vaccines and medication for an upcoming trip.  We made an appointment. Well apparently that didn't matter because we ended up waiting 2 hours just to see the doctor. Then we had to wait another half hour for the vaccines. 

The doctor was nice when we finally saw him. Gave us good information for our trip. Good news is we didn't get sick on the trip! 

We had another trip planned recently and decided to come back for a prescription for some more medication.  Again we made an appointment, perhaps it was an anomaly last time for having to wait so long. Nope. It was 2 hours again. 

It took them about 20 minutes to find my husbands file alone. Apparently it was misfiled.  

And this time what really frustrated me was that some people just walked in with no appointment and were seen first. My guess is because they were paying for their consultation were as we were just going for a prescription. 

Completely frustrating experience - next time I may try another clinic because this one clearly is understaffed and disorganized.

Been here a handful of times since they've opened.  It was busy 4 of the 5 times we went (Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening visits). If you have a group, make reservations because otherwise you'll be packed into a corner sharing a table with 2 or 3 people. 

Waffles and crepes were really good. I had a waffle topped with fruit and a scoop of their vanilla ice cream (which I heard was made in house, not commercial brand). Very good! My friend has the crepe with chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce - also very good!

Another occasion we had the hot chocolate with a slice of chocolate cake. Hot chocolate was really good. The cake slice was huge. I feel that they could reduce the price (which was pricy as is!) and serve a smaller portion. This is definitely a "share" sized piece of cake - but you're stuck with just one variety if you're with a date. Table beside us had a group of 3 who ordered 3 slices and left about half of their cake behind. 

They sometimes have entertainment - Bollywood dancers, band, themed parties, which is a nice change from the normal dessert places.

Waitress we had was rudeeeeeeeee! She was rude when we got in, rude when we ordered, rude when she brought our food, rude when we told her she forgot one of our sides and rude when we asked for the bill.

I went with a small group.  Food was just okay. It's pretty hard to screw up breakfast, but it happened. One person in my group ordered a sandwich. Disappointed - thoroughly. Bits of small chicken pieces which fell out every time they a bite of the sandwich.  Barely toasted bread, which was also soggy from the chicken that was probably sitting in the sandwich and waiting for the slow waitress to pick it up. Pancakes were forgotten by the waitress. When they came they were not hot, not surprisingly.  Home fries were soggy. 

Won't be coming back again.

2.5 stars

Half star earned only because I had really good service from the waiter and the greeter. They were attentive. 

Food - not good. I had the calamari dinner. Calamari was greasy and I got a number of pieces were the batter was removed from the calamari - not sure if it was on purpose to save on calamari or because the breading stick. 

Rice - small portion. Salad - wilted mess. Potatoes - one quarter piece. Not sure where the rest of them went. 

I couldn't finish my meal. I was disappointed that I paid $20.00+tax for that!

Messini on the Danforth is one of my favourite Greek restaurant on the strip.  

This location is a bit different - very much like a fast food joint in a food court. 

The food is good - same as the Danforth location, much smaller menu, but that's to be expected with such small space (only about 12 tables, 2-4 seaters each) 

But here's where they lost all the stars. The cashier and order taker at the front is complete rude. We had no clue what her problem is, but she was giving everyone attitude. Customers, the chefs, the woman who was clearing and cleaning tables. It was so disturbing I didn't even want to stay because every time we looked that way, she was giving someone a disinterested look,  rolling her eyes and smacking change into people's hands. Not acceptable!

So happy to have The Works in the neighbourhood! 

Navigating the menu is a bit daunting - the amount of options is overwhelming. The combinations are very unique and the combos that you kind of say "really?!" actually work.  Lots of choices for meat options too.  The prices are a bit high - but I tend to share my burger anyways because it's quite large. 

The staff here are amazing. Friendly, great with recommendations and you can tell they like being at work. I brought my 10 year old niece here for dinner one night and the waiter burst into song for her - really sweet gesture to put a smile on all of our faces.

Points for view. View of the lake, beautiful in the summer months. Great after lunch walk to work off that food you just ate. 

Prices are quite expensive and it's not really worth the price. Eggplant in that yummy sauce contained pork. Pork? Isn't it supposed to be fish? I prefer the fish version. 

Ha gow wrap is sticky and mushy. Stuck to my chopsticks and made for an embarrassing moment when the ha gow was stuck to my bowl and I couldn't dig it out. It fell apart and I had to chisel it off the bowl. Ugh. 

Service is a bit slow - they have plenty of staff - when my request for hot sauce didn't come after a few of our dishes did, I had to remind the server. Few minutes past and still nothing. Asked the waitress and she got it for me - finally!

Parking is expensive down there. Might want to leave the car at home and just walk or take the transit if you're in the downtown. area.

H&F Jewellery is amazing!

I had given my husband some ideas of engagement ring designs I liked and after going to the traditional big box jewelry stores, a friend of ours recommended H&F.

The customer service here is great - they are extremely knowledgeable, attentive, honest and the prices are very reasonable! My husband surprised me with a custom designed engagement ring and I love it!

We went back for our wedding bands and I worked with the gemologist there to create 4 beautiful bridesmaid gifts - necklaces with a pearl and white gold heart pendant - my girls loved them!

We've recommended 5 other friends to H&F - they've all been satisfied with their engagement rings and wedding bands.

Go to H&F for all your jewellery needs - you won't be disappointed!!

I've been here many times over the years and the quality of food has gone down hill. 

My most recent experience:  Had a get together with a few of my friends a while back - we came here because it was close to home. 

I had a pasta dish - I'm not sure how an Italian restaurant can mess up the most basic thing: cooking the pasta so that it is no longer raw. Well it happened. I couldn't finish my dish and was quite upset given this is not the first time where I had a disappointing meal here.

My friends had pizza - nothing special. Like someone had mentioned in another review - for the price you pay you you expect to be impressed. 

Needless to say I've given enough chances - won't be coming back here again!

Discovered this sushi place in our neighbourhood. Nice to have a local place we can walk to!

Atmosphere - small, Japanese decor (would make sense!) friendly staff and chefs. 

Food - really liked the rice that came with our bento boxes - not the typical white rice, presentation was lovely. Tempura appetizer was nicely battered and it came with egg plant tempura (i love egg plant!) Food was prepared fresh and tasted yummy!

Price - reasonable - not amazing deal like the restaurants on the Danforth, but you get what you pay for.

Joey's is me and my best friends favourite restaurant to come to for get togethers. 

Our favourites are the sushi cones as an app, lobster grilled cheese and lobster ravioli. Last week when we went though, we were really disappointed! They removed the lobster ravioli off the menu! The new pasta they had in its place, prawn florentine ravioli was not that great. Bring back the lobster ravioli!

Service at this location is always great - if you have to wait for dinner service, they bring out appetizers for you to snack on while you wait.

Good place for hakka food. It's family style so it's perfect for sharing with a bunch of friends. I really like the chilli chicken here. Manchurian noodles were great too!

Pretty busy on a Saturday night if you're coming during the prime dinner hour. Come a bit before to ensure they seat your large party.

I also went to Louis Shoe Repair for my Ugg boots. After attempting to do it myself with the "official" Ugg cleaning kit, the solution that came in the box to shampoo the boot actually made it worse -  turning the front of the boot hard, stained with a strange "sugary" looking texture. Do not buy this product!!

I didn't want to do more damage so I took it into Louis after reading the review below by Monica. 

He did an amazing job! I am so happy - the boots look brand new - soft and furry. It took a week to get them back and it came to $40 with the taxes (same price as the Ugg cleaner, way better results). I am going to bring my other pair in to get them cleaned at the end of the season. 

Highly recommend!

Food was okay - as others have pointed out, a bit expensive. Everything is fried fresh, right when you order. Nothing is frozen (better not be for the price you're paying).  We had the calamari and two orders of halibut with fries. It took a very long time for food to arrive, as it was quite busy on a Saturday evening.

Big points lost for service - Also as others have mentioned, the staff here aren't exactly welcoming and warm.  I wasn't pleased at how they were treating their customers. I'm not expecting a joint like this to roll out the red carpet, but I do expect a bit of kindness.

I wish they had a zero star rating option here. Because this is what I would give this BMW location. 

I bought my car at a different location a few years ago and this dealership was the closest one to my house. I had a mechanical issue with my car and brought it in for service on a Monday morning. They didn't touch my car that day so when I came back it wasn't fixed. They told me to drive it home and bring it back the next day. This happened three times that week. I thought they had fixed it by the third time as they said they did but this was not true.  I had to bring about the following week another two additional times. What a nightmare!

Service staff here are incredibly rude, unprofessional and they really don't care about customer service whatsoever.  The only person that was actually nice was the receptionist. 

I thought perhaps this was isolated to the service department but it turns out that this is not the case. I came back for a part a few months later and the parts counter staff were just as rude and confrontational. I simply wanted to purchase a part! I didn't need the attitude.

I have decided that my next car won't be a BMW - I'm going with another luxury car retailer. What a terrible experience!

My go to place for a Hawaiian pizza on a Saturday night. Wings are really great as well! They have a "butter chicken pizza" that is definitely worth a try! Way better than the grocery store frozen version!

Very friendly service - always a pleasant conversation when I pick up my order. 

They moved locations - formally at Dundas and Bathurst, now at Bloor and Crawford. Just a few minutes north west!

Really good Indian/Pakistani food.  I've been coming here for at least 10 years and it's come a long way in terms of expanding the sizes. Still the same furniture though - by that I mean the plastic patio chairs and tables. But you don't come here for the luxurious surroundings. 

Food is good - beef kabobs, chicken kabobs,  paneer, butter chicken, biryani - I've had it all. All authentic, so be prepared for a meal filled with butter, oils and deep fried fair.  Naan is really good - fresh and soft. 

The price of the food is quite high compared to other Indian restaurants. But it's not outrageous like others I've been to.  

For an on the go experience, grab a wrap - beef is my fave. ask for extra lettuce and onions because otherwise you're getting 2 pieces of lettuce and one piece of onion on a naan with the meat.

We've been to Crave ever since it's opened. I've tried a handful of dishes there and for the most part, I've enjoyed my meals. I've also had pretty good service here as well. 

First time we came here, we were with a larger group, they had just opened a couple of weeks before and the manager came out to get our opinion. Nice guy who genuinely wanted to get our feedback. 

My previous visit, my husband ordered the lamb chops. They were all bone and my husband was really disappointed - it's not a cheap meal after all! So he bought it up to the waitress and she offered him a new meal.

Most recently, I had the New York strip and my husband had the filet minion. My steak was over done and was tough to eat. Gravy for my potatoes did not taste proper either. My husband shared half his portion with me - his meal was cooked perfectly.  My friends who ordered steaks and pastas were pleased with their meals, so I was the odd one out. 

Dessert was good - had the molten chocolate cake with ice cream - delish! 

The waitress was nice - very cheery, quick with our requests.

Love this bakery! Best Chinese bakery of the 3 in the area. 

Their Vietnamese chicken sandwiches are really good as is the "Special" which is an assortment of the different meats. The vegetarian tofu one is also very good. 

As another poster has mentioned, the egg tarts are amazing. They're flaky and wonderfully eggy. Since they turn over so quickly they're often warm - which is the best way to have them. 

The birthday cakes and rolled cakes are good too. My favourite is the fruit cake - not the "Christmas cake", but a great sponge cake with fruit in the cream layer in between.

Love this sushi place! I work close by and my group of coworkers would come here often. Make resos if you're coming for lunch on Fridays. The kitchen is really small so it does take a while for food to come out of you're with a large group.

I always get the Lola bento box - you get a choice of main dish (chicken, salmon, beef, various sushi, etc) with your Japanese bento box staples (few rolls, salad, rice, miso, tempura, fruit). Dynamite roll is really good too - pretty big serving - enough for a nice lunch!

Really good kebabs! Doesn't matter what you order - beef, chicken, lamb, and whatever marinade - I haven't had a bad selection yet! Price is fair for the amount of food you get. I often take home some for lunch next day. 

Two downsides - not enough seating during peak dinner time (doesn't matter what day you are going, it's busy all nights) and the lines are long.

Appetizer was good - had the deep fried shrimp rolls.

For our mains we had the garlic shrimp and Pad Thai. Neither was impressive. We were especially disappointed with the garlic shrimp - for the price we paid ($10) we expected a much larger portion than the 6-8 pieces we got and a bit more substance than just shrimp and a few pieces of roasted garlic.  We just added it to the pad Thai.

Pad Thai - good thing we ordered something to add to the pad Thai because there wasn't much to it besides noodles.  I think I would have enjoyed standing in line for Thai Express at the local mall food court - that's got better flavour than our meal today.

Best Thai food ever!

I've had almost everything on the menu (it's quite small) and everything is delicious! My favourite dish is the Sukho Pad Thai. The fragrances, the taste, makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Get the garlic chicken as an appetizer - garlicky goodness!

I took away one star because it is absolutely impossible to get seats in a decent time on Friday or Saturday night (we waited almost 2 hours one time and theres nothing in the area to go to so you're standing outside the restaurant) Long wait for food too when you get seated. And even if you call to order food for pick up, it takes an hour before you can come pick it up.

Got a mani and pedi here for my wedding. It was a really nice experience. The ladies here were super nice and when they found out I was getting married they were so excited to be doing my nails for the big day - and for the honeymoon on the beach. 

I had my finger nails painted the traditional French manicure - I got the shellac done for the first time. I loved it! It lasted for my entire 2 week honeymoon and looked great!

I wanted to go with a hot pink for the toes just for fun - but the lady suggested something more "bridal" lol! So she did them in silver with sparkles. Very cute. I am glad I took her advice. 

The whole experience took 2 hours they gave me a hand and foot massage as well. I felt nice and relaxed when I left.  Great service!!

We were expecting amazing Thai food after all the reviews that we read and the fact that this place was voted one of the top 100 restaurants in Toronto. 

This was disappointing. 

First off, it was really awkward sitting on the benches outside on the sidewalk, as people walked past us while to wait for our table. 

Second, when we were seated, it was so loud. It felt like we were in a high school cafeteria. There was so much noise from people talking over each other and from the loud music. We were just happy that we didn't have to share a table with another couple. 

Finally - Food was mediocre. I was extremely disappointed with the curry egg noodle dish. It was awkward to eat and I felt sick about half way through because the curry was too rich. On the flip side - I had a taste of my company's dish and it wasn't that great either - he had the beef stir fry dish with rice. The meat was nice and tender, but it wasn't flavourful. 

Wasn't worth the hype, unfortunately.

I used to be a big fan of "the other pizza chain that specializes in pan pizza". When we found out that Dominos makes pan pizza we had to try and now we are hooked. It's less greasy and the cheese is much better. Dominos is now our favourite pizza chain!

And this location is our favourite place to go! The staff here are energetic, friendly and they really aim to please. I come here often now and they know me by name and we have a good conversation while I wait for my order. They know precisely how we like our pizza (not well done, but almost...). 

We live outside the delivery area and we rather drive and pick up our pizza than to get delivery from the other location closer to our house.

Attentive service and good food! Had the Mexican corn and tortilla with 3 dips for apps.  Guacamole was good - other two dips - the corn salsa and spicy bean and smoked queso was meh. Mexican corn was really good. The sauce and spices were yummy!

I had the cod tacos and the Crispy Cotija. Cod taco was good. Cotija not so much.  

I was too stuffed to eat a whole dessert myself so I shared the churros. I didn't enjoy these at all. I much have rather had one of the Sweet Jesus popsicles that my other dinner guests had. 

Overall it was good. Next time I'll know to get less tacos or apps and save room for dessert.

Really good place introduced by my coworkers. It's quite the drive from the office but it's worth the trip for lunch. 

I've been during lunch, they have special combos for a good price - and lots of options.  Dinner is reasonably priced, not as great as lunch pricing. 

Love the chicken pakoras, manchurian chow mein, Szechwan fried rice, and chilli chicken. 

Great place for large gatherings as it is family style - order a ton and sample everything.

My cousin recommended that I try this place - she showed me pics of her dinner and it looked amazing!

Came here for a special anniversary dinner. The restaurant is very small and in an obscure location in the middle of Scarborough - not where you would expect to find a good seafood restaurant!

We came on a weeknight and had no problem getting seats. I did hear that it was harder on Fridays and Saturday nights so either call for a table. 

Food was good - nice and fresh, no surprise since the market was right on site! A bit pricy compared to other seafood restaurants but it was good quality and knowing that the seafood wasn't sitting around in some fridge for a long time was worth it. We had scallops, shrimps, salmon and calamari. Yum!

I really wanted to like this place.  I really did. 

2 Uber orders, one customer in front of me and 6 more behind me. Two tables were waiting for their food. They came up twice to see what the hold up was.  It took close to 40 mins for my take out order of two sandwiches and a poutine. Uber driver got so fed up he left and told them that he's cancelling the order. 

Sandwiches were good. The poutine was super salty.

Quick search on Yelp for good Hakka Food yielded this restaurant. Other reviewers are right - this place is in a really sketchy neighbourhood but the food is good!

We went many of the suggested dishes on Yelp - - started with the Chicken Pakoras. Okay. These were amazing. Not a ton of breading - just right. And the flavours were soooo yum! I could eat this all by themselves all day! I've had many versions of Chicken Pakoras and this is hands down the best one. We also went the Crispy Beef as everyone seems to suggest. It was good! Gingery, sesamey and nicely done with some onions. Wouldn't be Hakka dinner if we didn't try their Chilli Chicken with gravy which was also good! Could have been a touch spicier but it was good nonetheless.  We had the Hakka noodles which was also good. The shrimps were a bit small - but there was too much going on with other ingredients to miss them too much. 

Service was great - friendly service on the phone and the food was fresh. We'll be back to try other dishes soon!

Really good experience here. I dined with 20 people and they were attentive to each of our needs - waiter was really knowledgable and knew all the ingredients in each dish and was able to make really good suggestions for our group. 

Loved the slaw.  I have cravings for this dish all the time now. Best thing on the menu! I also had the lobster ravioli and had a bite of the black cod. Also very good!

Even though it was a busy night, at no time did we feel rushed by waitstaff.

Had lunch here a few weeks ago - I was quite disappointed in both the quality of the food and the service. 

It was a nice summer day so we went out to the patio which was nice.  We ordered drinks, which came promptly along with samples. And that was the end of the prompt service. We waited over 45 minutes for our food. I asked about half an hour in if the food was coming. The waiter said it would be about 5 minutes. 15 minutes later the food arrives.  We didn't order anything fancy or complex to warrant such a wait. The burger I ordered was mediocre and the fries that came as a side was so small questioned if this was a garnish. 

When we requested our bill that took another 15 minutes to arrive. 

Almost 3 hours later, we finally left - desperately trying to find a chocolate bar because that lunch was not satisfying at all.

I had to see what the fuss was about.  The line was just over an hour long on a sunny Saturday afternoon. I hung out with a friend so at least the time passed quickly. You can smell the goodness coming from the ovens from outside. 

One batch of cheesecakes yields 12 orders.  Probably about 35-40 mins to bake, but they gave a couple of ovens so the line moves every 20 mins or so. 

I got a cheesecake and an order of Madeleine's. Both were really good! The cheese cake was melt in your mouth soft and not too sweet as its American counterpart. My friend who does not like American cheesecake thoroughly enjoyed this variation. 

Would I stand in line again for over an hour for this? Not likely. But I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again if there wasn't a line.

Very good place for all things lobster! I had the lobster Mac and cheese and the lobster poutine. Very good!

The place is quite small and tends to get busy during prime dinner time. We knew this so we went early and had no problem getting seats. As the evening progressed the lines grew outside. 

Service was friendly and accommodating. We ordered a bunch of stuff for apps and we wanted to share. They're more than happy to bring extra cutlery and plates. 

Yum! I think I may need to go back soon to satisfy my lobster craving!

Chinese buffet with Chinese people eating there? This is definitely not the mandarin! 

Huge lines ups during Friday Saturday and Sundays. Less busy on weekdays, also cheaper. Try to go then so you can be seated at a decent time. 

The food is good - some authentic dishes with the traditional "Canadian" fare you would find at the food courts. 

I can't remember what day it was, but they had half lobsters for every guest.  It was a bit dry, not my favourite thing from the massive buffet selection. 

Fare included: dim sum (ha gow and siu Mai, different dumplings etc), noodle bar!, sushi (it was okay - not mind blowing), salad bar and they had tons of dessert - both the typical cake, jello and ice cream you see at the mandarin, but they had some pretty good Chinese desserts too (tofu dessert - served warm), almond jello, mango jello etc. 


Price is more than the mandarin, but it's definitely better quality and service.

We had our wedding this past fall at the Red Rose Convention Center.   Deepak was extremely amazing at his job - professional, well organized, detail oriented and he gave us great advice.  The in house decorators did a wonderful job matching my theme colors and it was beautifully set up.  The food was amazing! We had a mixed culture wedding and decided to have an Indian reception and my family, who aren't Indian, really enjoyed the food!  The dessert tables was beautifully set up - with a lovely ice sculpture, which was really impressive. The staff at Red Rose were helpful, pleasant and we couldn't be happier with our reception! Great job Deepak!!

Updated review (keeping 2 stars) after having one of the owners message me on here, same guy that was the cook when I went in. The customer service was horrible in my experience at this establishment. Our visit to a mom an pop restaurant should not be over an hour, that is not acceptable. Especially if there was less than 10 guests in the establishment. I wondered how all of the reviews were 5 stars, am I the only one he messages after a lower rating? Just a heads up yelpers! If you don't label this place 5 stars you can expect a message!

Wow, call on Roger! He is very easy to work with and very knowledgeable. He fixed my audio problem in less than fifteen minutes. He is amazing. My computer tech chose the wrong settings for my PC "Media Center". This prevented my PC from sending sound to my speakers. I was so frustrated trying to figure out who could help me. Then I read about Roger on Yelp. I read all of the positive reviews and decided to call him. I got lucky in the sense that he was able to come the same day. So here I am sharing very good comments in hope that one of you folks reading this will give him a try. I hope this review helps Roger and potential customers.

The need for honest, reliable and talented Android techs is high. When my phone gave me trouble or I wanted to root or update safely or whatever, I used to get that awful scary feeling!
Now that I use Todd, I never worry. He always knows what to do and he does it perfectly.
He has updated many of my gadgets including an old HP TouchPad that had a black screen. I only use it for watching the news while I prepare meals but I enjoy having it working again. He also saved my HTC One that was bricked.
Don't be afraid to fix or update your gadgets with them instead of buying new ones. You will save a lot of money and get most of the new features. However, they do have a lot of different phones at great prices that you can buy from them if you choose.
Todd just updated my Note 2 to Kit Kat. He did a fantastic job. Now I don't feel the urgency to buy a new Note or start another 2 year contract.
Todd and Mohammed are really nice fellows, really talented and very reasonable.
I highly recommend them!!

Hate to rain on the parade but our experience tonight at the Gilbert location was disappointing.  We have been to the Arcadia location many times and count it as one of our favorite eating destinations in Phoenix. However, a combination of problems added a sour note to an otherwise nice evening.  

The first problem -- apparently the kitchen lost track of our salad -- would have been understandable for a new operation.  Plus, to their credit, Postino did not charge for the salad.  However, our server compounded the problem by trying to close our bill while we were enjoying our meal culminating with her giving us our check before I had finished eating said salad.  Not only did we feel rushed out of the restaurant but we had intended to order dessert!

I have always admired the wait staff at the Arcadia location for their professionalism that seemed to support a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. The Gilbert location stumbled on both accounts.  We'll assume this new operation will resolve these bugs and hope to return to this location.  Afterall, the bruschetta is delicious, the wine list is extensive, and the yet-to-be-tried salty caramel sundae is too enticing to avoid.

Went on Sunday to get the whole package; a haircut and a Royal Shave.

I'll preface this by saying it was pretty pricey for the whole package, over $100. Mostly in part due to the shave. The experience however, made it all worth it. I don't normally keep a beard, but I had been growing one for the past few months and decided to shave. After the haircut, you get the shave, and it is a process, but it's very in depth, relaxing, and it gives you that feeling of living the good life. 

The haircut is really where I'm on the fence. Although a bad run in with a previous barber unfamiliar with my hair on a work trip left my crown pretty shoddy, my barber, Mignon did good work with what hair I had. Arguably the second best haircut I've ever had, and a picture of the best, she did a very good job. Give it one or two more visits and I'm sure she'll get it dialed in. 

I probably won't get the shave again to save some money, and because I normally stay clean shaven, but if there ever is a time I grow out my beard, I'd get the whole package again simply because it's such a relaxing experience.

I stopped in here for a haircut a little over a month ago. It had good reviews and was close to home, so I figured it was worth a shot.

This really isn't a barber shop, it's more of an electric clipper chop shop. I normally sport a gentlemans cut with a fade on the sides. The man that shaved my hair cut right across my crown with his clippers and completely ruined it; I didn't have enough hair to comb on it so it sticks straight out of the back of my head and requires an ungodly amount of product to get to lay down, and even then, it'll break free in a few hours.

Maybe it's just a one-off, bad luck scenario, but when it comes to your personal looks, you really can't accept any substitutes.

Quick response and came over within a day to give me an onsite quote! He even did the job the same day. I needed two carpets patched and one he said he would try a stain remover first to give me the best outcome, but it only worked on part so he came back a few days later when the carpet was dry and patched it. You can't even tell and it is in the middle of the room! Dane did a great job and I will recommend this company to others and absolutely use them again!

There are a lot of frozen yogurt places to check out, but Yogurtini is by far my favorite.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ The place is freaking adorable.  I know it sounds a little strange, but I love the colors they picked for the place.  The blues and greens MAKE me want to eat their yogurt.

-/+ The frozen yogurt.  Although I do love their vanilla flavor, it doesn't taste like "original" frozen yogurt.  They do make a homemade yogurt, and I haven't tried it, but I'm guessing that one must taste more like the classic frozen yogurt.

+ SO. MANY. TOPPINGS.  Hot sauce? Yes.  Gummy worms? Yes.  They have all the fruits you love, and definitely all the candy you love, to make your frozen yogurt just the way you want it.  (I personally like to mix my vanilla yogurt with peanut butter and chocolate chips).  

+ Punch cards.  This is a big thing for me.  Of course I'm gonna come back if a company is going to reward me for my loyalty.

Been to Steve's a few times.  Time for a review.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Good ambiance.  Low lighting and sweet music.  I really enjoy studying here.

+ Slightly above average coffee.  I've had better, but Steve's still has really good drinks.

+ Awesome prices.  I'm in college and I really like saving my money.

-/+ Customer service is alright.  One time I was there only one barista working.  He was obviously a high school student and had other important things going on.  Two of his friends came in and chatted him up at the counter... and they weren't quiet.  Then, he left the counter, with no one else there, to go outside for a smoke and talk with his little friends.  Nothing happened in result, but I thought it was rude.

Best coffee I have tasted, by far, in the short 20 years of my life.  Here's why (+ positive, -negative, -/+ neutral):

+ They're a hole-in-the-wall joint.  That means little to no traffic, cozy, fast.

+ Simple menu.  It really bugs me when coffee shops have a hundred-and-one different drinks up on the board.  Seattle Espresso's menu does not mess with your mind.

-/+ The baristas are average.  Most of the time I come in and they're friendly, but once I had a guy treat me like I wasn't even there.  His friend came in and they started talking... while he was making my drink and when I paid.

+++ I LOVE THEIR DRINKS.  Their espresso is smooth and blends well.  Their cup sizes are decent.  They have very unique flavors, my favorite being the white mocha.  The coffee experience here is sublime, to say the least.

Oh, Coffee Plantation, where didst thou self-respect go?  I've been coming here for a couple of years, and this is what I've decided (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral):

- Bad customer service.  There's one employee in particular who treats me like I'm a child every time I order... and she's never happy.

- Messy.  Maybe it's because the joint is on Mill (which is gross to begin with), but I'm guessing it's because the manager doesn't enforce cleanliness.

-/+ Coffee is decent, if not below average.  Don't try any fancy shmancy drinks here, you will be disappointed.

+ The food is amazing.  They cook their tofu just right: crispy, tasty, fresh.  I'm also a huge fan of the Greenburger.  I would have to say it's even better than an In-and-Out burger (although now I'm a vegetarian).

- The food is good, but definitely not healthy.  Grease, with a side of fat.

-/+ Seating could be better.  I don't feel relaxed here.

+ One word: Soynamis.  These are frozen yogurt (soy, of course) treats with mix-ins, like fruit, nuts, etc.  Perfection in a cup.

-/+ Service.  They get your order in quickly and get the food to you fast.  However, I always find myself a little bummed out after ordering, they never smile!

+ Limeade.  It's really, really good.

I'm an avid reader and ever since I visited City Lights Books in San Francisco, I was desperate to find a good independent bookstore in the East Valley.  Although Changing Hands is not quite City Lights, it comes in close second.  Here's why (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral):

+ They are organized.  Nothing Like Bookman's.

+ They have wonderful customer service.  I love everyone that works here.  They are always willing to help you find a book you'll enjoy.  Plus, they're knowledgeable, unlike B&N employees.

+ Book signings here are bomb.  I saw Stephanie Meyer shortly after she published Twilight.  It was legit.

+ PUNCH CARD!! Any bookstore that has a punch card is a friend in my book.  I actually have a full one right now that I need to utilize to get my 10% off!

-/+ I like Paradise Bakery, but I don't like them hitched to a bookstore.  It can be noisy sometimes.

Are there really words in the English language to describe how wonderful this food is?  Not even close.  This is by far the best Middle Eastern cuisine I've had in the valley.  Lots of entrees to choose from, so many different desserts, and if you're feeling bold, you can try one of their unique drink options. (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

-/+ Sometimes the wait can be long, especially during lunch hour.  But I wouldn't say that this should keep you away.  The food is worth it.

+ Chicken Shawarma

+ Gyros

+ Lots of food.  Sometimes you have to roll me out to the car when I'm done... and I STILL have left overs.

+ Friendly, helpful staff that will make you feel at home.

-/+  Decor.  I've heard some people hate on the "look" of the restaurant.  It's not a wine and dine kind of place and honestly, it's not that bad.  It's just a bunch of tables and chairs, but is that what you're there for?  No, you're there for the amazing, bountiful meal that your little tummy has been begging for.  It's clean, whether some people say that or not.  I'm pretty sure they wouldn't win Best-of awards for almost 30 years if they were bad at keeping things picked up.

+ Incense selection is awesome.  I love their stuff.

-/+ Location is terrible.  I don't like Mill Ave., but at least it's close to where I live.

- Poor customer service.  Don't talk to me like I'm stupid and we'll have a great employee/customer relationship.

- Expensive.  Tie-dye shirts for $25?  I'll make my own, thanks.  And I don't know many people that buy smoke supplies here (I don't smoke myself).

Solo is definitely one of my favorite places to get espresso now.  After checking out the great reviews on here, I decided to skip on my usuals (XB, Steve's)  and come here.  (No negatives or neutrals this time!)

+ Great location.  Strip mall, not too much traffic.  The storefront faces Baseline, so you can sit in comfort and watch cars go by.

+ The atmosphere is amazing!  I walked in and automatically felt at home.  There are couches, benches, tables, outside seating.  Everything you want in a coffee shop.  There's beautiful photography on the walls (which you can buy), including one of Jared Leto (or at least it looks just like him).  And there are plenty of places to plug in your laptop.

+ Local coffee!! I love it when local shops use homegrown stuff.  I had never had this kind of espresso, but all I can say is that it's damn good.  I can't remember the name, though.

+ The drinks.  Oh. My. Word.  I ordered a cafe mocha with no whip.  It was smooth, creamy, and had just the right amount of mocha.  It was to die for.  Also, if you're a big foam fan, you'll love any of their hot drinks.  I had about an inch of foam in my cup and it was thick and flavorful.

+ The service is just as great as the coffee.  The guy at the counter was polite, helped me choose a good drink, and smiled.  

I must say, it's going to be very difficult for me to find a place better than here.

Alright, so I'll be honest here, this was my first experience at a hookah bar, so I don't have much experience to go from.  On the other hand, I like to think I give pretty fair, intelligent reviews that are well-thought out.   I've been here twice so far.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Hookah is superb.  I will say their stuff is pretty good.  Smooth, not powerful, and flavorful.  

-/+ Customer service.  I think they're decent, but not amazing.  They're nice, friendly, and definitely help you out with any questions you may have.

- EXPENSIVE.  Holy mother of... why would I wanna pay $30 for hookah?  It just really blows my mind how much it costs.  It is good stuff... but really?

-/+ You must order a drink.  I kind of understand how this works on the business side of things, but I think maybe it cuts back on the amount of clientele.  And it's kind of annoying.  I go there for a smoke, not for a drink or coffee.  

+ Atmosphere.  Definitely what comes to mind for me when I hear "lounge."  Dark, spacious, comfortable, candles lit.  It's a nice place to relax for sure.  It's wonderfully decorated and you can tell the owners take pride in its appearance.

- Crappy, crappy food.  The hummus didn't even have garlic in it.  

- Not very relaxing.  It has an up-tight feel to it.  Decor seems a bit futuristic.

-/+ Espresso.  It was good, but it didn't make me say, "Mmmm!"

- Paying for internet.  You must purchase an order of $5 or more to get internet access.  Now, honestly, if you are an internet cafe within walking distance of ASU, you may as well keep the service free. 

+ Computers.  If you are in need of a computer for gaming, do come here.  I play WoW and if I didn't have a decent gaming comp, I would definitely use this place.  The backroom is dimly lit with TONS of computers and comfy chairs.  Definitely  MMORPG material.

Being that I live in the west valley now, there are little to no mom-n-pop delivery shops to choose from, Zella's is a friendly name that I remember. After ordering from them for over a year now, I think I have my final consensus. 

Overall, I don't know why I keep coming back to Zella's. I've had some pretty shitty phone service, but I guess I like their food enough to put up with it. PLEASE, if anything, Zella's, learn to be more courteous on the phone!

Please be aware that my review is based only on delivery. (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Good food. I love their boneless wings. Best flavor from any pizza/wing place in Arizona to date (for me). I usually get regular wings because no one likes wimpy wings aka boneless, but I love the Zella's boneless. They've hardly ever messed up my orders, although I'd say the boneless wings can come smaller than normal, and you never know what you'll get. I once got the usual 10, but each "wing" was about 1/2" in size. 

- Waiting. OMG sometimes I wait an hour and a half for my food. Usually they let me know about the wait and are honest with how long it will be, but damn, maybe hire some more people for busy nights? It's been like this since I started ordering from here over a year ago.

-/+ Service. Typically I've had very lousy service on the phone. Twice it was one hour from their closing time and they told me they would not deliver. THIS is what makes me order from a large corporate chain. If they say they close at 9, and you call at 8:45, your order will STILL be delivered. I also had one lady DEMAND my building number (albeit I should know my building number, but no one has ever denied delivery without a building number) and so I hung up and ordered Papa John's. According to her she "wasn't going to send her driver out there with no building number." Um, they have to look at the map anyway, get over it. HOWEVER, my delivery service has always had pleasant drivers. One girl even gave me extra ranch (shout out to you, girl!).

+ Prices. For delivery (and usually if it's fried), this place is pretty good. Good portions and I don't spend more than I would at a corporate chain.

-/+ Coupons. Sure, if you want pizza and wings, you can get some good deals. If you want subs or anything else, probably not your best bet. And to my knowledge, their "deals" have always been the same.

After hearing a friend talk about this place like it's coffee was gold, I decided to check it out.  I've been to 3 Roots at least four times and this is what I've confirmed (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral):

-/+ Service is a 50/50.  Some baristas are awesome, some I'd like to slap back into reality.

- Prices suck.  At 3 Roots I tried the pita/veggie plate and it was definitely not worth the nine bucks.  A few slices of carrots, broccoli and celery, a dab of hummus and a stale pita.  Gross.

+ Vanilla latte.  At least they know how to make the most generic latte in the world.

- I once tried their Irish cream.  I will never again ask for anything that sounds fancy.

I cannot believe this.  I lived in Chandler for eleven years and never discovered this place until I moved to Tempe for college.  Either way, it's a blessing to the earth.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Coffee is fresh and never burnt.  I drink lots and lots of this drug, I know what's up.

-/+ Lots of places to sit, but I just can't get comfortable.  It's too bright inside and the music outside is usually too loud.  However...

+ The joint is located on a lake (man-made of course) and it's beautiful.  Once a friend and I passed on the tables and just sat on the edge of the water. Despite the dead fish smell, which wasn't harsh, it was fantastic.

+ The employees always ask how you are doing.  They are quick to make drinks and never get distracted.

+ Prices are below average.  There are a few items that are a tad overpriced, but in a nutshell this is the place to get an inexpensive good time.

+  PUNCH CARD!! As some of you know, I really like punch cards.  Coffee Rush has them.  Get one.

Please, please, PLEASE do your body good and get your piercing done at HTC.  They are the best in Arizona, I can guarantee you that.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral).  

+ Beautiful selection of jewelry.  They have bone, wood, glass...

+ They know what they're doing.  I actually had my tragus corrected here because the last guy who did it (tattoo shop, of course) did it wrong.

-/+ I have yet to decide what I think of their customer service.  Ninety-nine percent of the time they're very helpful, understanding and polite.  Once, however, I thought one guy was going to have a fit because I took my gauges out.  How was I supposed to know that was unhealthy practice?  Maybe he was just having a bad day...

+ Cheap, but flavorful, drinks.  I always like what I get here.  There is one guy who makes a mean vanilla latte, I have yet to get his name.

+ Food.  Good cakes and cookies.

-/+ I've found that a lot of high school kids like to loiter here (and they're loud).  But, hey, it's not XB's fault.

Oh. My. Goodness.  Since I'm vegetarian, I can only get a bean and cheese burrito (yes, I know the beans are made of lard).  But I still love this place!

+ Prices are cheap!  Good, cheap Mexican food always sounds good to me.

- Location.  Kind of hidden, hard to find.

+ Horchata.  Yes, mmm, horchata.  It's really, really good here.

+ Better than Filly B's by far.  Just the right amount of beans and cheese in a warm but moist tortilla.  Heaven in a wrapper.

So, I only have two tattoos, which means I can't complain TOO much.  I got my second tattoo here and I believe I would recommend this place to a friend who wants to get a cheap, quick tattoo.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Prices are decent.  I got my tattoo done on my back by an apprentice and it was only $100, where most places were charging about $150.

+ Open seating area.  I've been to some tattoo shops that are smaller than my bedroom.  This place is bigger than my apartment.

- Staff could be more friendly.  I visited the place a few times before making my decision to get my ink done here.  Two out of three times I was not satisfied with customer service, but the cleanliness and reputation kept me coming back.

+ Really good at inking simple designs.  My tattoo is large script across my back, and I would have to say it's pretty damn awesome.

Oh sweet, sweet Brio.  I absolutely love this place.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  Yes, it's a chain, but I definitely give props to a restaurant chain that makes food as delicious as Brio.  There are no negatives or neutrals about this place.

+ Wonderful service.  Our waitress was so nice.  She helped me make a decision on my meal and she was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Also, the other employees were happy and spunky.

+ You can add or modify your meal as needed.  A lot of big restaurants (especially more expensive ones) don't allow you do personalize your meal.

+ FOOD.  Oh my goodness.  If you want a meal that is flavorful, cooked right, and unique, you have to try this place.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and it was the best meal I've ever had.  I could taste the different cheeses, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and it melted in my mouth.  My mom ordered a chicken dish and it came with two large chicken breasts and vegetables (she substituted rice for veggies).  Of course, I'm vegetarian and can't eat meat, but the veggies were ridiculous!! They were so delicious.

+ Prices and portions.  Yes, the prices are a tad high, but the portions make it worth it.  I had ten large raviolis stuffed well with mushrooms.  It could easily be split into two meals.

+ Creme brulee.  They have about eight different kinds of creme brulee to choose from.  I ordered the chocolate cake, the original and caramel.  Fantabulous.  Spectacular.  Even if you don't eat a meal here, you MUST try their desserts!!  It will be the best thing you ever do for yourself.

Nice place.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Good coffee.  I forgot what the name is, but I once asked the barista to make me something with lots of chocolate.  It was a mocha made with Ghirardelli chocolate I believe.  I was in love.

+ I've been here three times and every time the employees have been respectful and fast.

- Their food is... well... gross.

+ Good atmosphere.  Great place to study because most of the time loners sit inside and groups sit outside.  If you like alone time when you read/study/whatever (like me), you'll like it here.

- I will sadly have to agree with many other reviews: the prices are not worth the coffee.

For years I rolled my eyes when people talked about "amazing" sandwich shops.  "Seriously," I thought, "How can something as simple as a sandwich be amazing?"  It wasn't until I walked into The Lunch Bag and had my first bite of their (amazing) sandwiches that I really understood. Unfortunately, I no longer work near Scottsdale, nor do I live anywhere remotely close.  I've had to say my goodbyes, but I promise The Lunch Bag, my sweet, I will be back. (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Good ole taste of Mom's cooking... 'cept it's not from her.  I truly reconsidered how great my mother's sandwich making skills are after eating the Turkey Green Chili.  Sorry Mom.  Soups made from scratch, fresh meats and breads, AND COOKIES.

+ Excellent service.  The ladies who work in the kitchen are always happy and cheerful.

+ Pick up orders / delivery.  I personally always took a break from work to stop in, but you can call ahead and pick up, or have them deliver!

-/+ Small dining area.  This is mostly made to cater to the HUGE amount of local business there, so I'm not surprised they only have a handful of table and chairs.  Still a nice place to stop for lunch if you need a break. :)

+ You'd think with all this awesomeness there HAS to be a catch with the cost.  Nope.  It's all affordable delicious goodness.  Definitely competitive prices and I'd pick this place every time.

Whenever you want a refreshing drink, go to Tea Infusion.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Comfy tables and chairs.  It's a bit like a coffee joint, a place to sit, relax, and talk with friends.

+ The tea selection is AMAZING.  I don't drink too much tea myself, but I know my friends like it.  They have fresh tea in boxes and have a very large assortment.

+ You can do so much to your drink.  Blend, ice, hot, boba.  I like to get smoothies (they also put green tea in their smoothies) with boba.  It's delicious.

- Location.  A place like this should NOT be sandwiched between stores in a crappy mall.  It would be better in a shopping center, away from Tempe Marketplace.

-/+ Food is alright.  If you're looking for a snack, good, but if you're looking for a decent sands

A friend of mine works across the street from this place and he gets food here all the time.  He once took me there and this is what I've concluded:  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ TVs for games.  I'm a football girl and I like big flatscreens to watch games on.

+I'm not 21 yet, but this place has a nice feel as far as bars go.

- Food is gross.  Plain and simple.  Yes, I am a vegetarian, but the only thing I didn't eat was the meat... and it still wasn't good.  A burrito should be good with or without meat.

- Open seating.  It's a garage-turned-restaurant (or it least it looks like it) and so the place is WIDE open.  There tall bar stools and tables everywhere and the only nice place to sit is on couch-benches that don't have tables.

-/+  I guess if you're drunk and need a little something-something to eat, this would be a good place to go.  But it's not a good place to get a good meal.

- Prices suck.  If you're going to do it Chipotle style, at least be cheaper than the chain.

For the price that I paid, it was definitely not worth it.  I would understand if it was a school, where stylists are still learning, then you get what you paid for, but that is not true here.  When I got home I noticed an area on my scalp that had dye and melted saran wrap stuck to it, which was super awkward to get out of my hair & now the area is very sensitive.  I also noticed there was a huge bleach stain on my t-shirt as well.  For such an expensive hair cut and dye I don't think I should have had to suffer through peeling dye off my scalp at home or a ruined t-shirt.

This place used to be the best food for the money, now its just another expensive place with good food.

They just recently bump their prices (some things doubled in price) i used to go to this place often for lunch but i'm never going back. I used to get their gluten free for $14 which was kind of pricey this last time i went i paid $21 for the same thing. 

If i'm going to pay this much for a meal i'd rather go somewhere else. 
They just lost a regular client.

Hey all, my 5 star is solely based on the food. I've visited at various times during the day and it seems run well enough, and though it seems to have a fairly large group of regulars it really doesn't bother me, but I know that that could turn some patrons off. HOWEVER, as a Chicagoian who values quality food I can honestly say that Jolies has a menu that's unrivaled in the valley. I've easily tried half a dozen dishes and everything was MUCH better than I expected. The service is always good, and it's easy to flag down a server when things get busy and they seem on top of it. So thanks, Jolie's, for being a place that's been reliably good.

This is unfortunately another lackluster Mexican food place in El Mirage. It is REALLY frustrating. The food has never been bad (as in spoiled,) but the prices are high, and the quality is inconsistent. Sometimes it feels worth it, others I'm disappointed. If this were the only place nearby I'd say it's worth it, but Las Fuentes next to the Surprise theater, or any of the Humberto's taco stands easily beat this place for price and quality.

I've been eating at this CK since they opened ... I think back in 2008. I probably go once or twice a month for breakfast, and occasionally for lunch / dinner. I can say that their management in the past has SUCKED. They've changed managers several times, and can never seem to get a good one. I have no met the current one, I just noticed that the last one I met is no longer there.

The waitresses are usually great. There have only been a couple that have been disappointing, and I haven't seen them around in quite a while.

The breakfast food is pretty standard. Pancakes, waffles, omelets, and all the usual breakfast meats.

Their burgers are decent, but I don't care for any of their other lunch items. Their all you can eat rib or fish & chips nights are a pretty good deal, but I'm not really impressed by their dinner food. However, I've never had anything that wasn't good enough for me to eat till I'm full.

I ordered their (steak of course) fajitas and they were not good ... at all. I LOVE tex-mex, and I couldn't finish them. The onions tasted like they had gone bad, and soured the entire plate. Add to it that there was almost no flavor in the meat (salt and pepper are not the only spices in the world ....) I was extremely disappointed. When your restaurant is NAMED fajitas, you'd better deliver.

This place was TERRIBLE. Of all the Mexican restaurants in El Mirage / Surprise, this is easily the worst. I got the carne asada, and it tasted like they took a flank steak straight from the freezer to the grill with no stopping for seasoning or tenderizing. Chips were cold and unsalted, the salsa tasted like watered down ketchup, the Rice and Beans were inedible, and the Ice Tea tasted like it had sat all day to sour. PLEASE PLEASE, go to Las Fuentes, Rio Mirage, or even the drive through Humberto's next to City Hall before you go here.

I'm a 5th generation native Arizonan, and I don't think I've ever had worse Mexican food in my life.

I always get great service from this store. It's been open since I think around 2003, maybe 2004. I've never had bad food from here. It is a chain, so the food is what you'd expect from a Chick-fil-a. It deffinitely costs more than a chicken sandwich from McDonald's, but I find the spicy chicken sandwiches from Chick-fil-a to be the best fast food sandwich you can get. Just make sure to pick your sauce separately. I had a friend who always complained about them being dry because he didn't know they don't put sauce on there, you get it on the side. After he knew that, he started eating there regularly.

It is fast food though, so don't expect a life changing experience.

My family has been going to Popo's on Indian School Road since the 80's, so it was great to find out that one opened up closer to El Mirage.

This is probably my favorite Mexican Restaurant. The prices are decent, the service is good, and the food is consistently tasty. It's sad that I have to leave El Mirage, a city that got its start as migrant farm worker's housing, just to get great Mexican food, but at least it's only 15 minutes away. I highly recommend the bean dip with fried flour tortilla chips. Can't comment on the bar (I don't drink) but I've never had bad food.

I don't understand all the negative reviews for this place. I've eaten both in the restaurant and had stuff brought over while I'm bowling, and it's always been good. The prices are a bit high, but it's definitely a step up from usual bowling alley food.

I can't comment on the bar, as I don't drink. The food I've had has always been good. They have 1/2 appetizers happy hour on weekdays until 6pm, and most will come in at $5, which for the quality of food is quite decent. I've had a couple of their pizza's, and they're probably the bets pizza in Surprise (which I know, isn't hard to do.)

They do have a bit of a clash as they apear to be trying for a bar and upscale restaurant feel, but they're in a bowling alley / laser tag / arcade establishment .... It can get noisy, and it doesn't really work for kids; though I usually don't see them in there.

I don't drink so this is a review of the food only.

Service was OK, but it was pretty dead, so the waitress's attention wasn't exactly split. I ordered the corned beef and cabbage .... and it was bland and the cabbage was overcooked. Seriously, if you're going for an Irish pub, and you can't get corned beef and cabbage right, what are you selling? The person I was with does drink, and she didn't mind the beer; had the same complaint about the food though ... bland.

This place used to be amazing. I started eating here in late 2007, and they had by far the best General Tso's chicken I've ever had, and very good egg fried rice. Sometime around 2010 it all changed drastically. I've gone back several times since then, and it has not been great, but this last time I went it was just horrible. I ordered the same chicken, but some of the pieces were not cooked through, I had shell in my egg fried rice, and they were both very bland.

It makes me very sad because there really aren't any good Chinese restaurants on the west side, and to say that I'll never go here again is not something I easily do, but this place is just not worth it anymore.

I don't get the big deal with Chipotle. They give you huge burritos, but it's all rice. And for over $6, it's not that worth it. I can go to taco bell and get 2 x 5 layer burrito and have just as much food, and it's mostly meat, not rice. The fact that it's under $3 really makes it hard for me to go to Chipotle and pay twice as much for food that's not much better. If you're wanting good Mexican style food, spend the extra to go to a restaurant. Just be careful in El Mirage, despite having a large Hispanic community, our choices in authentic Mexican food sucks.

I was hesitant to go into here after reading a review of another location...however, now that I have been in 2x for 2 different laptops, I can say I was pleased with their service. They were nice and honest.  

The first issue I had turned out to be a corruption on my hard drive - they told me an estimate of what it would cost and I decided to purchase a new one...so no charge there.  My new laptop received an error so that I could not log on...so took it there for help.  Jeremy gave it a look and took about 15 minutes to determine the problem (created a new profile, deleted the old one), fixed it for me with no charge....hopefully I won't need them anytime soon, but appreciated the fix very much!!

Looked this place up on here hoping to find a diner worth coming to. I give it a low rating because from the start it wasn't good. The young boy & woman servers were rude & had a vibe that we didn't appreciate. When I go somewhere I want to feel welcomed. 

Our server had an attitude as if she didn't want to be there waiting on us. I had the Philly cheese steak & my mother had the American Burger. My sandwich had more onion and peppers then meat. When I want a Philly Cheese Steak I want to to have some steak, not a bun overstuffed with onions & peppers. My plate was messy, as soon as he put it down everything started falling off onto the table. 

My mother was not even a bite into her sandwich when it all started falling apart. The bread seemed to be old and dried out, it kept crumbling up and everything fell out. She stopped eating after that, and when she asked to get it taken off the bill since she barely had anything to eat, our server gave off that negative vibe again. 

Finally as we were leaving, we were getting ready to pay and our server told the young boy to check us out, she told him to take off my moms food and he just gave us this look and rolled his eyes. We asked for military discount which was nice that they had since places never seem to do it anymore. I still don't understand how my philly steak & an ice tea came out to $22. By then we were just over this place and wanted to leave. This place was dirty & just a negative vibe from the start. Never coming here again.  

Please don't waste your time.

This place was always our favorites, but lately the service and environment has been terrible. This used to be a nice environment that made us feel home with the food we grew up eating. The last few times we've been there the food was  not satisfying at all & there's a weird sewage smell that won't go away 

The service was normally good but the young cashier with glasses always has a rude attitude when we get there. I don't know what the problem is but it's always something with my family. 

I wouldn't recommend this place, it was a good place to eat but now overall the service & food is not authentic Hawaiian. I would give no stars if I could.

My roommates & I came here just to relieve from finals week. I wanted to treat my friend out because she was having a bad day. When we were choosing our colors, it felt like they were rushing us. My friend didn't know what color she wanted, so they basically picked one out for her & she just went with it because they wouldn't stop rushing her. 

I went in for a color change & the lady wouldn't stop rushing me to pick a color. She took off the nail polish I already had on which was black, and she left my fingers looking black and dirty. I asked for a matte finish & thinking it would be $5 more, she said $20. When she was finished, she told me to come sit where my nails would dry, she didn't even turn on the machine & just left me there. Did not speak one word to me & just took off. 

My other roommate was getting a pedicure & the guy was being so rude towards her. He was complaining to her that  she picked a color that was too liquidy & clear. She asked to pick a different color and he just ignored her and started painting them anyways. She asked again & then finally he said yes with an irritated look on his face. His body language & attitude towards her was terrible customer service. 

I wouldn't recommend this place. Overall the pedicures were nice & the prices weren't bad. Just the feeling of the negative energy is what made this a no for me.

Pros: Nice rooms, big pool, great working AC
Cons: Room far away from the entrance, water in shower barely got warm, unsafe elevator doors, parking, This is going to be mean, INCOMPETENT STAFF

   My overall experience with the hotel was below mediocre, as indicated by my score. First, I arrived at the hotel and parking for check in was a NIGHTMARE. Granted, it was 4th of July weekend, but you would think they'd have adequate parking for the amount of people they'd anticipate for the holidays. 
  Second, the room they gave me was already taken even though they allegedly checked to see it was free. Apparently, there was a mix up and the room they were supposed to give me was not ready yet. How is that possible? I arrived at 4:30 pm when check in was at 3:00 pm. Plus, not only was check out NOT at noon it was at 10 AM! Five, COUNT THAT, 5 hours to clean a room. I even gave them an extra hour and a half before I checked in and it STILL wasn't flipping ready!? Ridiculous.
   Third, the damn shower. No hot water, at all. It was a measly lukewarm. Might as well have been cold.
   Fourth, parking made me want to cry.
   Fifth, and this one's a doozy, the elevator doors are dangerous. DANGEROUS! A hazard! Why were the doors closing on me even as I was stepping in the middle of them! Where are the fucking motion sensors!To top it all off, those horrendous doors closed on my elderly grandmother and it made her fall on her face. Did the doors open up? NO! She was squished between them and they continued closing! They had to be pried open by not 1 but 2 people. Disgusting.
    And the staff at the front desk? They need a lot of training. Or basic reading skills. If my room is booked or if you gave away my room, mark it off as taken! My family shouldn't have to show you which rooms are available so you give me the right one. Why are they doing your job for you?
   Never will I stay here again. EVER. You want to experience Vegas? Stay somewhere else.

My only con about the pub crawl was the disorganization and the corralling of everyone from bus to club and club to bus.

Other than that, this was a great buy. Three clubs for $49 with the Yelp code? Loved it.

Their bus drinks were kinda sketchy but they had the desired effect so who cares?  

One thing I think they could improve upon is the availability of coupons or deals for drinks in each club. $32 for two cranberry vodkas? No gracias señor. 

Happy Pub Crawling!

We discovered this place just recently and were excited to try it out. So happy we did -- enjoyed all three dishes so much:  roasted beet risotto, spring halibut, and Korean braised beef. I like that the ingredients are organic, locally sourced, and that I had plenty of options that met my dietary restrictions of no dairy or wheat.  Having it all fresh and affordable is awesome. I also picked up a large jar of glutenfree BBQ sauce - another hard to find item. This is a new "fast food" option for us that's miles above typical grab & go fare.

I love Kijiji, but at times it can be a crapshoot; that's why I like to tell people when I find a business that is everything they purport to be and more. Six Tree Removal is definitely the real deal. Tony was very quick to respond to our call and came back with a highly competitive quote. He was exceedingly professional and competent, and exceptionally careful. A number of the sick trees we had removed were taller than 30 feet and Tony managed to fell all of them without hitting our house, our deck, or our shed - something I secretly thought impossible.
 
We unreservedly recommend Six Tree Removal.

This review is geared more toward anyone with curly hair.  And there's a lot of us out there.

Have you ever gone in to a salon that has promised you that they "totally know how to cut curly hair" and walked out looking scarily like Krusty the Klown?  Yeah, me too.  It's SO frustrating.  Everyone will TELL you they can do it and some make a really good attempt at it but they've clearly not been trained in the technique.

Enter Gillian at Get Banged Salon.  She confidently assured me she had many years experience with curly, wavy (and every other) hair so I booked my appointment, hoping she was the Real Deal, and whaddya know she really is.  This girl knows how to cut curly hair.  Dry cut.  With shape ... and style ... that suits your face and your lifestyle!  Go figure!  In no time at all she had transformed my much-loved curls into more loved curls.  No frizz -- no inappropriate products -- no nonsense.  She's a blast to spend time with and I'm glad I found her.  I almost wish I could keep her a secret but jewels like her are WAY too good not to share.  Phone.  Do it.  You'll thank me.

I got really lost looking for this place! Directionally challenged I know. But my excuse is that I'm an international traveler in your fine city!

Anyway, I was starving and was determined to find this joint after reading all these great reviews. I had the 1/4 chicken leg combo, which was translated to me by a really nice couple (the menu is in French FYI). I watched in amazement as the cook chopped up the meat and piled it with a TON of fries!!! The meal could easily feed a family of four! It also comes with rice and a salad. But honestly you can't see what's underneath the giant pile of fries!

The chicken had a lovely taste to it. The spicy sauce wasn't as spicy as I'd like it to be. And everything was a teensy bit too salty. If I had a friend to share it with, it would have been more manageable!  All in all a great neighborhood restaurant. Seems to be hugely popular with the locals. The line was almost out the door!

I was searching for French food that doesn't cost more than my entire wardrobe. I'm so glad I found Le Grand Comptoir on yelp! It's exactly how the entire 2 reviewers described it. It's not intimidating, the prices are reasonable, the waiters are friendly, the portions are substantial. I ordered the pork tenderloin and it's soooo tender!!! It came with a creamy mustard sauce. Mmm mmm! I ate every morsel on my plate, the fries, the salad, the pork! It's a good thing Montreal is a walkable city because I can't stop eating the amazing food!

I went to ChuChai with a vegan friend as it was highly recommended on Yelp. It really didn't disappoint!  I eat meat but love vegetables too and the dishes at ChuCai were delicious!!  We ordered pad thai, vegetarian green curry, and the "love bag" (deep fried little "bags" of vegetables). Everything tasted really good and authentic, especially the pad thai. I'm a noodle snob and I swear by it! 

It's not healthy to eat meat all the time anyway, so all you meat lovers who want to try a vegetarian restaurant, this is the place to go to!

I want to write the review for the entire city of Montreal but unfortunately I can't do that. Instead I'll just have to write about each location I went to. 

Let's just say this is one of my favorites! The sphere is beautiful and I really loved learning about the environment and biodiversity.  The little park across from it is peaceful and beautiful too. 

Montreal is the best city i've ever been to!!!!

What a wonderful place!!! 

My only gripe is that there was no sign coming out of the Jean Talon metro station to point you the right way to the market. Easy for locals but a little confusing for visitors like me.  Thankfully nice folks pointed me the right direction. It was about a 10 minute walk to the market and I didn't expect it to be so huge!  Love the fruits and vegetables selection, everything looked beautiful and even laid out perfectly!  The flowers were gorgeous too.  There were all these little cafes for a leisurely lunch. 

I was really impressed with the "rent a bicycle" station next to the market.  There's no such thing in California, at least not a do-it-yourself type of thing. 

Montreal keeps impressing me over and over again!

Hector was friendly, he had everything that was needed and he took the time to complete the job right, and now my AC is better than before. Thanks The AC Guys! 

Tony also came back to check up on the AC since the unit started to not blow out cool air. Tony was very efficient, friendly and had everything he needed to complete the job. The AC Guys are awesome at what they do. I will definitely recommend them!

Do not take your photos there. It is way too expensive. They charged us $30 for only 2 set of 2 passport photos for my wife and myself (4 photos in total). The owners of this place are very greedy and take advantage of the newly opened Canada Passport Office located above their store. Do yourself a big favor and go somewhere else where you can get passport photos for $10 or less. Also, the rest of their merchandize in the store is just ridiculous in terms of quality. Stay away.

I brought my 5 yr old grandaughter here for an exam they got me in the same day. Dr. Fetchel is a great doctor he was very patient and gentle with her. The staff made the visit fun they helped her pick out the perfect pair of glasses. She is so excited to wear them. 5 star service . I will definitely  be bringing the rest of my family here.

Went for a friend's birthday dinner on a Thursday night. There were others in the restaurant, but it wasn't packed. The food was okay, but our group wasn't wowed. We were seated upstairs and had some delayed service as our server seemed to also be working the bar. I'll give it another shot to try other dishes. I really liked the decor, just expected more from the rest of the experience.

I found this yoga studio through a deal site and fell in love in my first two visits. The studio is small, but provides a great community of yogis. The instructors are awesome, providing guidance throughout the class and correcting postures or  encouraging us to take our practice deeper when they see the opportunity. Both Jillian and Megan have been able to guide me into postures that I've always struggled with and had a lot of self doubt. In a single session they each were able to provide the right instruction for me to feel comfortable and find success in those new postures.

Tried this place again for a friend's celebratory dinner. We had another server on her 'first day'. She seemed sincere and I believe her, but I've also gotten this excuse before.  Tonight one order didn't come out at all and one came out with an incorrect mix of rolls. The story was another server grabbed the plates, but it took another 30 minutes after acknowledging the mistake to be served our original order. Very disappointing!

Good food, but service was slow. We arrived as a bunch if tables were turning over, so I thinks tickets got mixed up in the kitchen. At least two groups who were seated after us were served & finished eating before we got our meals. Our server was attentive in keeping our chips, salsa, and drinks refreshed. She apologized for the delay and noted the manager was in the kitchen cooking to help catch up the backlog. I will return for the food, but hope for a better orchestrated service.

After searching a number of jewelers years ago, I stumbled upon Malak Jewelers with a good selection of watches - just the item I was shopping for. They provided good service for a number of purchases my family made, but it seems things have changed recently. After receiving a ring for Christmas I took it in to be resized and was warned by the lady that I should keep a little extra room as your fingers may measure small in the winter. I had to pay to have the ring resized even when though it was a gift from their store, which seems like a service they should offer along with the purchase. When I got it back it did still seem too large and could spin around my finger, but they gave the same guidance. I waited a few months for the weather to warm up and the ring is still too large. When I returned to the store, they wanted to charge me another resizing fee to 'fix' it, even though it was upon their guidance that I accepted the 'roomier' fit in the first place. I'm really disappointed in their service and the general manner in which they now seem to be doing business. They've lost me and my family as clientelle.

I bought one of the Arrichion deals last winter and attended my first few classes with the mad rush of others who jumped at the discounted classes. It is not the gym for me. While I have tried my fair share of hot yoga studios, this one felt very impersonal. The routines were just that. . . the same thing every class. I like yoga because it is generally a more personal practice where the instructors lead everyone to find a personal level accomplishment and each class varies in the flow. I didn't get the same sense of trust or guidance since the Arrichion instructors did not provide any one-on-one correction or clarification. I know I need help finding some of the postures. I'll have to look elsewhere.

It was my first time here and the food was amazing. The service was great. I ordered a 12 oz filet mignon and although pricey I have to say it was worth it. Would I come back again? No, because once is enough and I'd rather save money to try other things. But I would like to recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try some good steaks.

They compute your tax after they add an automatic 18% service fee. 

The server brought me a wrong dish the first time. The meat in the burger is over-cooked. It tastes really bad.

Huge portion too. The pork belly tacos are smoked wings are the newest favs fir me. Atmosphere is great too. Always lively and not too many jerks present. Go go go yo!!!

Great little spot. I stopped in for some wine and eats and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is spot on and has a laid back feeling. The particular wine I ordered was fantastic but the food was what impressed me. Even the simple bread board was awesome. Some olive oil on the side with some sunken balsamic .... yum. The lardon bruschetta board was unreal. The homemade mayo spread was creamy and dilish. The owner Jim introduced himself and was super friendly. I'm really diggin this joint and plan on returning soon. Clev Hts needed a non Lee Rd'ish spot like this.

Coming here for many years and this is my first bad experience. The food was still great, but the service and the new policy of not allowing you to have a sample tasting of wine before ordering , spoiled my excitement about eating here again. We like to try different wines and the server interaction and suggestions about wine was always a highlight of the meal.

Came with friends to celebrate wedding anniversary, we liked the food and the wine (great selection), but what made us give a 5 stars was the service from our waiter Pedro. He helped us get started with the tapas menu, great suggestions and the way he handled the wine made the meal complete. Would for sure visit again and we hope Pedro still there.

The Habit Burger Grill is such a great place to go out to enjoy a burger! It's a grill with quality service and quality food. Its a small casual place where you can sit with a group of friends, laugh and enjoy your food. The place is welcoming and friendly, the employees are great workers by showing pride in their job. You can walk in and right away fall in love with the place. 

Adding to it is the food ! The burgers are juicy and well made, they aren't like the other fast food where the burger has bad presentation. They have everything a buyer needs and you can even adjust it to your pleasure.The wait is a little long but its worth it. The fries are the best I've tried, they are crispy and have great flavor. The place its self is also great ! its clean, and the style is nice. Its not too loud and its family friendly. My brother took me and my nephews had a great time enjoying our burger at Habit Burger Grill.

First time in the Charlotte area so I wanted to try something local instead of a chain. The hostess walked us through the menu and was very helpful and welcoming. I picked the pulled pork platter with sides of sweet potato casserole and collard greens. My daughter had a side to spare so I had her select the banana pudding. All I can say is Wow! Everything tasted delicious! Not a big collard greens fan but heard these were to die for. Yep. They were. Sweet potato casserole was fresh out of the oven (hot!). Pork was tender and juicy although a might warm, not hot. Corn bread was awesome as well even though I prefer mine a little bit sweeter. Topped off with banana puddin' that was just like my moms used to make with a 'Nilla wafer on top. Sweet tea of course to wash it all down. I will definitely be going back there next time I cime around. Yum.

We came here for a good inexpensive breakfast & that is exactly what we got. They have big portions. So sharing is good if u don't want to be stuffed. We had the cheese omelette w/hash browns & a pancake. It was all great, the hash browns are outstanding, taste homemade. The pancake is enormous, light & fluffy but thick @ the same time. All in all a good breakfast @ a great price.

We were staying at the Boulders resort which is only about 2 miles away from the restaurant. We found the restaurant on Yelp after having tried the restaurants at the hotel (which were overpriced and the food was just ok). Forgot our waitress' name (I think it was Corina) but she was super friendly, offered suggestions and explained the dishes to us- we weren't too familiar with Brazilian food. We tried the Feijoada and the Picanha, both dishes were delicious! Service was fast and friendly! Would highly recommend this place!

Went in for the first time today for the awesome price on the smog check.  The workers were pleasant but condescending.  After about a 10 minute wait, the technician informed me that it failed due to the gas cap seal starting to crack with age, but everything else was fine.  He then handed me the invoice with all of the other "recommended services" to the tune of $1105.00. The guy at the counter then told me that once I bought a new gas cap and came back he would charge me the $10 again and redo the whole thing.  After buying a new gas cap, I took my business to another inspection center.  The gentleman there was incredulous they would charge me twice when it was only the gas cap.  In short, go elsewhere to people who care about their customers and not just the money.

I have sought out a good time countless times with Sagos many times over the years. It is a great place to hang out and throw a few back. They have a decent happy hour with appetizers and sliders for 5.00. The food started off awesome and then took a down turn. That kitchen crew has since been replaced and the food is back on par. I love the spicy pickles and the mac  and cheese bites. The drinks prices are decent but best during happy hour. The staff remembers your name and your drink. The owner will also show up and just sit and chat with you.  The bathrooms are always clean which o can appreciate. There is always a good time to be had at Sagos. You have to check it out at least once.

This place is amazing. The crust is thin and crisp like a cracker. The flour used is from Naples,the water used to make the dough is flown in from Boston. That to me says quality and care. The sauce used has no added sugars or salt. The tomatoes actaully come from Modesto Cal. This place is AMAZING. The fact that they use high quality ingrediants is important. It is very much worth trying.

Dillard's is utterly disgusting and trashy. The employees are unhelpful and not trained for their department. Even worse they pressure you into getting the in store charge card. I repeatedly told the sales associate that I did not want the in house charge card. I had to tell her no at least five times. I later found out that associates have to open at least one charge card per day they work or they receive a write up. I also found out that if they do not sell enough in a quarterly period they receive a 10% pay cut. How despicable! !!!

Finally tried Olives at the Bellagio.  My husband and I love Mediterranean food and we love hummus and butternut squash ravioli.  We were seated right away and the service was great. We were brought a yummy assortment of olives and a basket of olive bread and crusty parmesan crisps (both very tasty).

This afternoon we ordered the Greek salad and Hummus to start off. The Greek salad was one of the best that I have ever had and I order it a lot at various restaurants. The hummus, however, looked delicious but had way too much Cumin in it (I'm pretty positive it was Cumin)... it ruined what should have been a delicious beginning. 

We ordered the Butternut squash Tortelli and the Scallops, which came on a bed of Risotto. The scallops were good but the risotto was just acceptable and nothing to write home about. The Tortelli, on the other hand, was definitely forgettable. The sauce tasted like a beef gravy and you would never know there was butternut squash in the pasta... it was disappointing.

Because the Greek Salad and breads were so incredible, I would give Olives another chance and hope that other menu selections are better.

First time to Calgary and not sure where to eat. Asked the front desk and they gave us two or three suggestions. We decided to try this one and i sure did not regret it. Don't let the run down building fool you. This was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. Coffee was good and the toast is great along with  the sausage and eggs. Also had a fruit cup and it was yummy and the fruit ripe... even the blackberries.

To get to the point of why I gave a well deserved 2 stars, it is because when they gave us the bill, the waiter wrote in his own gratuity and gave himself a 20% tip.  I could tell right away they treat groupon holders different from other customers.  

They told us twice ( once when we made a reservation , and when we came in) that you have to tip on the total cost, all before they let us order.  They ask if you are a groupon holder, then they flag your name on the reservation .  

Gratuity is supposed to be my discretion , I know I could of made them remove it and tipped what I wanted, but I decided not to ruin my dinner .  They think it's their God given right to do that?  It was not written as a suggested tip, but as the total.   Can you believe it?  They are giving groupon holders a bad name.  

The food?  Better than their boldness

The flavor of the noodles were definitely good, however not only is the fried chicken bowl impossible to eat, the chicken we had was not edible to say the least. It comes as a drumstick on top of a bowl of noodles and soup, how are you supposed to cut it off the bone with no plate, unless you slosh your soup everywhere? Picking it up and eating it isn't exactly useful because then you're eating a chicken leg and then some noodles afterward? It should be a cohesive dish, not a challenge. 
Regarding the fact that it was inedible, let's just say it was cut into and we felt uneasy eating it....
Shortly after we overheard a woman asking for a refund due to her chicken.. so definitely don't get it lol.

I decided to take my brother here for his birthday dinner since I couldn't make it to our scheduled family dinner. Even though it was only the two of us, we had to wait half an hour to get seated - but they did text you 10mins before a table cleared for you so you don't have to wait outside the establishment in the cold. 

It was worth the wait! 

I had the blackfish cod (best fish I've ever eaten) and the tofu which was nice. My brother had the bbq pork and bibbimap (I spelt this wrong, didn't I?) Both of which tasted great! For dessert I had the lovely green tea creme brulee and to drink the bamboo cocktail (I loved how they garnished it).

Ended up in Mississauga a bit early for an appointment so we decided to stop in here for a quick bite. 

We only ordered Japanese dishes, and the tempura was done perfectly and the sushi tasted great. Service was very attentive, though we did get confused because there was a service call button and we didn't get service when we used the call button, but we got great when we weren't using it. 

The space itself it cozy and intimate, I like that they had enclosed spaces for larger groups, but even as a group of two it felt comfortably partitioned. 

Would definitely go again!

Everytime I come here, the service is friendly but today, I ordered Takoyaki, and I had asked if it was ok for me to get wasabi and mayo on them instead of choosing mild OR spicy. Unfortunately our server said no, which is when I asked her if she could just charge me extra for the mayo if i ordered spicy which she said no again. I dont understand why she couldn't have just charged me for the mayo, all she advised me to do was tell me to buy 1 spicy and 1 mild takoyaki. Unbelievable!!

This place has a good environment, it seems cleanlier than the other pho restaurants. The food is really good for the price and it tastes authentic to asian cuisine. The pho bowls and the vermicelli dishes are to die for. All the servers here are really nice, and have amazing service. They're really cool and have an amazing aura to them. Overall, I have an amazing dining experience every visit here and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good hearty bowl of pho.

Been here countless times, limited options during the lunch hrs, the store looks fairly brand new, service sometimes is really fast, sometimes uber slow. The ipad ordering is cool. The food is pretty mediocre though, ive definitely had better but this place is better than the one down the street called Kagonei's! Be sure to taste the cheese wontons, its the best thing on that menu!

Not sure if I had come here at a bad time,  but came here back in february with my family almost around closing and didnt notice at first, but as we sat there longer, we noticed that there was a bit too many little fruit flies flying around us for comfort as we ate. Dont remember what the food tasted like because i was too concentrated on swatting away flies from my face.

This is one of my favourite salons in this city. Each visit has been a warm experience, the entire staff is super welcoming and professional. I mainly visit Felicia, an exceptional colourist who has been supportive of my hair journey bringing me from virgin hair to a natural golden balayage. Since I had not coloured my hair in ten years, I was (and am) truly terrified of colour processing my hair. Felicia is always informative and communicates each step to ease my tension. She is attentive to fine details, as a professional colourist she is considerate of the demands of my hair type and knows the tools and science behind processing without tremendous damage. Her technique leaves my hair looking natural and polished, I am always pleased with the outcome. 
Since she's been working on my colour I have received a lot attention and compliments on the colour tone and balayage style, and recommend anyone looking for an experienced colour technician to visit her.

Sometimes I come here to read a book, and it's especially cozy when you get a window seat and have the sun shining on your back while it's cold outside. It's pretty quiet here during the day so I like coming when I feel like  taking a walk and a break from the office.

All their drinks are pretty overpriced, but their ambience is on point. How can I describe it? The wooden paneling give it a rustic vibe, but it kind of also has a modern vintage twist. Littered throughout the store are also offerings of vintage-type goods (they were/are selling a typewriter) as well as cards (think birthday cards) and they use barrel as display tables. The staff are really nice, and they don't kick me out if I want to just stop by and sit down to absorb the ambience. 
The only menu item I've tried so far is their mint tea which they brew using tea leaves and not a tea bag. But that also justifies a price hike, about $5 for a normal cup of tea. I might as well order the leaves online. I have yet to get the expensive coffee here, but when I do, I'll give an update.

I am so disappointed with this hospital. This was the second time I came here, and each time was a HUGE disappointment. I am never returning. EVER. The vet's name is Melissa Schupp. 

 First, I arrived around 2:35 on a Sunday afternoon. I called two hours ahead of time to schedule an appointment because I knew Sundays would be busy; this is because many other animal hospitals are not open on Sundays. My dog was suffering from unknown allergic reactions with skin rashes left and right. I had just adopted him, and his skin had recently become infected and rotten-smelling.
 I called ahead of time, gave my details , a $77 quote and they reserved a room for me. When I arrived  the room was already reserved and I was led straight in. I initially thought I was going to have a great experience because of the quick room preparation but BOY was I wrong. When I was led into the room that was "prepared," there was water all over the floor and the front desk lady hastily used paper towels to clean it up. I waited the standard 30 minutes in the smelly room until the nurse came into to check details, run temperature and give my dog a general physical. Then she left for AN HOUR. By this time it  was already 3:35, and my dog was whining from pain and discomfort in a closed off room. When the nurse returned and began to write down symptoms, my dog actually started peeing on floor. I didn't know what to do because I had no cleaning materials with me, so the nurse stepped into action and dropped a few paper towels on the ground. She didn't manage to soak up all the urine, so when she moved around, my dog was pushed into it and it ended all over my clothes when she asked for my to carry my dog onto the checkup table.

To make things worse, she left again for another hour, and checked in after the 40 minute mark to tell me the veterinarian would be with me after 1 minute. Ten more minutes passed and no one came. My dog was whimpering more and more at this point. Finally at 4:30, the vet comes in, smiling and kind, and asking me for doggie symptoms. I ask her about fleas, but I swear, this place was so profit driven that the VET DID NOT EVEN CHECK MY DOG FOR FLEAS BEFORE GIVING ME A PRESCRIPTION ON MY FLEA MEDICATION. The mere mention of "I think my dog might have fleas but I don't know how to check for them" initiated a conditioned response "I'll prescribe flea medication" WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE DOG. I asked kindly to hint to her that my dog might not have fleas because the itchiness could be a symptom of allergies. She then shows me how to check for fleas, but doesn't find any as she shows me. She continued to write down a prescription for fleas on my bill without my knowing. Is this a professional business? How can they cheat people like this!
As I continued to ask questions to make sure what my dog had, the nurse seemed to reply with more things to run up my medical bill. She gave my dog a unnecessary skin scrape for mites TWICE even though SHE SAID that it didn't seem like my dog had mites, she performed and charged me for the scrape all the same. Because I had never needed to have these operations performed, I did not know that it was an extra $30 to have skin scraped. She went to look at the scrapes under the microscope, and returned another hour later. By this time, it was 5:30 and my patience was running low. For three hours, I sat in a stuffy room, covered in urine and staring at my miserable dog scratching his skin to bloody scabby bits as the doctors and nurses neglected the both of us. Honestly, I was so frustrated, I didn't even know what to do.  I had never experienced such a horrible medical visit. 

Around 5:35 when she returned, she apologized for being gone for an hour, and she said she had to look over a pet with a "real emergency." I'm not here to disqualify her statement, because I understand that this is a real animal hospital and that other people may have pets who are dying. But I also understand that this is a FOR-PROFIT animal hospital, and if they don't even have enough vets to go around that I have to wait three hours for something that takes less than 50 minutes, I truly will never EVER recommend this place or ever set foot near this place again.
 After she came back, she confirmed my dog had no mites, and gave me a pet "cone of shame" that I had asked for earlier. She told me it was $15 cone, and gave me flea medication and antibiotics for the infection. She hardly looked at my pet. The only part of the visit that was clear to my mind was that she kept saying "ow" when my dog nibbled at her fingers.
I excitedly hurried out and paid my bill. EXCEPT IT WAS $207. I let the vet CUT MY DOG for $32, the flimsy cone was $30 in addition to the $29 un-needed flea meds. I cried.
I think my only mistake was coming to this hospital. Be wary of coming here as the more questions you ask to get a better idea of your dog's condition, the more services and products they try to shove down your throat to earn revenue.

I haven't been to many Charlotte breweries, but I can see why Sycamore has a cult following. In addition to having a super memorable and cute logo, they have a lot of space for large events and a minimalist venue making it a versatile brewery for holding events. Today for the Panther's tailgate, they had Tin kitchen's food truck in the back for hungry folk to annihilate. I'm new to the idea of bars without food offerings inside but I find this model genius; Sycamore itself doesn't have a kitchen, instead has partnerships with local food trucks so that the menu changes every time you come. What is special about them is that they do have a wide array of special brews to choose from, so for the adventurous beer drinker, this is the perfect place for people who get bored of beer that taste just like beer. They have special brunch beer cocktails which seem to change weekly. I haven't tried them personally but they look and sound pretty interesting! Bloody Mary beer cocktail anyone?

 In particular for fall, I enjoyed their Cinnabun Brown Ale, Sweet Potato Wheat, Pumpkin Latte Blonde, and Gourd Have Mercy Pumpkin Amber. A pint of gourd Have Mercy Pumpkin Amber on a Sunday ran me $6, -not bad. While we watched the Panthers game inside, live music was running outside which was enjoyable once the game ended. I can imagine it being packed for weekly tailgates on days with home games, but when it is not busy, it is a very nice brewery to just sit and relax in. I haven't been here after work yet, but I always see it lit up and populated on the ride home from the light rail. We didn't see any typical backyard games like horseshoe, corn hole or giant Jenga, so I think it's a good place to go for a chill night of hanging out. But when there are special promotions or events going on, you can count on me that I'll be back.

Great beer selection, even for an amateur like me. There was a line out the door on a Wednesday evening. It was cozy, almost like having a large house party. The beer on tap is the greatest since sliced bread. Allow your customers to serve themselves, and you'll surpass records of beer sold during your first weekend of operations. You can try and be loyal to one beer, but It's quite inexpensive to get a sampling of each (and there are dozens of beers on the wall) - beers range from 30cents an ounce to a few dollars. The wristband is convenient, just scan your band on the little hop engraving under each tap, and it will activate. Angle your glass before you press the nozzle (this is how you avoid a glass full of foam) and pour away. This place is cozy in the winter but would also be great during the summer as well. Bring a date, or bring a crowd and have a pizza party here- it's a place you have to check out if you're in the area. Restaurants around Hoppin are also pretty good so if you don't eat here, you can always hop across the street to Seoul kitchen.

Came here in pursuit of a local small coffee shop that ain't Starbucks! It's very homey- the table tops are made out of wood grain and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The cashier is all smiles.  You think there are only three tables but you look to your left and there's a whole other seating space to take advantage of. I came here right before the said happy hour and got a medium cappuccino sprinkled with hot chocolate powder for $3.75 (with tax). I saw that they also offered breakfast items that are similar to Bluestone Lane in NYC, like the avocado smash bagels and avocado eggs Benedict.  The drinks are all under $4, but the price of the menu items seem to make up for the difference. A fruit cup will set you back $5. However, my friend ordered a bagel and it was served on a nice platter. Good service and good environment. Bring a friend and have a coffee chat! It's quiet in the afternoon.

Sushi was great and inexpensive. Yes, they are famous for their sushi lunch buffet, but I have never been there for that! I declare that as the next frontier to conquer...

I had read on some Charlotte email newsletters that Oku sushi was great and had won some kind of Charlotte sushi award, but I don't think you can compare Rusan's to Oku. Sure, they both serve the same thing, but the indoor ambiance really makes a difference on the dining experience. Oku sushi is more of a hipster sushi place that you'd go on a first date on, and dress up a little more to, while Rusan's really focuses on value of their sushi while exuding classic characteristics of Asian restaurant by having sticky tables and crumbs on booth seats. I wouldn't be scared to come here donned in athleisure-wear and tennis shoes. But hey, I like where their priorities are at (sushi crafting). I guess since I mentioned it with Oku, I have to say by no means would I not take someone on a first date to Rusan's- if I knew anyone who shares the same passion for fish as I do, this would be my go-to date night restaurant. It's not hipster, but it's definitely not trashy. Your chopsticks might be disposable, but the flavor variety and sushi-eating experience is everlasting.

 For $10, you can get anywhere from 2-4 rolls at Rusan's, while you barely can get an appetizer at Oku. Service is fast, and their fried iced cream dessert is absolutely delicious. They have so many rolls to try, so it will be awhile before I get tired of coming here. With two medium sized adult asian females, we downed five rolls and a fried iced cream and the bill came out to be $20 each.

 I'd take a huge group of friends here, or just eat and catch up with one friend. Either way, I can't wait to go back for the buffet, but since my office is just out of range from here, I guess I'll have to wait for a holiday.

Had a casual lunch here. The savory crepe was delicious, but the cheese became too much after awhile. It's a bit hidden in an office building but it's a great place to take people /coworkers for lunch. It's different from what I usually have (sandwiches, bowls) so every once in awhile I like coming here to change things up. Anything on the savory menu is good. Personally the pesto is great, but definitely try the curry as well! (There's a good kick of spice in it)

I love this little ice cream shop and enjoy their ice cream immensely.  I've visited their shop at least 10 times over the last 7 months.  Their peanut butter - chocolate ice cream is probably the best ice cream I've ever had. Truthfully I would visit more often but their service is awful.  Allow me to explain -

EVERY SINGLE TIME I visit they are out of something.  If I want to order a banana split they are out of bananas.  If I order a sundae that comes with strawberries, they are out of strawberries.  They always have the same excuse, Oh my manager just went to the store to get some more (insert missing item), is it okay without?  One time I was told, we are out of bananas, I suggested a discount for a banana split without bananas and suddenly out of nowhere, a banana was found.

Another thing I've noticed is, I never see the same ice cream makers in the store, always a new fresh face.  As a result, what I order is NEVER consistent.  One visit I will get a generous serving of whipped cream, the next visit hardly any.  Next visit I will get an entire sliced banana, the next 6 thin slices.  Obviously there are issues with the management and ownership of this cute and yummy little ice cream shop as this can all be traced back to them.    I wish they would get their act together and provide consistent customer service instead of excuses.

Hello, today I visited SkinnyFATS for the first time.  I rated it 3 stars, parts of my visit were impressive, others were not.  Allow me to divulge.  The menu and food selection are great.  Wide variety of offerings, prices in-line with what you get.  I was impressed and excited to get on with my meal.  I ordered from the Things in Bowls section of the menu, and opted for the Smoke in a Bowl.  The meal was good, I would have it again, filled me up, plenty of chicken, plenty of vegetables, nice flavor.  It was good, nothing to write home about, but good.  One thing I noticed, not sure exactly what black bean salsa is at SkinnyFATS, but I didn't see a single black bean in my bowl.  It was very dark where I was sitting in the restaurant so maybe I just couldn't see it.

The customer service left a lot to be desired.  It's all about training your employees, some owners/ managers take it seriously, others don't.  The person that took my order was great, friendly, helpful, nice smile.  I should mention I was asked to provide ID as I was using my debit card.  I assume SkinnyFATS has been burned repeatedly by their customers using debit/ credit cards that don't belong to them, hence they card you, doesn't say much about their clientele overall.  Also, I ordered a Coke, I was truly surprised when I got to the soft drink fountain and Coke wasn't an option.  Seems that should have been mentioned to me.  The person that brought me my food, didn't say a word to me, not one.  I offered a Hello and a Thank You as my food was delivered... my words were completely ignored.  Very common courtesy dictates, especially in a retail/ business type of establishment that when offered a Hello or a Thank You by a customer, a simple reply is good business.  I assumed the person that delivered my food was having a bad day at work.  As I was enjoying my Smoke in a Bowl one of the staff was busy clearing and cleaning the table next to me.  As this person started to vigorously sweep the floor beneath and around the table next to me, I lost my appetite.  Sweeping the floor stirs up dust and whatever else is on the floor.  In my head I was imagining all sorts of debris floating around in the air and landing on my table and on top of my Smoke in a Bowl and in my off-brand Coke.  I was disgusted and soon stopped eating.

SkinnyFATS and another restaurant I consider to be very similar in concept, Greens and Proteins, are welcome additions to the Las Vegas restaurant scene in my opinion.  Next time I'll probably head to G&P where I always get top notch food AND service.

Late post. I stayed here from August 23 to the 26th for a Birthday trip. I loved this place it was exactly what i seen online. My room was clean, nice and quiet. I wanted a view of the city and i got an amazing view on the 50th floor. My room was non smoking once i got out of the room the hall smelled like smoke. I was never bothered by the staff and they were nice and friendly. My check in and check out process was very fast. Only thing i was bummed about was the pool it was nice but small and closed early. Wish it was open late everything else seemed to be open. I would stay here again.

I took yelps advice and it didnt do me wrong . When i arrived i was greeted by some very friendly staff. I felt very welcomed. Means alot when your traveling alone. First thing i noticed about this place was the cute decor different but i liked it. Especially the use of different kind of chairs. They gave me time to figure out what i wanted and made great suggestions. I ordered food was good and i was full. Only thing that wasnt my favorite was the water but i think thats a city problem . I checked in with yelp to get a free mimosa. Mmmmm. Kinda strong but they dont play in Vegas. My bill was very affordable. The mananger was even nice enough to seat down and give me suggestions on what i can do here. Very nice and sweet of him. Go check them out.

After a rough morning a good lunch was in order and that I found at Blue Sky. Me, my wife, and my cousin
 I was blowin away at how delicious the food was, I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak Supreme and so did my cousin and OMG is had me wanting more even though I was full. My cousin (who is pregnant atm) said that she was full and said she couldn't help herself it was good she had to keep eating. She said it must be the baby telling me he likes blue sky lol.
  So if your in the area I highly recommond stopping thru, dont know about the latenights but great during the day, and dont be fooled like I was by the look, the food is good.

I have passed this place a few times and the great smells had snatched me by the nose and smackec my tasted buds for me to turn around. So finally with sometime on my hands me and my wife stopped in. The menu was full of things I wanted to try all at once but I finally went with the Souvlaki Platter and my wife ordered the Baked Ziti, the prices were very reasonable and I was greatly impressed for how small the resturant is. My greek salad was fresh even for it being late at night and my marinated pork was so delicious that my tongue smacked my brains for not stopping before. My wife's ziti was obviously good cause she was giving it praises like no other lol, no to mention the portions were very hefty. The experience wouldnt have been excellent if it wouldn't have been for the ever forgetful waitress. Highly recommonded.

I've eaten here many times and in general it's fairly good but all the food pretty much end up having the same taste. Everything is OK (really I haven't had anything bad there) but I haven't had any kind of food that stands out either. 

It's a good place for lunch with colleagues but there's definitely much better Mexican food around.

This review is based on 3 separate visits to Fate. The beer was decent (not great but good enough) but the food is just very, very poor. Over 3 visits (ate at each one) one experience was mediocre (pizza came out OK, appetizers mediocre) and the other 2 the food was really just awful. I think they might need to be on Kitchen Nightmares.

I have to say that this is our favorite arabic (lebanese style) restaurant in the scottsdale/tempe area.  Food is consistently good - in the several times we've eaten here were were only ever disappointed by a single lentil soup that we ordered and they took it back with no questions.

All of the grilled meat is good as is the baba ganoush and hummus. Falafel is also really excellent.

Went here for brunch and was quite disappointed. I got chorizo benedict and my wife got farmhouse omelet.  My eggs whites were somewhat underdone, which doesn't bother me too much but even these were really on the undercooked side, my wife's omelet was good but somewhat small, however, our potatoes were terrible... over salted deep fried hash brown pieces.

Waiter looked and acted like he's just been dragged out of bed and wanted to be just about anywhere else but there - and ambiance/music was kind of noisy too.

My wife and I absolutely love this place. We lived in Japan for many years and it's very rare to find a restaurant with authentic Japanese taste in the US. Hire Sushi definitely has it though.

Tip: try sitting at the sushi bar (walk in only) and listen to the chefs banter in Japanese. Even if you don't understand it it will be fun.

Ridiculously overrated hipster food. Crappy coffee, that they sweeten for you. we asked for sweetener and were told they would do it for us.  Apparently they dont trust us to sweeten our own coffee with their "craft" ingredients.  One plate came out cold and 5 min before our other plate.

The bathrooms are hidden behind a partition with ZERO indication that they are bathrooms. I never got a coffee refill, strange for a "coffee bar."

Altogether $30 for two people to have crappy coffee. We sent one back in exchange for an espresso. It was better tasting.  The food tasted ok, not great and definitely not worth $12-$14 a plate. The coffee SUCKED.  

I will be going back to The Egg and I.  Fuckin Denny's beats this place.  But, it's trendy.  Great place if you care about being trendy.

My mom and I had such wonderful experiences at Ave 22! I first discovered them when I walked by and saw all of their veils in the front window. I popped in without an appointment and they were very welcoming and accommodating. After I showed them a photo of my dress and told them about my wedding and what I was looking for, the consultant said she had the perfect veil for me. It was gorgeous! Simple and elegant, but very dramatic. Their prices were also incredibly reasonable. I wasn't able to make a decision at that time, but they created a file for me and kept the veil on record. When it came time for my mom to look for her dress I recalled how many absolutely gorgeous mother of the bride and bridesmaid dresses I walked by on my way to look the veils. After going to several bridal stores in Vancouver, I suggested that my mom take a look at Ave 22. She had a really good idea of what she wanted, but couldn't find it anywhere and was having a hard time describing it to her consultants. We met with Cara at Ave 22. She was an excellent listener and has the patience of a saint! We went through a lot of dresses, and Cara was always kind and caring, and helped us with eliminating what wasn't working. Their assortment was so wonderful that we ended up finding two amazing dresses for my mom. She couldn't decide between the two, but their prices were so excellent that she ended up buying both. I also came back to try on the veil I had originally looked at. When I saw it on with my dress it was absolutely gorgeous and exactly what I was looking for. I had previously gone to Kleinfeld for look at veils and accessories, and found that I liked Ave 22's selection far more than Kleinfeld's. Thank you to Shirley, the owner, and Cara for such  wonderful and stress free experiences. I would highly recommend them to all of my girlfriends. My only regret is not finding them before I bought my wedding dress.

I hate to have to give, only 4 stares. All in all, the pizza was great. Wings, really really good, but..... , they were very small wings. Size does matter. Plus it was a one hour wait, for the delivery. That came from, just up the street. Time wise, a little excessive. But after all, it was still a great meal. And it was worth it.

I have been going here for 2 months now and I love it! If you want to lose/gain weight and get in shape, come here! Sid changes up your workout every day and motivates you to do things you didn't even know you could do. I feel better and stronger every time I leave. Plus, you can come in any time during business hours and train for as long as you want! It's amazing. After my first week, I was hooked. You can see and feel a difference and it's addicting.

Awful. The owners are so rude and the nail specialist are very unprofessional. DO NOT COME HERE

I came here because of the great reviews on Yelp but I am extremely disappointed with the customer service and the way my nails came out by Ani. I will never come back here. 

I would recommend luxury nails or creative nails, they are both nearby.

Ok, so  this is my second time here in 3 weeks, and my husband and I are quite judgmental when it comes to Italian food.  We have our local favorites and were excited to try Giuseppe's as we love the venue for its outdoor dining patio.  So charming with the gas heaters and trellis and mood lighting and music.  What more could you ask for?  Well, yes, the amazing food!  We tend to judge our dining experience on the bread and salad to start.  If they are great, we know we are to expect great entrees, and they do not disappoint.  Fresh, hot bread with delicious olive oil and balsamic for dipping.  The salads included with the entree (rare these days) are crispy fresh and include many toppings, even cheese!! Not just some lettuce on a plate with some dressing.  Between the two of us we have now had four different entrees, and ALL delicious.  I cannot wait to try the next time something new. They have a great happy hour wine and appetizer selection, and if you get past that, the entrees are enough to bring home for lunch the next day, LOVE that!  You MUST try, you will be happy you did!

Beware!  My son just came from this dentist office with an appointment for full mouth xrays, a dental exam, and a cleaning, all covered by insurance.  After all the xrays and exam and one hour later, he was told he needed a deep scale cleaning for an extra $171!!!!  He has never missed a 6mos. cleaning in his life and when he declined the extra deep cleaning, they refused to give him a regular teeth cleaning!!!!!  They sent him away!!!!  Is it not a patients choice whether they would like to spend more money on their teeth?  What the heck is going on here????? I think this practice is trying to line their pockets with cash.  They were plain mad that their scheming did not work!  Please go elsewhere!

I was not happy with the bad service and then asked what beer might match my favorite beer and i got a very wrong choice by the staff, then asked to try another beer for $1, wow that's wrong.  Then my friend ordered a simple Sam Adams and it was either bad beer or tapped to a wrong keg (either way still tasted bad).  Not a good showing and wished it could have been better.  I will try back in 6 months and see if they have oiled the process out to be better.  A word of advice, if you have 40 some taps of beer your staff better know them, go look at yard house....

The new owner of a year or so has done what is proper and just!  My ski jackets and paint for lost and his dealing with the problem was perfect. He was professional and prompt and always keep me in the loop.  Never did I think he would screw me and he just stood up and did the right thing.  Refreshing to see someone makes a problem go away instead of get bigger.  By making the fix to the problem right he showed me that this is a good company to deal with. The norm would not have done me right and I'd still have a problem or I'd have to compromise on some way. Thanks for being upstanding and honest, values our world need more of!

VERY SATISIFIED! I took my recently restored 1968 Cutlass to Allstate to fix a transmission leak. Apparently the trans is an odd one - a 2 speed  automatic.  Mitch looked at it and gave tne option of repairing the leak or upgrading to a Turbo 350 3 speed.  Decided to do the up grade and I am so happy.  Price was very fair and it was done on time.  Car runs and shifts like new!  Lots more get up and go too!  They did a great job and even pointed out a couple of issues my restorers missed.  I highly recommend Allstate Transmission.

I have been coming here for a long time - before it became CC's it was Chuy's, one of my favorite places for a casual meal. When Chuy's closed I was pretty bummed out.  I am so glad that Angela and Joyce took over and kept the place going - with pretty much the same recipes!  The food is as good as ever!  Great food, fair prices and a self serve chips and salsa bar.  How can you go wrong?  Highly recommend the 1/2 or 1/4 chicken, although the salad is really goo too.

Not sure why my 12/2013  review was removed. I have had no experience with the after-school or summer program but PVSK is a great school to study karate.  My kids and I went there for years, had fun and enjoyed a lot of success.  Sensei Wall and his staff are all very knowledgeable.  The facilities are good and the atmosphere is friendly.  If MMA is what you want this may not be the school for you.  Sensei Wall teaches traditional karate and all the values that come from learning a martial art. We really had a great experience here.

Hays Cooling is excellent and I will call them when the other system on my house need to be replaced.
UPDATE - 1/1/16 - Manny came out to check the installation of the new unit.  He was great!  He hooked up our load controller on the new unit Hays installed as well as to the old one that was on the house when we bought it.  I will be calling Hays when the old unit dies!

I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO EVERYONE! 

My wife and I went to Bonefish Grill Saturday night.  It was busy but not packed.  Had a reservation anyway.  Here is the positive - seated quickly, Rochelle (Awesome server!) took drink & dinner order and returned quickly with drinks.  Appetizer - Coconut Shrimp - came quickly and was delicious!  Now the night goes to hell!  We, and several other patrons, waited almost an hour for our entrees!  In fact ours was delivered to the wrong table and when this was discovered, picked up and brought to us. Not good!  If not for the fact we had waited so long I would have sent it back. Pasta was overcooked and came in one big clump.  Veggies were OK but very oily.  Fish was good.  MOD came to apologize and really had no excuse for the slow kitchen.  Offered a "free" desert for our inconvience ($5 homemade donuts).  I know they we $5 because they charged us for them!  In fairness they did take them off when I brought this to their attention.

Pretty unlikely we will ever go back.  Kind of spendy and there are lots of choices in our neighborhood.

I am an aging martial artist and the years of abuse have finally caught up with me.  My back and hips have been causing me some painful problems.  I have visited several chiropractors in the valley seeking help.  Dr. Burnett is the only one who has been able to give me long lasting relief.  Her approach is refreshing and effective.  She spends time looking at my whole body and addresses the issues she finds.  And I really like the massage therapy after the chiro session!  She has an excellent and caring staff and I highly recommend Four Peaks Chiropractic.

The food is OK the idea is great but I'm not going to go there anymore with my friends because the cashier is a total bitch. I don't think it is normal for someone to tell a customer "that's the way it works in Qc " followed by "the tip ain't included to the bill " after adding taxes to everything. I was suppose to pay 15 per person. We ended up paying 20 each with taxes then she forced us to separately tip her 4 dollars with HUGE attitude. So we payed 24 dollars. That's a nine dollar difference. Taxes and tip shouldn't be nine dollars extra per person. 

In conclusion, you should pay for the food, not her attitude.

Avoid the bubble tea booth in the food court at all cost. The employees are rude and have screwed up my order every time yet they have refused to fix it. I ordered a Piña Colada bubble tea with bubbles. She makes it hot. The only Piña Colada article in the menu is a slush yet she kept denying it even when I tried to explain to her what a Piña Colada is. It's always a slush. She just gave me some lip and ignored me showing a sign that they don't refund or remake drinks. The bubbles were semi rough and my bf has gotten a very bad stomach ache after drinking my drink instead of me. Customers are always right, as specially when you make a stupid mistake. Never going back there and I would advise you to go to the cocobun in the joint mall. It's cheaper and the employees aren't dumbasses as far as I`m concerned.

If your home warranty company refers you to Aaron Pools for service do yourself a huge favor and ask for someone else for service. 

Someone things that were working just fine all of a sudden don't when they leave. His response "bad luck". When the technician calls back he is rude and talks over you while raising his voice and acts like he was doing us a favor by fixing what he was contracted to do through the warranty company.

Mind you the world series was on as was a Cowboys game. I show up 20 min later and it's not ready. She says oh they are just getting it together for you. It was another 30 min of standing in the lobby until I got my order. All they said was "she should have quoted you a longer time". Um, ya think?

It would be helpful if they had staff who listened...
I clearly said NO guacamole on my order and it was smothered everywhere 
I call them back and she tells me there was no guacamole added to which I asked her to explain the green stufff all over. She says bring them back and they will remake them but won't won't start making them until I give the old ones back. Keep I mind I waited nearly 20 min the first time I was there. 
While waiting for the remake they messed up several other orders. 
She gives me the remade order and the cheese was just thrown on there and not melted at all. I ask her to melt the cheese and she throws the styrofoam container in the microwave. 

Other Los Favs locations I'd recommend all day 
The one on Cooper and Warner never again

We are locals and decided to try Jayde since we love the M Hotel so much and thought for sure it would be great. We were less then impressed. We all started off with the cucumber salad that had been made early in the morning or possible left over from the night before. It was horrible and dried out and bitter.We all remained optimistic about the food we were about to receive but, looking back we should have just left. The tuna was horrible and none of us could eat it. The waiter acted like he had heard that a time or two. Some of us tried more rolls and some of us decided to go the Jadye Specialties. The fried rice at Panda Express is much better, the only item we could all eat was the dumplings. There was 5 of us and we all vowed we would never ever go back. Also, the staff could care less if you enjoyed the food or not.

I didn't apparently get the entire "MOD Experience" (that I've seen people on here complain of) as, I had to leave. I called ahead to ensure that this location had gluten-free pizza. We entered MOD & were not even greeted. We had to engage the employees in a greeting, etc. We then attempted to order 1 regular pizza & 1 gluten-free pizza. The girl who was reluctantly assisting us asked if the g-free pizza was a preference or an allergy. We stated (allergy) at which point she reached in the cooler/freezer to pull out a pre-made g-free crust (she did not change her gloves, & actually took a regular crust off an aluminum pan & put the g-free crust directly on the contaminated aluminum pan). I will NEVER eat @ this establishment & I would recommend that anyone who has to eat g-free to avoid this place.

This is the worst car rental place ever.  The way they do business is terrible.  They lure you in with the lowest price on the travel websites, but once you get to the counter to get your car, it's all about add ons.  The agent tried repeatedly to hard sell us on an upgrade, tacked on a $200 deposit, even though we told him we had insurance to cover the car he still put it on the bill and it was until I pointed it out that he took it off.  So frustrating.  

I should have read these reviews before hand.  In the future, I guarantee I will never use this company again.

We stopped at Peachtree for a glass of wine and appetizers. The place was comfortable. Unfortunately though not only was the bartender cranky but he made us feel like we were a bother to him. Then we order sweet potato chips which were $9. The chips were burnt and was about one cup total. So overpriced and bad quality.  Couldn't recommend this place to anyone.

It is so sad that after loosing their cook, their floor manager, and their customers they are struggling to keep it open. I am predicting that soon they will close it down for good. They cannot survive with substandard food.

Excellent resturant. Great variety of tasty and healthy dishes.
I have been in Chickpeas restaurant in the past 7 months many times both for lunch and dinner. Some times with friends and relatives. We will go back whenever we have the opportunity. The restaurant is clean, very friendly atmosphere, excellent food and prices are very reasonable. Recently, they revised their menu. Excellent selection of tasty foods.
We have been there with freinds and relatives, they love to go back there too; they really have enjoyed it.
This resturant has a great menu, Pizzas, Mediterranean, and Persian dishes, as well as fresh pastries and bread that they bake every few hours. Highly recommended.

This has been the worst experience ever I went in for a nose piercing and a couple days later the hole was closing because they put in the wrong size and didn't account for the swelling. So I asked if they could replace it they told me to take an advil and see if that helps......really? So I tell them that I want a bigger stud so that my hole wouldn't close back up. So one of the tatoo artist clearly annoyed said they would do it. I should have walked out then. I watched as they went into a tub of studs, then he began to file it down, during that time the jewlery fell on the ground a couple times. When he put the piercing in he was rough and very rude. He put a very long bar that stick out my nose. It has been 3 week and it is still very sore and not very nice to look at. I am going to a different shop tomorrow so that they can hopefully correct the issue. Please please do not go to this place.

Clean and spacious arrangement, however, customer service is VERY poor here. Was promised pant alternations would be done by certain time but when called they were still working on them. Was leaving on extended trip and wanted to have the pants so rushed in a few hours later to pick up. Since this was now very close to my departure, I was in a huge hurry. Had already paid so literally just needed to be handed my pants and on my way. However, with two guys working both were busy and did not even acknowledge my presence as  I stood there and circled around for 10 minutes. Not a peep. No "will be right with you" or anything. Finally grabbed one guy off of phone and got my pants and was out of there. But after this experience I would NEVER shop at Jos A Bank's again. I'm used to "Nordstrom" (and independent clothier) customer service. And this was far, far from it. Very unprofessional!

Food with no taste. My suggestion to the chef: at least use a little salt next time!

All the dishes I sampled (from other family members) were really very bland. I think they may be counting on the fact you are drunk by the time your meal arrives. Nice beer though... if you are planning to go, just drink as much as you can and try to get drunk before your meal arrives... that way you wont notice

These are by far the worst repairs I have ever had. First, they damaged my handbrake on my first encounter. When I brought it in the "repair" that they attempted lasted about a day or so. On bringing in my car for the third time, they replaced the whole handbrake mechanism (charged be $600+) and now while I drive my car there is a loud banging noise on each revolution of my wheels and high resistance to any acceleration I apply. I stopped going here! I dont even need a free repair from these guys any more

Went for brunch on a sunday at 11am.  The place was pretty busy, but our group of 4 only had to wait about 10 minutes and we were given a spot at the bar.  Love the decor and the fact that none of their coffee mugs match.  Our food was good, service was great and we had a good time.  I don't understand the complaints about parking- we found a spot down the street.  Heaven forbid you have to walk an extra 50 feet.  We loved it and will be back!

The food is delicious.  Service... eh.  My parents had made a reservation for us (on a Wednesday night) and we were sat at a high-top bar table?  The dining area was wide open, so my mom wasn't exactly ecstatic about it. The staff can be a bit rude (stuck up).  

At our table we had basil rolls, fried wontons, red curry duck, basil chicken, volcano shrimp and the Pad Thai.  The Pad Thai was by far my favorite, we will come back simply for that dish.  We also had a pear martini which was delicious and unique.  Overall our dinner was great, but the "experience" not so much.

We went last night finally after craving some barbeque for weeks.  Overall, our experience was awesome.  We had an awesome server, Cliff, who gave us his suggestions and was pretty entertaining.  We took Cliff's suggestion and got the Combo platter since we were newbs.  We ordered the brisket, ribs and doubled up on the pork bbq.  For our sides we got mac n cheese and fries.  Everything was really great.  The ribs were probably our least favorite, but they still tasted great.. just not as tender as we were hoping!  Pretty good beer selection and great service.  We'll be back!

Salsa was delicious. Cheese dip was really good too. I had the shredded chicken tacos which were pretty tasty and my boyfriend had the chicken quesadilla which he gobbled up (it was also massive).  Only negative is that it is a bit pricy for mexican food-but it was delicious with large portions (and fresh food) so it didn't bother us too much!

I came here yesterday for my first time after wanting to try it out for months. The decor is too die for, so adorable! 

We got seated right away, I would of preferred the patio, but since it was Valentines Day I was happy we got seated at all without a wait. Our cute and bubbly comes in to greet us and we immediately ask to order the guacamole and she apologizes and says they are out and she should mention they're also out of flour tortillas?! Um, what? Mexican restaurant that doesn't have guac... you would think that would be simple to remake. But, of course maybe they didn't think they'd as busy this weekend being Valentines day and all. 

The great thing is they have happy hour all day on Sundays and the drinks were amazing and delicious and pretty and anything else you can think of. The food on the other hand was nothing spectacular. I will definitely be back to give them another try when they might be more prepared and not so busy. The place was too cute and I've heard too many great things to not try them out again.

As I was pulling out of my drive way I noticed my passenger rear tire was flat. After stopping by QT to put air in, I noticed a massive nail... sure enough just my luck. This was the third time the same tire has had a nail in. So I look it to Discount and to my surprise there was no wait, they helped me right away. Quick and easy process and the best part it was free. They gave me a whole brand new tire since the hole wasn't repairable. I don't know why it was free, I never bought any warranty. I am assuming the tires themselves have a warranty (the tire was less than a year old). I will never buy my tires from anywhere else ever again. I am a customer for life!

I came right when they opened at 11am. There was 2 people already in line in front of me. The sweetest lady ever greeted me and asked if I came in from the news (I guess they had a segment earlier this morning). I explained I work close by and had been wanting to try the place out. I ordered my food, which took way too long for my liking. I could definitely tell Ms.Dee normally doesn't do the ordering/ringing up. Then sit and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait for my food. 45 minutes later I receive my food, and they are missing 1 item... so I wait some more. At last, my order is ready! Then I go to pay after I get my food (which is the strangest thing) they would of let me walk out if I hadn't mentioned I never paid yet. Great food, great people, but they need a lot more help in the back. 1 person to cook and 1 person to take orders obviously isn't cutting it. The people ahead of me actually walked out without getting their food. I mean a 45 minute wait when I was the 3rd person in line for a baked potato seems a little strange to me.

So I am now engaged and my ring is absolutely gorgeous! The only reason for 4 stars is that my boyfriend mentioned he had a bit of a mix up while dealing with Shane Co. 

We went in together to pick out the ring and at that time he put a deposit down to hold the diamond that we were looking at (I was not aware of this as he went back at a later time). At that point it was explained to him that the ring would be ready in about a month. Well he said a month went by and still no word from Shane Co. He decided to call them to get a status on the ring. He spoke with them and they said they hadn't even started making it yet and that he needs to pay in full before the make the ring. He immediately is a little irritated as a whole month was wasted and he put a deposit down. I would assume he would of gotten some communication or follow up in regards to the deposit and when he would like the ring. My fiance paid in full for the remaining balance and at this point we are another month out before he gets the ring.

 I'm not sure if it was misunderstanding or if my fiance was told wrong information. Either way, it was not an ideal situation to be in.

This is my usual nail spot. For the most part they are decent. I go every 2 weeks to get a gel mani and never complained before. I went this past Sunday and some young guy who I always see there did my nails. Horrible, he did not get close to the cuticle at all. He was literally on his cell phone the entire time checking the football games because he said he was gambling on the games. Maybe you should of paid more attention to your client and how crappy of a job you did. If I go back and that's a big if, I will wait for someone else before I let this kid do my nails again.

They have great color selections for gel, place is pretty outdated. The employees and owners are very nice and remember me from all those years ago. They do great work and put the Polish close to the cuticle, which is rare to find.

The Arriba Mexican Grill off Bell Road is fantasic, but this location is closer to home so I tried it out.

We sat in the bar area and weren't greeted for about 15-20mins. No big deal, we order our drinks and that takes about another 15 mins to arrive. The server brings drinks to the table next to us and drops the entire tray of drinks and the lady behind me... I'm not talking a little water. The poor lady is covered in drinks. The server immediately apologies and runs off leaving the spilled drinks all over the floor and table. I kid you not that spilled mess sat on the floor for 30 mins before ANYONE came over. No manager came to apologize to the lady right away and all the did was give her a free appetizer! Terrible customer service, the manager addressed the lady as "the one who got drinks spilled on". How about you learn some manners, sir! 

Anyways, after 50 minutes of sitting there we finally see our server again to take our order. The food came and what do you... it's super crappy tasting! I'll take my $50 for 2 people and go else where... like the Bell Rd location. This place sucks, so bad.

I love this place. I was a person that only went every once in a while to buy trades and free comic book day (always spent money). As of march I have been going every Wednesday when the new books come out, I sometimes go a second time in a week.  I can say when I wasn't a regular I was always treated as if I was one.  I know people love Kenmore comics, but I will stick with this as my shop of choice.

Went there for lunch for my birthday and i was not impressed at all.  I ordered a beer & they were out off it and i. Ordered  a vodka & tonic which wasn't bad but i saw our drinks just sitting at the bar for way to long. I ordered the prime rib dip.. The waitress then came over and said they were out of the bread for the sandwich and ask if  they could put it on a hamburger bun; the food was good. But how do you run out of stuff in the middle of the week? My brother ordered another beer and that like our drinks before just sat at the bar. After we said we didn't want desert they just brought the bill didn't even ask if I wanted another drink. The all around service needs  major improvement

The may have changed the name, but when you walk it makes you think you are in a Borders.  I have shopped there a few times, the price is about the same as it competitors.  I would not go there if you are looking to purchase movies or TV shows, they are one of the highest price retailers. Customer Service needs some improvement, I should not get an attitude when I can't find an item and I ask to see if it can be ordered. The only way I will stop in this store is if I need something and I'm on that side of town.

I saw they had breakfast, so i decided to stop one morning, the food was average nothing out of this world. The Service at breakfast was HORRIBLE, the server offered more coffee to those who had it, but had to ask for more water a few times before i got it.  told the manager and he did not seem to care.

A few years ago, i would have told people this is the place to go for repairs or anything for you computer. but after the last time i was there they could for get it. i went to take my computer over there to be fixed, then when i went to pick it up, i saw the were charging me an extra $30.00. I asked what this was for and he told me the last time i was in the payment got returned ( i had not been there in over a year). I asked if i could see proof, i was told no. But suddenly after i said i would call the BBB, they showed me the proof. it was not one of my payment and it was not for a computer. the gave me a hard time again to take off the $30.00 charge.

I am with my basketball team and we go to this Olive Garden. The waitress Melissa sits us down and tells us our meal plan. She follows that up with "my manager was nice enough to let you guys have soft drinks, so don't suck them down because I will not be refilling them quickly." I ordered Peach Bellini Tea and didn't receive a gosh darn peach. Salad was good though. 2 stars and that's generous.

I paid 40% and gave them 5 months lead time to completely remodel my only bathroom, which is 5' by 12'. Completion was to be in 2 1/2 weeks max. After initial demolition, work stopped for 7 work days. 2 days of work and then another stop. Completion after 5 1/2 weeks. Promised lock box was a rock next to the front door. Follow up took over one year. My bathroom is lovely, but not worth the money, time, inconvenience and anxiety over security. Go elsewhere.

Surprised to see this place rated 4 stars on Yelp. I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening for a quick bite and we found our meal extremely substandard.

The draft beer and wine lists were solid and the cocktails were pretty good, so no complaints there. The food menu was focused, but one lingering question hovered over us while we browsed it:

Where the hell is the bacon?

For a restaurant with pork-themed fare, there were disappointingly few dishes that contained bacon. Plenty of pâté, tenderloin and belly but no bacon. It just seemed weird.

The cheese plate was very tasty and reasonably priced - $10 for three cheeses, toast points/crackers and small samples of red wine poached pears and roasted beets. The beets were the only thing out of place on the plate, and although this was the high point of the meal, it's hard to give Black Pig credit for something extremely difficult to screw up.

For the entree, I ordered the croque monsieur ($13) and my girlfriend ordered the pork tenderloin ($19). My sandwich arrived and was ENORMOUS. The thing was slightly larger than my face and came with a mountain of "pommes frites" (Black Pig's terminology). It looked like something Adam Richman should tackle on a Man Versus Food challenge.

The huge portion size to price ratio couldn't save the uninspiring flavors. The fries were ridiculously salty and I didn't even bother taking the sandwich home despite leaving about 3/4 of it on the plate. 

Despite costing $6 more, the pork tenderloin dish was much smaller and tasted as bland as it looked - plenty of brown and green on the plate but very little flavor. The pork was juicy at least, so not a total loss.

Overall it was an extremely disappointing experience. The food couldn't live up to the menu, which overhypes its descriptions with meaningless adjectives - "free range" toad-in-a-hole, "nettled" risotto.

We'll probably come back for drinks, but my advice is skip the food.

I've been coming to Quintana's to get my hair cut for over three years now. Jessica has been my stylist for the majority of that time, and every trim she's given me has been flawless. I always leave a happy customer. She's a great conversationalist, extremely knowledgeable when it comes to styling and always has great product recommendations for me.

The salon's other services are extremely high quality - the deep tissue and hot stone massages are fantastic, and on the rare occasion I'm able to, I enjoy a nice pedicure every now and then. Quintana's offerings are second to none.

Everyone there is warm, inviting and friendly. I can't recommend this establishment any higher.

After reading these reviews I had zero hope when I called about annual fees being charged to my account three months after sign up - annual fees that I was told would be charged a year after I had my membership (Ya know 'cause that's what "annually" means).

However, I called the customer service line (after calling the gym and being told they couldn't help) and talked to "Amber" , explaining the above. She said she'd need time to "request and review my file", and advised me she'd call back with details. She didn't.

I followed up a few days later, and she consented that she'd reverse the annual fees charged to both my account, and my girlfriend's. She didn't.

I called back the following week, and spoke with "Linda" who informed me Amber was out sick, and she'd be reviewing my file. I politely stopped her there, and told her Amber had already told me to expect a refund. She again stated she'd have to research my file (Incidentally, what sort of "file" is there? I mean we are talking about a 1 sheet gym contract, right?).

At any rate, she did call me back that afternoon and told me the refund had been processed. On 5/14, roughly 2 weeks later and 5 phone calls later it was resolved.

Bottom line, it was too much of a hassle. If it wasn't for the fact that they reversed the annual fees, and that I can walk to this gym, they'd be at 1 star instead of 3.

Once upon a time I got a flat on a 100°+ July day. I called USAA and thought I had a towing company lined up but alas, when I called them they said they didn't even cover the area I was in. 
   But then a the clouds parted and a miracle was bestowed upon me. That miracle was USAA reassigning the job to Central Towing.
   In twenty minutes less than what USAA had told me, my truck driver Fransisco showed up, gave me an ice cold water and told me to have a seat in the air conditioned cab of his truck while he took care of my car. 
  If he hadn't come along when he did, I could've died- well maybe that's a bit dramatic, but he still did a damn good job!

I toured the business on 5/23/2015 with my girlfriend and a friend. It was on a whim as we had a Groupon.

I'd have to say that the tour was informative, and gave perspective of how a small business was run (if you've been on any of the big distillery tours like Jack Daniels you'll notice several distinct differences). The tour was given by one employee while the owner waited at the bar until we were done to provide samples.  While giving the tour to a group of maybe sixteen people, the employee encouraged us to ask questions and kept the air of the tour light while joking throughout. As an added bonus some of the jokes were even funny! Kidding aside, levity was definitely there, without feeling forced or bordering on the lame. 

Once we got through the informational portion, we all bellied up to the bar and got ready for our samples. Jason, the owner greeted every person, asked their name and shook hands. Which I thought was classy, and was certainly a throwback to a bygone era of how business was done. 

Jason talked through the history of each spirit (Moonshine, Bourbon, Gin) and connected us to how they came into being as well as how he decided upon their names. In doing so, he also informed us about how he had gotten into the business to begin with. Personally, I found this portion extremely relatable and inspiring, though I won't spill it here, and would advise you to visit the business on your own to hear the tale.

As far as the booze, I'm not a Gin fan in any form, but otherwise the Bourbon and the Moonshine were excellent. 

Overall, a great way to spend an hour, particularly if you have friends or relatives in town, or to simply support an Arizona small business doing quality work!

Average at best. Been here twice, twice got chewy bulgogi that tasted old. Grey and chewy and too sweet.

Sushi is terrible. 

Avoid. 

If you want sushi, go elsewhere. Like anywhere else.

If you want Korean BBQ, go to Cafe Ga Hyang.

Never again.

As good as it gets. I've never had mole this good. Ever. 

The Tamal Oaxacaeno is absurd. The Tlayudas are unreal. 

Someone pinch me, I'm dreaming. 

Next time someone tries to tell you that San Diego has better Mexican food than Phoenix, remind them that La 15 y Salsas exists, and end the argument. 

As good a meal as you'll ever eat.

Came in at 10:45 on a Tuesday right before close and split the chicken club and a house salad with my wife. 

Sandwich was perfect. Absolutely killer. Crisp bacon, grilled chicken was dead on, ripe tomato, warm pretzel roll. so so good. 

Salad was great too, attention to detail... fine dice on the cukes, nice garlicky ranch, simple and great. 

We'll be back.

No stars for my visit today if I could, I go in to buy 4 items use the self check out and the machine is out of receipt paper she refills the machine and requires a manager to access the receipts on the machine. I got my items in 5 minutes. She called over a manager named Manny he takes 5 mins to come by looks at me ask if I need a receipt. Leaves I'm standing there for over 30 mins expecting him to come back with my receipt to find out he's helping everyone else because he forgot. I understand you have a whole store to run but this is ridiculous. The manager himself does not even know how to pull up the receipt. The whole ordeal took an hour and a half. Very upsetting.

Dim sum here is by far the least interesting in town and there's no cart service - you have to order off of a small pile of menus... so no points for experience. The food ranges from bad (very greasy fried squid that comes off as freezer-grade fish and chips), to bland (most dumplings), to ok (crab claw with shrimp). Also, prices are about 20% higher than the excellent Kam Fung and the reliable Ruby Rouge (it's right next door, so... why are you here?). Lacklustre service seals the deal. Pass.

Check it out.Simple Gourmet has Lenten Specials only offered on Fridays. I had the Veggie Tuscan which substitutes homemade hummus for chicken with greens, red peppers an balsamic dressing on a ciabatta bun. She also has Lobster Bisque but it was sold out when I got there. Finally, she has Italian Motz Salad. Unbelievable good and a great break from fish.

We just moved to Mesa and were happy to hear about this place. We love Mexican food.  We were looking forward to a green chile burro enchilada style.  The meat in the burrito tasted like canned meat and was gravy like.  The rice and beans tasted like canned food too.  Not authentic at all.  We did not finish our food but ate a lot of chips and salsa which weren't bad.  Finished our drinks and left.   I am not sure why everyone raves about this place..... They must not know good mexican food.  We won't be back.

Visited this restaurant a few weeks ago and tasted a variety of their kabob plate combos. My family and I enjoyed their baby lamb chops and the boneless chicken thighs the most - moist, delicious and large servings! (we also tried the chaplee, chicken breast kabob and shish kabob). Again, the combos offered are of very good value...good amount of meat, a large piece of naan (which was a little bland and not as soft as the Indian naan we're used to) and good serving of fresh salad with every combo. 

The people working there were also very nice, welcoming and helpful. Will return and try the tandoori chicken they also offer. Note: their website mistakenly says they open at 12pm everyday, but when we arrived on Sunday, they did not open until 1pm!

Tonight my husband and I visited Cleveland Tiffin and we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience.  Before I get into sharing about the food, I must express how friendly and personable Anup and everyone at Tiffin were.  While waiting for our food, Anup shared fascinating information about Tiffin Carriers in India.  I will continue to learn more about this process on my own.

     Now on to the dinner,  I am vegan so I ordered the Palak Paneer and traded out the paneer for tofu extra spicy.  I also ordered Vegetable Biryani extra spicy.   This was a delicious meal.  The spinach and tofu was so flavorful and fresh and the Biryani was aromatic and addictive.  My husband orders the Chicken Tika Masla.  He also enjoyed his dish as well.  The portions are large so I have a lot of food left over to eat.  All dishes are made to order...like a homemade meal.  With that in mind, prepare to order a couple of hours before you plan to eat dinner.  It is definitely worth the wait.

I had such a great evening at M Italian. Our waitress was phenomenal! She was prompt, funny and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was delicious I ordered the Wedding soup, Italian meatball and mushroom pizza from the Happy Hour Menu. The meal was DELICIOUS! The Wedding soup was created from a family recipe and it was so flavorful, it warmed the soul. The Italian meatballs were moist and tender. The tomato sauce and cheese that topped this dish raised the flavors of a simple meatball; to meatball perfection in a dish...I will order this again! The pizza was cooked well and made with quality ingredients. The food portions were generous. I was able to take food home to eat for lunch the next day. 

     At the conclusion of my meal, the manager stopped by our table to ask about our evening. He was a pleasure to meet. After talking with our party of 4, he sent over a sample drink for our party to try. Of course, it was DELICIOUS! Needless to say, I will be a regular patron at M Italian. I will update my comment after my next visit to include the names of the wonderful people who made my evening special.

I agree since the name change prices have gone up, service gone down. THis is right next to my work and used to be bumping for lunch not anymore. Would have the wife meet me with our kids for lunch under kids eat free was perfect for my little ones and we loved the place.  UNDER NEW NAME...  meat chix wieners should be slow,slower,closed.  at this rate  the owners should rethink the name franchise break.

The pharmacist at this Walgreens is extremely rude and unprofessional. She was trying to play doctor and she is not a doctor she is a fucking pharmacist.  This women had the audacity to question my family's intent and our doctors education. We have been loyal customers of Walgreens for 15 YEARS!!! I understand their policies and we weren't asking them for special treatment. We were merely asking if it would be possible to get a certain prescription on a certain day because of the holidays. She questions our doctors integrity who has also been our family doctor for 15 years! We usually use a different Walgreens and the reason we were using this location was because the other one didn't have our prescription in stock so they referred us to them. Our other Walgreens knows us by name and they are all very sweet. This pharmacist then begins to insult the other location to us (the CUSTOMER). She also says that our doctor who has been prescribing the same thing for the 15 years is wrong and he shouldn't be prescribing that to us. She said that wouldn't fill our prescription. Feeling so insulted we then proceeded to call the corporate office and they said they would have someone call us that was in our district. They still have not returned our call. Overall i think that this pharmacist should have some repercussions for her attempt to "play god".

I like to make sure a store has something before I make the effort to go down there. I check the the website for what I need and make sure I check the boxes for in store at  this location. I do this all the time and they have it, but every time I go to this location it's never there so I just wasted my time. The shelves are never stocked and everything is just laying around. Terrible service. Always only like 4 registers open out of 30 registers and the lines are so long even in the 20 or less line. It takes just as long to get through the 20 or less as it does the normal lines.

We where her for a work convention. Check in on a Wednesday night for a two night stay.  The hotel offered us a great upgrade to our room for a small fee. We stay in in one of the 900 sq foot suits. The room was  spacious and comfortable. The bathroom is clean. The only complaint I have is I felt that the carpet was gross. 

 The first morning we ate at the buffet. The food was mediocre at best. I have to say we left a little hungry.

I have to say that Bellair Laser Clinic is by far the best I've ever been to!!  

First impression - the clinic is spectacular.  The location is convenient (a few steps away from the subway), the design is very chic and the place is beyond clean.  They greet you so warmly and they have such positive energy.  

The services I had done were underarm laser, microdermabrasion and now going for fraxel.  I've inquired about several products but never felt pressured to buy them.  They gave me samples to take home to try before I committed to a bigger bottle.  Every single product I bought, I LOVED.  

Bellair Laser truly is an amazing place and would recommend anybody to try it out.  You will not be disappointed.  

Good job to their team & management for such amazing experiences and professional advice.  You have a life long customer!!

Unprofessional! We had a 10:45 flight, the shuttle company told us to be ready for pick up at 8:15. We were waiting in the designated spot outside of our hotel until 8:35 for the shuttle to arrive. It finally did, and took until 8:40 for us to leave. Originally, the shuttle's route was New Orleans to MGM Grand, but, upon calling, it was revealed that they had stopped at other hotels along the way. Irritating if you have to catch a flight!!

Perfect! There's enough staff to manage having everyone enter the theatre, and the seating isn't in a difficult arrangement. 

Before you enter, there's a bar. They serve cocktails and some soft drinks (Pepsi, Sprite). Their smallest size is 12oz. They also serve small and large popcorn, which was really good. 

The actual show was great as well. There's so much going on, starting from when you enter- employees are all dressed up. In the stage, there's a fake blast of fire frequently. 

The show began exactly on time and was about an hour and a half. The graphics, light, sound, and technology were crazy!! Enjoyed the show very much.

Today is the last time I will ever order steak and eggs at the 5 & Diner.  This is the third time in a row where the steak just sucked.  Not even eatable.  The server (Carlos) is nice and does what he can but it's not enough.  Carlos told me he tells his boss but nothing changes.  Well now I'm telling whoever runs that place that your breakfast steak is not worth serving let along to pay $12 for it.  Unfortunately you will never have a chance to get me back even if you solve the problem.

It's way over priced for what you get.  The burgers are good the frys are soggy and undercooked and they're not shoe-string like advertised.  You can go to Hamburger Works and the best burger in Phoenix.  You can get a "great big one" with everything including a large 1/2 pound of fresh beef for much less than 5 guys charges.  I also didn't like having to buy frys for 2 for $3.00.  A small burger, frys and a drink cost almost $13.  I tried it once but I won't go back.

Terrible.  Don't waste your time or money.  They only have one waiter to handle the entire place and he is so scripted he doesn't make any connection to the customers.  He's just working for tips.  The food is not to my liking the marinara sauce is way too sweet for my taste.  It's also expensive for what you get.  I will never go back to that place.  I'll go back to the Avanti.   Location is not great but the food and service is so far above this place it's not even a consideration.

The Ritz Brothers (Pat and Joe) are the best.  Patrick is a Master Mechanic and Joe is an organized Manager who cares about customers and getting the job done right.  They are honest and reasonable but above all, there is nothing these guys can't fix.  Fix it right and fix it the first time.  I'm impressed with how many vehicles are there in their shop, all high end vehicles or antique, they seem to do it all.  I was there today and again impressed with the line up of expensive vehicles for service or repair.  If  you want it done right and don't want to get gouged, take your car to Sports and Collectors Car Center.  You'll thank me later for this recommendation and you'll never go to a dealer again.

These guys are the best of the best.  Their custom work is truly amazing.  They installed the latest Pioneer 5100 NEX in my 2003 Mercedes SL500.  There were no acceptable installation kits available so they had to hand make the mounting hardware and bezel plate for my car.  I had some initial concerns about how it would turn out because I'm very particular and the stereo "head unit" is the centerpiece of the dashboard.  When I went to pick up the car, I was blown away by how good it looked and what a great job they did.  It looks like a factory installation.  
My car now has the most modern technology available in stereo equipment including satellite radio, DVD, CD, Blue Tooth, Apple Car Play, touch screen, Navigation and best of all, sending and receiving texts by voice.... hands free.  
I am 100% satisfied with the installation, the way I was treated, and the quality of the equipment and service that Sun Valley provided.  The same people have worked there for many years and they are very very good at what they do.  I would never even consider going anywhere else.

We had the Basel Duck and it was not bad, it was awful.  I complained but the response was it wasn't their fault.  They refused to make any concessions.  We were charged almost $40 and we didn't eat the duck because it sucked.  Be aware.  There people take no responsibility for serving a bad meal  I will never go back to this place.

I Went in for a defibrillator implant on 4-3-17.  Every one of the people I came in contact with were 4 or 5 star people except one.  He was my night nurse and his name is Dave.  I was on the 6th floor, room #7 of Saint Joseph's Hospital.  The nurse shift change is at 7:30 pm so there was a meeting of Nurse leaving, me and nurse coming on duty ... that would be Dave.  We went over all my meds and that I was also due pain medication at 8 pm (now 7:40).  It was also discussed that my Doctor ordered an IV fed antibiotic also to drip during the night.  I called for Dave at 8:30 and asked about my medication which were due at 8 pm.  He said he was busy but would get to me soon.  At 9 pm I called Dave again who informed me that I would not be getting the pain medication because I had not specifically requested it at 8 pm. He also informed me that he decided not to do the  antibiotic drip.  I told him that I wanted both medications or I would "unhook myself" and go to a different hospital.  I told him I didn't feel safe with him and that I would be submitting a formal complaint in the morning.  That seemed to change his attitude and He finally agreed and gave me the meds sometime after 10 pm.  Dave avoided me most of the rest of the night.  Next morning I asked to speak with Dave's supervisor.  Someone came in who didn't really seem concerned (like this happens all the time).  While she was there my doctor came in for a routine checkup on my condition.  I told him what happened the night before and he immediately asked for the floor manager to come down and speak with me and take a report.  The Manager said she would be right down.  This was at 6:30 am and in spite of my reminders, the floor manager never did show up or contact me.  I think Dave is dangerous.  I stayed awake all that night because I was afraid of what he might do.  Dave needs to be identified and prevented from being around sick people.

Made the mistake of leaving a glowing review a few weeks ago when I was actually treated like a person. Drinks are cheap - expect nothing more, unless you enjoy Jekyll/Hyde personal attacks from the unhinged bartender, regardless of how much you overtip. Oh, and if you dare to leave for a few minutes, he WILL throw out your pitcher. Just go to the Crown and Tiger next door - drinks are even cheaper, it's not in a dank basement, and the servers are efficient AND pleasant.

Priority Pools and Ron Rudy were referred to me by my brother-in-law when I had my pool built last summer.  Their service is exemplary! Any time I've had any problems or pool issues (from low water line to a murky pool), they send some one over right away and it is fixed immediately.  Very professional, super nice, and they know their stuff.  I cannot recommend Ron, and his entire crew highly enough.

I'd say the baking was great except you have to endure the wrath of the owner.  She clearly couldn't give a monkey's about customer service.  I see on the website it's a artist baker.  Whatever get over yourself.  I live around the corner and will never darken the door of this 'artistic bakery' again.

I was so nervous! This was our first home build so we were very overwhelmed with trying to design our backyard.  I did a ton of research and talking to people about the best pool company in our area.  Hands down, Presidential was the top recommendation.  We met with John at the Gilbert location and he was very patient with us.  We had an idea on our pool design but had no idea at all on costs.  We explained this and he patiently designed our pool and all the bells and whistles.  Obviously it came back way over what we could afford.  But John didn't give us any attitude at all.  We were even in his office right before they were closing and he didn't shoo us out the door.  We ended up taking the quote home and sitting on it for a month.  When we finally came back, John was eager to help us redesign something that we could be proud of.  And we did!!

When our project kicked off, our project manager, David, and John met with us at home and walked us through the entire process.  They even had this cool little website where we could track dates and milestones.  Once it got started, it went very quickly!  Our only delays were because of the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.. and the rain.. oh the rain).  And of course, I had soooo many questions.  David was always very responsive and easy to contact.  

At the end of our project, we scheduled an appointment with Jason and he walked us through the phone app to control our pool (yep, there's an app for that) and all the controls on our pool system.  He went step by step on the chemicals needed to keep our pool balanced.  After a week of owning our pool, I feel very comfortable being able to maintain our pool myself because of all the information Jason provided us.

I purchased 3 fans from Clark about a month ago. There was definitely no pressure to purchase anything that day. For the fans I selected, I even had the option to have him install the fan speed controls at my wall switch or use the remote, with no additional charge for parts or installation. On install day, his guy showed up at 9am sharp, installed all 3 fans, and was outta there. 
Though Clark's fans were a bit higher in price, when I add on the install charge and headache to find someone else to put them in, it would have cost me much more. I'm going back today to buy 4 more fans.

In CA, we had a whole house filter that we liked. We called that same company when we moved out to AZ and somehow their price was over double. Nope! So I found a recommendation for this company on a local FB page. Sunday night at 10pm, I sent an FB message to Hunter with Mountain Fresh Water Systems. He replied right away and we scheduled an appointment with him for Monday afternoon. Hunter is very knowledgable, answered all of my millions of questions, and was not at all pushy. We decided on both the R/O and water softener systems that were installed on Tuesday. Within 48 hours, from first contact to install and I'm a happy camper with fresh clean water! A much better system at half the cost of the other guy!

By far the best car buying experience!  I was looking for a used Ford Explorer.  For three days, I was online looking at car dealers from all over Phoenix.  I came across one at Chapman BMW and left a message for JEFF ORENSTEIN.  He returned my call within twenty minutes, apologizing for having taken so long to call me back.  I told him I was interested in the Explorer.  He gave me the best price over the phone, which was much less than the other dealers had listed (including Craigslist), without having to haggle.  When I called him back after talking with my husband, Jeff had already inspected the vehicle, identified items he was going to get fixed before we came in to sign the paperwork.  We made an appointment for after work the next day and within an hour and a half, we were driving away.  I wish buying a TV was this easy!!

Placed our pick-up order online last night for My House chinese restaurant. Went over 10 mins later.. 45 min wait for food. So had a glass of wine at Frys while we waited :) "glass half full"

While we were there, the (young) owner came out.. stressed as all get out.. about having to close again at 6:30. He hasn't slept in 2 days and he's super worried about food quality and customer service.. people have been commenting about his restaurant on Facebook so more people have been coming out.. he's been open for 6 days.. Let's say you've been working on a job for 6 days and your boss tells you that you suck at your job, do you quit and give up? No way!!!!  

If you happen to be hangry today, please choose a different day to try these guys out.. you won't be disappointed!

I'm so glad I went into a corporate store. I stopped at the tmobile closest to me and the guy said "well we can do everything a corporate store can do"........ well not really buddy since you sent me on my way to deal with it myself
At this store, I explained to Alondra that I purchased the iPhone 8 from T-Mobile's website and realized I should have ordered the Plus with the larger screen for my aging eyes. She was on it right away! She called tmobile and confirmed that I could ship back the 8 and get refunded the amount I paid online. She got a return shipping label for me (even printed it). And had the iPhone 8 Plus in the silver that I wanted. Got my new phone running with the application of the protection screen and sent me on my happy way!! 
I realize any store could have done this but the key is making a customer FEEL like you're helping them solve their problem. Kudos to this store that figured it out!

I'm glad I didn't read these reviews before we drove down to the store. We went in looking for a dining set.  Jett took the time to show us all his options.  But after I showed him a picture of what we were looking for, he didn't blow us off.  Instead, he told us about a few furniture stores in the area that carry that manufacture line.  Pretty cool.
So we asked him about sectionals for a media room.  He sold us on one that had all power seats, easy-to-clean leather-like fabric, and then explained the included 5 year warranty.  We asked him about the deal they had at the time where you spend a certain amount and you get a TV for free.  But instead of just letting us spend the money, he suggested that if we didn't really need the extra furniture, just go with the sectional.  
Last night, as promised, they called to let me know the time they were going to deliver the sectional (10:30-2:30 window).  Today, they showed up at 11:30, set it all up, and explained how to take them apart.
What I really liked about the experience is how Jett had a ton of information, from furniture  manufactures to colors that promote warmth and coziness.  He is definitely an expert.

I have been going to Dr. Terkonda for many years for fillers, Botox, and some "preventative maintenance".  He is highly skilled and personable.  He shows excellent judgement and I trust him completely.  I have strayed for Botox specials (while he's competitive, there's something about a Living Social deal).  I am so much happier when I return to him.  He does beautiful work and ultimately, where your face is involved....that's key!

I can't attest to the beer, but everything else about this place was pretty abysmal.

Atmosphere/ambiance - weird. Stage still there from jazz bar and it's just taking up space and awkward. Also feels like a cafeteria. Tables are very spread out and there's just not much to the whole space.

Food - decent, but definitely not worth the price. We had the calamari appetizer, a salad, 2 kids meals and some beer and paid $52.

Service - waiter was very attentive and nice, but scattered. He forgot our main meal and then actually offered to take the item off our bill. Well, yeah. You think?

Our family loves Seville Family Dentistry. Both doctors are patient, thorough, and have hired an amazing staff of hygienists. Our whole family goes here now, but we just recently started bringing the kids as well. We had been taking them to Timber Falls Pediatric Dentistry for over 5 years and my kids teeth were horrendous. I thought it was just genetics and we had to live with it, but I eventually started to wonder if maybe the team there wasn't all that great. The minute we brought the kids to Seville Family Dentistry, I knew I was right. The hygienist explained what we could do to combat what was going on with my son's teeth and she was able to get them looking the best they'd looked in years. Plus, my husband had been going to Val Vista Dentistry and I convinced him to move. When he did, the team at Seville Family contacted Val Vista for my husband's records to find out that they couldn't provide a full set of x-rays because they never actually took any even though they claimed them on insurance. So it's refreshing to be able to find dentists who are honest and looking out for our best interests.

I like the idea and it's kind of fun since it's a little different, but I definitely spent an arm and half a leg for it. 2 kids + 1 adult and $50 later... Also, the servers were super friendly, but my first server (there were several) got 2 things on my order wrong. I would let one mistake slide, but 2 is too many. Also, the ordering method is a little archaic. It would be awesome if they had mobile devices at each table so you could just order that way instead of hand-writing your own order on a piece of paper. It's not that difficult but sometimes it takes time for your server to notice your paper order standing there. Overall experience was fun, but it wouldn't be something I do a lot.

Had an appointment at SimonMed today. I walked in and of course the waiting room was packed with about 15 people waiting. I filled out my paperwork and gave it to the person at the desk with my insurance card. 20 minutes later they still hadn't called my name to return my card even though they'd taken about 4 other people who came in after me. I checked with the desk and the lady said someone was processing me. So I waited another 20 minutes and went back to the desk. I asked if they thought they might get to me soon since I had somewhere I needed to be in 20 minutes. The lady said they were running at a 40 minute wait time (instead of their usual 25 which is already ridiculous) and there were also 3 people ahead of me. I'd already been there 40 minutes so I was done. I told her I would just reschedule and come back if she could just return my insurance card. But guess what they couldn't find? After she spent 5 minutes looking for my card and asking other employees if they'd seen it, I told her to forget it and left. Total waste of time and a frustrating experience.

I've gotten good pedicures at White Lotus and since I had been looking for a new hair stylist and with all the great reviews on Yelp, I thought I'd finally try them for hair.
I went to see Beth and told her that I was looking for a slightly different style since I was bored with what I'd been doing for so long. Unfortunately, I'm not really sure what kind of style she gave me. It ended up looking very choppy in the back - two very drastic layers with no texturing - and then an A-line cut which looked a little goofy since I have shoulder length hair.
I ended up going to Cassie at Salon G (just down the road) and she fixed my cut and I love it now.

As with the other reviewers, we experienced the same flakiness on timing and communication. She showed up 2 hours late for our appointment and didn't text me saying she was on her way until she was already an hour and a half late. She charged $80 to shave my cat and trim her claws which seemed a little steep. The shave looked a little sloppy and our cat is super chill so it's not like it should have been hard to shave her. She also told us our cat (who we'd had less than a week) might have feline HIV based on some spots she saw on the skin and she recommended we take her to Nikki's Place to get checked. This of course concerned us and we asked our own vet who said the tests they ran showed negative. I don't know if this lady was trying to drum up business for Nikki's or if she actually thought there was an issue, but it just seemed weird. Definitely won't use her again but unfortunately there aren't a ton of options for cat groomers.

My experience in dealing with this place was mediocre. I went to their web site to schedule an appointment online to have my cat shaved. There were a ton of openings available so I picked the most convenient. Two days later I got an email from them saying they couldn't keep the appointment and they would call me to reschedule. I knew they wouldn't get around to calling me, so I called them and was told their cat groomer was out for a month. I mentioned their site is full of available dates and times, but the response back was a simple "Sorry." It doesn't mean they don't do a good job grooming, but it was obvious the woman on the phone just didn't care and that's a turn off for me.

I keep wanting to like this place, but every time I come I am disappointed by something. The food is fairly tasty and different than the typical deli. But for example, today I ordered a BLT and got a sandwich with a bunch of bacon crumbs thrown on it and 2 tiny tomatoes. BLT's I've had here before were not this bad. It's stuff like this which frustrates me about The Spot. It's not consistent. I think they were busy and literally threw my sandwich together. But that's no excuse.

I have been going to this Chiropractic location for 14 years.  Even though I don't even live in the neighborhood.

There are 2 Chiropractors on duty. Watson and Barlot.  I have gone too both of them, and recommend both of them.  I have also done graston and ART with both of them.

I have used the Acupuncture and Massage in the past, but have not used them for about 10 years.  As I don't know the staff, and have not used them in a long time, if I needed Acupuncture or a Massage, I would go see someone closer to home.

The staff in general are very nice, and want to get to know you on a personal level vs. just being a number.

But I will continue using the Chiropractors, and drive the distance to continue seeing them.

This place is beyond amazing.  The food is soooooo good.  The service was amazing.  Our waitress was really good and attentive. It was just a great dinning experience.  We love the craft beers here and the view is a topper. We order the Attic wings and the Ivan burger, they were killer.  When in Arcadia must make a stop here.  They caterer to the late crowds on the weekends.  Wednesday are 10$ for a beer and burger deal.  They ask you don't split it, which is fine because it's a deal.  We can't wait to go back.  It really is a hidden spot.

Our stay at Mandalay Bay was such a pain in the ass that I had to let others know what to expect.
 First, when I checked in I found out that they didn't have the room I reserved available - a king bed and a strip view were part of my girlfriend's birthday present, as she had never been to Vegas and I wanted to show her the town from what I thought would be a perfect hotel.  I thought that reserving a room like that over the phone (and even paying for a night up front!) would get me the room I needed but no, there is no way to be sure that you're getting what you want or pay for at this place.
 The check-in procedure took AN HOUR thanks to an incompetent chump and sassy desk manager (she started giving me attitude like it was my fault they didn't have my room available!  wtf?) while my girlfriend sat out in the car, surrounded by drunks, in their driveway.  If that wasn't bad enough, this front desk hassle made us too late for my special birthday dinner!  Where I had a hook-up!  This was the first night in Vegas and already Mandalay Bay was losing me time and money!
 That night, I tried to put our expensive leftovers into a fridge but discovered that the only mini-fridge in the room was full of beverages that you couldn't move or else the computerized weight system would charge you immediately.  So, no fridge!  Even Super 8 has a mini-fridge!  We went to bed that night enraged.
 The next night we ordered $22 nachos from room service (there was a $5 "cover charge" ... just another cutthroat fee at this place).  I didn't get the room service guy's name because I was too busy staring at - seriously - LESIONS on his face, neck, and even wrist!  It wasn't acne, it was some kind of exczema or something.  I've never not eaten nachos before in my life, that night was a total waste of food and money.  Why hire room service guys who destroy your appetite!?  Isn't that a health code violation too?
 Finally, I was looking forward to talking to the front desk as I checked out.  The clerk asked the people in front of me "did you enjoy your stay with us?" so I figured that would be my opportunity to let Mandalay Bay know that it was really not an accomodating place to stay.  However, the front desk clerk just checked me out without even talking and moved right on to the next in line with cold dead eyes.  I should have stayed and asked for a manager but I was honestly too tired and frustrated to fight.  
 "Disappointed" cannot even begin to describe our stay at Mandalay Bay.  I had hoped to take my birthday party there this summer for their awesome pools but there's no way I'm going to put up with their incompetent, scuzzy staff, poor reservation schedule, and counterproductive accomodations.  Thanks for ruining my girlfriend's birthday and first time in Vegas, Mandalay Bay!

Divine! These bagels and bialys are so delicious. You will not be disappointed. I can eat these plain they taste that good. Mish mosh and egg are my favorites. You walk in and the smell of fresh made bagels fills the air. They serve these hot off the racks. Highly recommend this place if you would like to treat yourself to the way a real bagel should taste.

Absolutely one of the best experiences I have ever had. Even with the late notice they were able to fit me into their schedule and really understood my situation with the Scorpions and that I couldn't have that with my two-year-old daughter running around. Would highly recommend these guys to anyone out there who's looking for Pest Control. And not that everyone is going to agree with this but it also helps that I find out Brad is a Dallas Cowboys fan .....that was just a bonus....lol.A+++++ service and and very knowledgeable.

Great Job Maui!! Very helpful, knowledgeable had my computer fixed in timely manner. I had a 5 yr old dell XPS 8000 with the same parts the computer came with. Haven't made any changes for awhile, suddenly my computer froze. I tried to reboot the system, my computer froze again. I took my computer to ICU Computer Solutions talked to Maui, explained my problem, couple a days, came back the computer was fixed. I was back in business. If your not that Tech-savvy as I am and you need expertise service, I would go with ICU Computer Solutions for any computer problems or upgrades.

I had called handyman for several jobs that I wanted done? They had called me to arrange everyone to come on same day as I have a crazy work schedual . Even though these appointments were pre booked they cancelled one as the trade had to go to a bigger job. Not cool at all!!! The plumber got tied up so it ended up that both plumber and electricIan came at same time. Duanne Askew the electrician was terrific and finished the job off with a fair price as the lights I picked were not the easiest to install. Plumber was fine but could not give me a quote as the sink I had chosen was not the right size. Said to just call him when I got correct one and he would give me a quote. Since then haven't heard from him at all even though I have left several messages. For me the expierence has been less than satisfactory and I think they only want to do large projects even though their advertising implies that small jobs are top of mind. Will not use again. Can do my own search for trades

tried 3 types of pierogies:

- bacon and cheddar: tasty! good pierogies, this was the first thing I tried so I was fairly impressed. but then...
- jerk chicken: dry chicken filling, sauce on the side was just ok. have tasted much better jerk flavoured sauces. but then it got worse:
- kimchi: weird textured and bland tasting mushroom filling, barely any kimchi on top, and the kimchi wasn't even good. disappointing and definitely not worth my money.

for $2 a pierogi, I want them all to be good. They should stick with the classic pierogies, in my opinion, the only ones worth eating (which is why they get 2 stars and not 1).

tried the asian dishes, the japanese noodle one has so much sodium! the thai style ones were bland tasting, the peanut sauce noodles was the best of the bunch. the chicken and steak had the texture of those frozen tv dinners (like swanson), but the price for what you get, given it's in prime real estate is ok. i'd prefer to spend my money on better food though.

I really wanted to like this place and rate it better. 

Spacious room with lots of natural light. Sunday morning breakfast for 2, arrived at 9:30 and seated right away. 

Room wasn't full, but at least 5 other tables near us were people who had placed orders and waiting for food. 

Server was pleasant and took our order (a skillet and an egg dish (clearly not memorable)). Coffee came after maybe 10mins. Still drinking mine when refills were circling nearby tables. Didn't see this happen the rest of the time I was there (had to flag someone down).

Maybe i should have read more in advance but I was still shocked that it took 50mins to get our food after we ordered. Being able to see the open kitchen and no one looking like they were working very hard was extra frustrating. Our server disappeared after serving the first coffees and at 45mins in, I asked someone about how much longer it might be for the food. There was no apologetic tone or anything out of the ordinary. I went early to avoid waiting but was starving by the time the food arrived.

The food was tasty and not a bad price for a decent portion. The service, the slowness, not my thing. I can understand leisurely meals or waiting when the room is full or the staff are busting their butts. This wasn't the case. 

I likely won't return. But tip for anyone who does - order the scones with your breakfast. Saw other tables get those early on, probably tides you over to distract from the extremely long wait. Don't look at the kitchen either or it may make you question why they can't move any faster than a snail's pace with the cooking

yes! made to order corn tortillas, oaxaca cheese in their quesadillas. been here twice and recommend the camarones taco and the campechano taco (sooooo good, great flavours and texture). friendly staff. almost over attentive service at times. the only things preventing a 5 star are i found the guacamole slightly bland, and the horchata a bit too sweet (the one at tacos 101 was better). love the decor as well. wish i lived closer to go more often!

Loved having the option of flights and enough choices on tap
Beer-battered cheese curds are popular for a reason! Beef stew was great too. 
wanted to give this 5 stars, but out of 7 beers tried, not one was a 'wow'. Will return to try more beers, hoping for a standout, the way I enjoy some of bellwoods IPAs

Within a half hour drive of Duo I don't think there's any place with comparable croissants. In fact, when they are super fresh out of the oven and still warm,
they are really great. I can't think of many bakeries in the area I can experience that, and the going rate for decent croissants aren't any cheaper elsewhere. 

Espresso based coffees are excellent as well.

I haven't had many of their cakes and other pastries but enjoyed the one with chocolate and yuzu. They look beautiful and it's obvious a lot of care and attention is paid to everything made and displayed there.  I will definitely be back to try more!

I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could. Had been meaning to try the original Buca for a couple years. Finally went on a Friday, sat in the back area, surprisingly not very full. 

Our server was semi-helpful with the menu, maybe I didn't ask the right questions. "Everything is good" doesn't help much. The sommelier was helpful and narrowed our wine choices down and we were happy with the med-bodied red blend we chose

Cocktails to start were decent but not memorable. Charcuterie plate was overpriced for what was served. Flavor was good with the meats but not stand out, portions super skimpy. Next time I would skip charcuterie and try something else like the pig ears 

Pastas were excellent. Bucatini and the spaghetti. Cooked perfectly, wonderful flavours. Possibly better because I got to try both and enjoyed the contrast. 

The tiramisu dessert wasn't my preference. I like more traditional tiramisu. 

Had to ask for water refill twice (and waited to see if one of many people who came by/bussed/refilled wine/checked on how things were going would notice, they never did). The server finally noticed on his own to refill as we were settling up the bill. A simple but important detail like this in a finer dining establishment is very disappointing. 

The space is gorgeous and the pastas as good as people have raved about. I'd return and hope for a better server.

In a city with very few places offering croissants done right, Mabel's does a pretty good job. Their pecan pie is great for those who love it, and the beef empanada had a flaky, tasty pastry and ample beefy filling. Get it with the chimichurri. 

I've got my eye on the baguettes and bagels for my next visit.

the staff seemed pleasant enough, until after a lengthy exchange in which I, as a first time visitor, asked about 3 or 4 of the options, and finally made my choice, was then told that the one I wanted they were out of :(  given the staff was at the station preparing another mac and cheese as we spoke, and it wasn't busy, I was very disappointed they didn't tell me up front what they were out of.

and more importantly, after waiting a few minutes while the food was in the oven, I walked the short 4minute walk home to eat a small $7 mac and cheese that was unevenly cooked. some bites were hot, others were lukewarm. if this is all you are selling, it would make sense to make sure the food is thoroughly hot?!

i like the concept and want to return, but not sure it is worth the money.

i had heard about fresh soba for probably years and finally tried it a few weeks ago.  On Tuesdays, we made a reservation earlier in the day, it wasn't busy at all when the 4 of us arrived. I loved the texture of the fresh soba, preferring the one that isn't already in sauce (the sauce makes it a bit mushy over time). The dishes aren't cheap, and they only take cash, but I enjoyed my experience and would go back. It's worth supporting people who are passionate and care to make quality food like this!

I saw photos of this space from a blogto review and checked it out when i was in the neighbourhood a few weeks ago. it is a cool looking spot. i had a latte, it was good, but not super different than other cafes I frequent.

service was pleasant, though the guy who was at the register did not have great English, and got confused when I asked if they had decaf espresso, as I didn't see the menu. I was overcharged for a latte and a separate espresso, but the other staff was quick to help with my order so it was resolved without issues.

the place had individuals spreadout across the room working on laptops, one per table, and spaced out equally on bar seating. they have two chairs next to the entrance which worked fine for me.

overall it was pleasant, but given the location and price for me, I wouldn't go out of my way to return.

first off, it surprises me Yunaghi hasn't gotten more good press.  they deserve it. there isn't anyone else doing the same thing in Toronto at that price point. the beautiful composition of each dish takes care and attention to detail. seasonal menus (it was Oct when I went), and options for wine or sake only pairings.  servers were friendly and explained each dish (sometimes a bit challenging to ask more questions but they tried to answer). i would return to see what's on offer next year!

chicken is good, i like the power flock and frenchie flock. 
service is slow, it's like they can't properly manage the flow of orders.

the handful of times I have ordered there, it has taken at least 10 min wait (and not during prime lunch or dinner time). i'm not ordering something very complicated - a bowl that is an assembly of salad ingredients, a dressing from a squeeze bottle and pieces of chicken on top.

paying $17-18 for a chicken salad, and having to wait that long isn't what I consider good value. it's tasty enough that I won't write them off, but I won't be ordering it often, and will try calling ahead to reduce my wait time, hopefully they will be able to work out some of the timing on the orders.

I couldn't be more happy with my experience at Pure Facials.  I went in for a free consultation regarding lip injections and met with Dr Denise Curtis.  She answered every question I had and her knowledge and confidence is what led me to go ahead with the procedure.  When I say she is top of the line I'm not kidding!  I am now three days out from receiving my filler and I couldn't be more pleased with the results!  Very natural looking.  Very little pain and bruising.  I would highly recommend her services to anyone.

I visited this restaurant at the end of March because I heard the food was great. I was very disappointed with the customer service. The cashier Caleb was not very friendly as he greeted me .  No smile or have a nice day in fact he didn't seem too pleased to take my order.  The waitress Jessica also wasn't friendly . There was no kind word or smile as she shoved my food into my hands. Never once did I hear , "have a nice day or thank you "  The food was great but the customer service didn't make me want to return .  I visited a place called Yardbird and all their staff smiled and said , Hi .  As I left Yardbird every staff member I came across smiled and said , thank u for coming, have a good day or come back and see us as they smiled .  I felt more welcomed and appreciated at Yardbird.  Good Customer service is very important to me.

If there was 0 star option this is what this dealer would get. My nightmare began after getting the car delivered from this dealer. I asked that they be careful with my car and the initial promises were all good and they'll take care of it. I received the car and the bottom bumper was scratched and neither the dealer nor the shipping company they used took responsibility for the damage even though they all promised they'll get it taken care of. Then comes the paperwork, they were behind on getting their registration paperwork to my local DMV and after 2 months finally get it through and because of that I was charged with 400 in late penalties in getting my car registered and not including the temporary tags I had to pay for so I can drive the car in Texas. None of them will return your phone calls and you'd be lucky to get a hold of them, including all the managers. The finance manager promised to pay for my temporary tags and I received nothing. I would not recommend buying from them if you're out of state and good luck after the purchase, they're quick and grabbing your money but the service is horrible. This is one of the reasons why I will never own a BMW.

On the advice of a friend, I went to this place early in the day just before the holidays for a special treat of shellac mani and pedi. I don't do these often, as it is not in the family budget, so I was looking forward to it. And the place looked nice and shiny inside. Well, I was completely disappointed with the results. First, the pedi.The "spa pedi" I asked for didn't include the removal of dead skin cells with the razor or other scraping tool. The woman gave my feet a quick 10 second brush with a pink pumice and then on to the "massage" she prided herself on, which lasted for a whole 60 seconds at best and was nothing special. That was a huge disappointment, as this is one of the parts of a pedicure it's hard to pull off at home. I am prone to having ingrowns, so I was VERY specific that the woman should cut straight across for the pedi, leaving the corners alone! Well, she cut the nails straight across, but then she got fierce with the nail nipper. Before I even knew what she was doing, she had cut at a diagonal on the corners of one of my big toes. Worse, when I got home, I realized that she had actually visibly CUT the cuticle on the side of that same toe, further down. And I had to treat it with antibacterial ointment for several days before the pain and swelling subsided. Also, I noticed that the tools she used seem to be in her own personal toolbox, which was fine, but I have no idea if they were floating around in water or in some sort of antibacterial solution. I am praying it was the latter. [Note to self: next time look for a place that assigns you your own set of tools and stores them for you or clearly shows you how their tools are kept clean] As for the shellac mani, the woman piled on so much and so many layers of polish that it looked and felt as if I was actually wearing fake nails! And the so-called "2 weeks at least" shellac manicure lasted a whole of four days before the shellac bubbled at the edges and began coming off of the nails in large swathes.  Never again.

No, No, No and NO!!!  I'd been going to this location for some time, though their services were a bit pricy, because I liked the cleanliness and modern look of the place. Waxing and shellac manis, mostly, and holiday pedis that were meh at best. (Despite my asking for specific toe nail grooming due to previous injury, they tried to pressure me into doing it "their way," which made me feel uncomfortable.) But, my real disappointment began when they started trying to sell stuff to my young teenage daughter in my absence. More than once, I'd come in to pay for my 13 year old's service, and they'd have a line-up of supposedly luxe "teen" skincare products (some of them for blemishes, etc) at the register which she told me she felt pressured into approving of. And, more than once, I had to tell them absolutely not. She was coming in for basic grooming, services that were for fun, not to be told/to have it implied that she was inadquate in any way. And NO WAY you should be asking a minor to make purchases.lWe will NOT be returning.

I was looking for a dim sum place while in Las Vegas and decided to check this place out after reading the reviews. I must say, I was definitely not disappointed.

The dim sum selection and taste is by far the best I've ever tasted in US. It was a pity that it was just 2 of us and we could only stomach that much food. I would have loved to try more.

My top top favorites:
- The egg tarts (they taste just like those you'd find in HK). We had 3 plates of that and I wish I could pack to bring home but they wouldn't taste as nice then. 

- The soya beancurd is so smooth and the ginger taste is very subtle that blends in with the beancurd. I've tasted the soya beancurd in another restaurant and it was just too gingery. We ordered additional 2 portions to go and had them chilled when we reached home. They tasted just as great chilled & warm.

- Chives dumplings were also good.

I would definitely visit this restaurant when I head to LV again. Service was also decent. Carts of dim sum were being pushed around the whole restaurant.

We called Bryan when we had a mold problem that nobody could seem to find the source of. He spent the time to look over everything we had had done already, came to the house, spent almost two hours walking through and highlighting things to us, explaining the significance, etc. Then he gave us detailed information about what he would do, what things to watch out for, and what he would do in the meantime. The thing that impressed us the most is he didn't charge for any of it and even told us things that we could do (e.g., renting air movers from Home Depot instead of from him) that would be more convenient for us but lose him money. I wish everyone could be like Bryan - awesome service and great explanations. Definitely seems way more above board than some of the more popular mold remediation outfits.

We contacted Daryl initially to help us identify/address a source of a moldy smell in our home.  He had extraordinary reviews, so we provide this one just to present our different experience.

He was immediately reachable, very prompt with arranging a home visit, and always very confident in his assertions.  While his speed in identifying our problem and readiness to discuss his (possibly excellent) credentials repeatedly would be a positive to many, we felt that he reached his conclusions a bit TOO quickly and mentioned his background and all his competitors' inadequacies TOO frequently.  Possibly just a clash of personalities, but...

We weren't feeling confident in the diagnosis and remediation he proposed and looked for another opinion just to do our due diligence (but we are certainly NOT experts).  We subsequently learned of a few red flags:  
(1)  MoldEx does their own specimen collection (not the actual testing, though) which other contractors believe is a conflict of interest (i.e., there's an incentive to find a problem and to prove that the work has resolved it).
(2)  A more thorough inspection revealed an entirely different source for our moldy smell which would NOT have been addressed had we gone with the MoldEx remediation plan.

During this process (before we found what is likely the right source), we contacted Daryl to ask a few follow-up questions, planning to hire him.  I must have given him the (totally incorrect) impression that other contractors were standing by to do the work for us, because his brief response was that he was busy and must pass on our job.  "I'm sure the people providing you with this information will be more than happy to take care of you", he replied.  We took this to mean that he was offended by our potentially getting other opinions.  We felt rather put off and left a fairly scathing review.  Next day he called to inquire about it (I appreciated that).  I explained what our concerns were and that we did not, in fact, have any other options available to us.  I revisited my questions with him; he told me he'd talk if I took down the review (I was unimpressed with that).  He called the next day when I hadn't, then tracked down my spouse's work number and left a message there.  We were left with a fairly sour taste.

After looking at about 15 different apartments in Phoenix and Scottsdale, I have found my home. After taking a tour of Broadstone camelback I couldn't imagine living any place else. The location is perfect, the apartments are fantastic, and staff is very friendly and super helpful. I can't wait to move into my new apartment.

When they're good they're great. Service was awesome. Mac n cheese was amazing, my husband liked the brisket, wedge salad was pretty good. They give a free half order of onion rings to first timers. They also had no issue brining samples of the sauces so my husband could decide which he liked. Their North Carolina BBQ was pretty awful though. And we weren't terribly impressed by the spinach artichoke dip.

I should've heeded the warning reviews. It's August in Phoenix and my AC in my car quit working. They made an appointment with me Friday over the phone to diagnose the problem and warned me since I had an after market warranty they might not be able to get in touch with them on a Saturday but that they would try. They said the earliest they could get me in was 1. I showed up at 1 and they told me they had two hours of oil changes ahead of me and that they could keep it until Tuesday and look at it then. I work during the week- hence why I made an appointment for a Saturday. I asked why they made an appointment with me if they didn't have time to look at my car and they said they didn't know and they weren't sure who I spoke to. I told them the person I spoke to said their name was josh, but josh claimed he never spoke to me. Massive waste of time since not only did they not fix my car or even look at it they made the appointment so late it's impossible to me find another shop who can work with me today!

Their customer service sucks. They didn't seem to have a great selection to choose from. They also don't offer much in the way of public service. They were also inconsistent about what they do offer. Over the phone I was told I could use a scanner (because they have it and it doesn't cost them anything) when I came in they told me to try staples.

The salsa was delicious and super fresh! The chips were nice and warm. The manager was on it! He was not only checking up on his employees he was helping out! Our server Joe was great, even though he was in a hurry he checked on us regularly. The dinner portions were slightly smaller than expected, but my husband and I liked our pollo especial fundido, and chicken chimi with fundido sauce (even though the fundido was much spicier than expected since we're used to garcia's fundido). My mother in law was not impressed with the chile rellenos as she thought it needed cheese. Didn't try the drinks or desserts this time but will definitely be back!

They were supposed to show up between 12 and 2. We had already moved out and the office had to let them in. We called at 3 to confirm that they came because our lease required us to have the carpets professionally cleaned before move out inspection which was the next afternoon. They had not shown up and said they would be there around 6 pm. The office closes at 5:30 and we were an hour away. He said he'd come first thing the next morning (which he did), and upsold me on conditioning the living room because it all looked like a high traffic area $20 and $35 to remove an un identifiable red stain the size of my head (if it wasn't done to the apartments satisfaction they would've charged us to do the whole thing again). I didn't get to go to the move out inspection but my husband said the carpet looked brand new and that the inspector used a black light to examine the carpet (we have a cat), and the only thing that showed on the carpet was some detergent which they didn't care about. 

TL;DR? They didn't show up on time, they did upsell, but they did do a fantastic job! If not in a hurry I would use them again.

Stopped in today for lunch. Every previous experience has been great. Today was terrible. I walked in and sat down. The waitress kept on looking at my table and walking to other tables around me. After about 10 minutes the waitress asked if I was waiting for someone and I said no that I was alone. I ordered some water and she brought me some and the menu. I was ready to order right away and as I was talking to her she turned and walked away. I sat and waited as other patrons came in and sat down. The owner tended to them and the same waitress brought them their drinks and began to take their orders. I kept on waiting patiently for her to stop by but she proceeded to clear empty tables as well as ask other tables about their meals and if they needed anything.  After 25 minutes I decided to leave since nearly half of my lunch hour had passed with no true service.

I own a 2006 Hyundai Sonata and love my car. I have been wanting to go in and purchase a second Sonata from Centennial Hyundai but after reading all of these reviews of the Sahara location I have serious reservations in doing so now. First impressions are everything but follow up and continued customer care after a big purchase are an absolute necessity. Despite the positive there are an alarming amount of negative reviews I feel I may steer clear of these dealerships even if there has been a change in ownership.

It's not too often that you order a burger and end up with a three course meal.  It's even less often that all three of those courses turn out to be good!

On a course-by-course basis;

The tater tots were tasty; light, fluffy, and delicious with the accompanying aioli.

The signature Hodge Burger was good, but not great.  The ingredients went well together, but the overall experience wasn't one that has stuck with me.  It was certainly well above average, but not outstanding, and not something I would go out of my way to sample.  The kitchen did cook the meat perfectly, which was a plus.

The cornbread was INCREDIBLE.  I don't particularly like cornbread; it's never been my thing.  I generally avoid it if I can.  But the cornbread at Hodge's- it's to die for, especially with the maple bourbon butter.  OH MY GOD.

I would bring a companion here just so I could watch their face as they have the joy of sampling the cornbread for the first time.

Pittsburgh has a serious lack of quality ethnic food choices, and Seviche is without question the best of the available options.

Having said that, Seviche is a worthwhile destination in its own right.

The ceviche bar is unique, and the recommendations of the staff were on-point.  The sauce / fish combinations that I chose were excellent.  I also ended up ordering a  bocadillo, which was full of flavor, perfectly balanced, and filling.  The kitchen sent out some complementary tapas towards the end of the evening which, though I don't remember what they were, were also delicious.

The wait staff was delightful, and kept me engaged the whole evening.

The beer menu is lacking, and they only have bottles.  It's definitely more of a wine and cocktail type of restaurant.

I'm tempted to dock a star because the music was obnoxiously loud by the end of the evening, but the overall experience was so outstanding that I'm happy to overlook it.

I stopped by Kaya in my search for an amazing burger in Pittsburgh (spoiler: Winghart's won by a mile).  The Kaya burger looked unique and delicious, so I set out across town to try one.

Maybe it was the beef (which did arrive cooked perfectly), or maybe it was just that the kaya sauce just didn't jive with the fried egg, pickles, and avocado.  Whatever it was, while I enjoyed the burger (great bun, and delicious fries), it didn't WOW me like I had hoped it would.

The interior is super cute, and the service was good though the kitchen was slow.  That gave me more time to drink, which is always fine, though Kaya's bar was a little on the light side for worthwhile beers.

3.5 stars, rounded down, but I will without question be stopping by Kaya next time I'm through Pittsburgh to try some of their other menu items.  I expect great things.

I'm not really clear on what's going on with L'Entrepôt. The food is pretty good - and plentiful! But the drinks menu is something out of a terrible college bar. The mixed drinks are bad. Really bad. Like, *really bad*. And weak. Should I find myself back in Montreal, I would definitely stop by L'Entrepôt again - it's cute, and fun, and poppin', but I'd definitely stick to shots or beer if I was drinking alongside my massive $5 sandwich.

Okay, it's a little grungy, but that's how a coffee shop in a grungy neighborhood should be.  The employee that helped me was a bit hippydippy, which fit in perfectly with the atmosphere of the place.  It's about as genuine and unpretentious of a hole in the wall hipster coffeehouse as I've ever been to.  I mean, according to a conversation that I had, Beehive hosts a periodic dance party where customers bring in vinyl and they just kind of play whatever and have a good time.

Perfect.

The Shipwreck Burger is the second best burger I've had in the United States, without question.  Believe the hype.

I came to this location because the Market Square shop was undergoing major renovations and was closed for several weeks.  I'm glad I did; I absolutely love the neighborhood, which Winghart's blends right in to.  The seedy interior was complementary to the food, which came from the kitchen perfectly cooked- medium rare, of course!

I stopped by during lunch, and while the place was disconcertingly empty, the waitstaff was pleasant and attentive, and took the time to chat with myself and my coworker.

They have a pretty well-stocked bar, and next time I'm in the area I'll make sure to take advantage of it.

I popped in to the Frick because, well, why not?  I had the afternoon free and the weather was beautiful.

Sure, it's not MOMA, or the Met, or LACMA.  What were you expecting?  But what the main collection lacks in cachet, it makes up for with its outstanding curators.  I can't rave enough about how friendly and knowledgeable the staff are.  They went out of their way to describe the history and intricacies of each work of art.  It made even the most average of pieces come alive.

The car collection was amazing, and the staff in the outbuilding were equally helpful.  The gentleman that I spoke with went through the collection car by car, giving an enormous amount of detail and history for each vehicle.  It made what would have been an average visit fantastic.

I didn't have a chance to do the tour of the mansion, but I did walk around the grounds, and they're perfect to while away some free time on a nice day.

Solid choice for airport fare. Stopped in for breakfast before a flight. I ordered the pulled pork breakfast burrito. The pork was tender and flavorful. The ingredients weren't mixed well, however, and I had pockets of eggs, cheese and cilantro clumped throughout. I wish they were more evenly distributed. The homefry style potatoes were top notch, crispy but not dry. 

Staff was attentive and upbeat even early in the morning. 

Heavy rock and roll music was a bit odd for the AM.

My mom and I passed through Paraphernalia Boutique on our way from San Diego to New Hampshire, and she purchased a heavy hitter that she eventually gave to me as a Chanukah present. Chris has been fantastic about offering advice regarding upkeep, replace malfunctioning atomizers, and even sending the replacement parts to me in Ohio (where I attend college). Definitely a shop I would stop at again if I'm ever in Phoenix! Very cool decor too, and some of their jars are fantastic (I personally love the vacu-seal doob tubes that came with the heavy hitter).

If you walk in and see hair on the ground it's because the barbers are always busy cutting quality haircuts. Again, this is a barbershop. If you are looking for a sensitive, P.C. barbershop, this is not the place for you. Go to Supercuts.

Came here to have the lobster pasta since this is what it (and joe beef) are famous for... i have to say i loooved their pork belly dish much much more. It was in a wonderful shrimp and mussel sauce, and perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender!
Hubby loved the oysters too! 

The pasta was definitely rich, but there was a je ne sais quois missing... maybe the lobster needed salt? Some kind of spice missing? Perhaps there was so much hype around this dish that it just fell short of my high expectations! However, the portion was more than generous! I couldnt finish the pasta! Gluttonous indeed! 

The rhubarb sherbert/icecream/and meringue dessert was also spectacular!

Ate here on our last night in Montreal, wish i had tried it sooner! Ate a few other places including one of the more hyped up spots in the area, which came in slightly under expectations. Bocata was amazing! The food was delicious, the ambience was spot on, music selection was great! ... but let me get to the food.... 

Had the fried smelt, first time trying this, were delicious, perfecr with the spritz of lemon and then a mayo dip, could have had more! Hubby had the oyster special and loved them. 

The octopus a gallega was tender, and wonderful. But the highlight for me was the squid ink risotto... EAT THIS ... i could have eaten this for every dinner... it was rich and delicious, with a little smokiness from the spicy chorizo, tender little baby squid tentacles, peas, and baby cilantro sprinkled on top. The prawn and scallop served on top were cooked to perfection! Get this, you wont be disappointed!!!! 

The only downside here was that they were out of the crispy chicken skins for the night, which i was dying to try, but they must be good if they ran out! 

5 stars, will recommend to anyone who takes the trip out to mtl. Oh, and make a reservation in advance, and if you cant, download the DINR app to score last minute reservationa from cancellations if you cant find something!

Like another person said, this place is a hit or miss. The last time I went there, I waited 30 minutes on my food with 10 people in the place. I got the grand slam which comes with coffee and choice of juice. I said I wanted orange juice for my juice. I never received my coffee and when I asked about it, the waitress said she thought I only wanted OJ since I didn't ask for coffee. You would think that it was implied that I wanted coffee. Do I have to ask for every thing? Do I ask for hash browns when it says it comes with it? There is a problem every other time I go in this Dennys. I've had sausage that was frozen inside. I gave it 3 stars for the times that the service was good. I've been coming to this location for about 3 years and I've seen a decline in service.

I had a check engine light show up on my 2007 corvette and an occasional rough idle. The car is supercharged and I wanted to take it somewhere that specifically deals with high performance sport tuned vehicles and not some run of the mill auto shop. I chose Doc's based on reviews. As soon as I showed up, the owner came out to see what I needed. I didn't have an appointment scheduled, but he still was able to take the time out to help me on the spot because of the quick nature of diagnosing my problem. He identified the problem and had me back on the road minus the engine light. He was able to adjust some fuel/oxygen parameters that were out of sink with each other. Looks like Doc's will be my go to spot for any further tuning or diagnosing needs.

After leaving the Galleria mall, me and my wife noticed the Saucy bistro. It looks really nice from the outside. It was 2130 on a Saturday and barely any cars were in the parking lot. We noticed a lot of advised specials on the outside of the building. The interior is different but nice. We were seated and asked our waitress about the specials. She began to tell us and then a woman with short blonde hair interrupted and rudely said the happy hour specials don't start until 2200. I guess she's the manager. I understand rules, but C'mon, the place was empty. So the end result was that me and my wife left and they made zero dollars instead of something. I gave it three stars because of the decor and the possibility of decent food

The food is flavored very good. They have an all you can eat marinara or alfredo pasta for $10. Calamari was tender and there was a lot on the plate. Prices rival Olive Garden. The atmosphere was upscale and clean. The music was at a nice level, not too loud. All of the staff was very professional and attentative. Not much bad to say about Bistro 57 besides its location and the fact that Aliante Casino has the tightest machines outside of the strip which keeps the casino kinda empty. In Summerlin, this place would be packed on the weekend. The place looks too fancy for the area and I figure most people walk past it heading to the buffet, Friday's, or the food court.

The manager "Justin Parker" at this location is rude and condescending.  While the staff is accommodating the manager "Justin Parker" will interrupt and make rude comments.  Be aware the deposit for this location is $300 or $100+cost of the rental, which ever is higher.  I was not aware of this unusual policy and when I said the airport location doesn't charge a $300 deposit, Justin said "Well go and rent from there, that is our policy", and he glared at me.  Then my daughter offered her Visa debit card and they said she had to have "2 Utility bills with her name on it"....really, who travels with two of their utility bills immediately in their possession?  We were unable to rent the car, they close in 1-hour and the wedding we had to drive to was in 3 hours.  Then Justin Parker (the manager), told the driver "take these ladies back to where ever", really loud in the office, it was humiliating.  A good manager shows leadership and has the skills to handle a difficult situation, not insult customers and send them on their way with tacky behavior and rude remarks.  It was weird, like he got some kind of thrill showing off how he could treat us.  

I have rented from Enterprise for at least 20 years, and this is the first time I have ever been treated in such a shabby manner.  This manager is a very poor representative of a company that I used hold in the highest esteem.  I will not rent from them again, I usually rent several times a year.

Lord have mercy, this place is in strong contention for best downtown Mexican food. Strong drinks and fresh, delicious food at very reasonable prices. When you tire of Macayos and all the other cheap knockoffs, get your soon-to-be-chubbier behind to La Santisima.

When it comes to independent mechanics specializing in Mercedes Benz, there's none better at what they do. What they do is pinpoint hard-to-find issues and fix only what needs fixing for the Benz owner on a budget. Bring any model or year and let him have at it, you will not be disappointed.

I'm still itemizing my items and will be posting my review shortly.  At this point I have 4 pieces of designer glass/chrome pieces of furniture missing (of course, they didn't photograph these four furniture items but there's a glimpse of the coffee table in one of their overall photographs with everything pushed together so they could remove a designer sofa -- still wet with water from flood which they took immediately for the weight factor for insurance pay) a brand new Kohler faucet still in manufacturer's box (no big deal in comparison to my furniture!) that one of their workmen kept placing in a "throw away" pile in driveway.  I removed it three (3) times out of the pile!!  Two of their workmen were involved in my garage placing whatever they desired into the "throw away" pile.  I stopped the job the following day -- unfortunately, with my house drenched in water and a different agreement the job resumed.  The adjuster was no help as far as advice in this situation.  I had a bad experience with this company from Day 1 of the pack out (trying to steal items) and the furniture they returned is banged, scratched and one of the sofas has rips in the fabric.  It's a black exquisite, contemporary, fabric (special order) and had some fade due to all windows (tons of sunlight) but was in perfect, excellent, condition when they removed them.  No one ever sat on them except during holidays.  

Insurance companies shouldn't send these type of companies to their clients' homes.  Chubb Insurance should be rated horribly for sending this company to my home.

There is no category for my rating and if I have to click on a 'star' above in order to start my review so be it!!

We threw up the food was so bad!!!

First thing my girlfriend and I noticed when we got there was that no one working was smiling or looked enthused. 

Our waiter acted like he couldn't give a flying f@ck and didn't ask "how was your day?" or any niceties like that, instead just taking our drink and food order.  No small talk whatsoever.

Waiting for our drinks or some bread or something while waiting for our food, but no, my food arrives before our drinks!  I see the waiter bringing other drinks and putting glasses away but he looked like he didn't care, which seemed to be the general attitude of the place.

My girlfriend and I both ended up throwing up after we returned to our hotel!!!  We were both picking off each others' plates, but I suspect it was the meatloaf, as it was cold on the inside. We got our food within ten minutes of ordering, so they couldn't have cooked a salmon and meatloaf in that time! They must have pre-cooked it and kept it on the warmer.  Today we are paying the price and are laid up in bed.

I've eaten at Toronto Tower and Seattle Tower many times and have had no problems. The Calgary Tower was the worst experience ever. And on top of things, I tipped the bugger 15%, when in fact I feel like suing the restaurant.

Fabulous place for all occasions- from a family weekend brunch to a weekend night out.  The one restaurant to eat in Montreal if you had to eat all your meals in one restaurant. 

Great service (even nice to the kids). 
Delicious food. 
And a menu that everyone can find something to love.

And delicious profiteroles.

Staying here is like being in a time capsule and re-visiting a luxury resort from the 1980s. The place hasn't had much in the way of capex for a few decades and it shows. The owners - Starwood - are milking this for all its worth. If they could just hold off, it will probably be fabulous again in about a decade as that 80s-retro-resort-glitz comes back in style. But knowing Corporate America's lack of prescient timing, they will probably renovate at just the wrong time. Go to the steakhouse for dinner while there.

The rooms are quite nice (for the price) but the service is slipping. The food at the restaurant is overpriced and just ok (except for the croissants, which are delicious).

The gym smells horrible and is quite small. 

And our visit was made much more complicated by the fact that the garage is out of service for a month or two- so instead of just parking the car at the hotel, one has to park around the corner. This is normally not a big deal, but with Montreal weather, luggage, and kids in tow, it makes everything more difficult.

I contacted Michael Darrow (Sales) who came and provided new build Water Feature design and Pool deck refurbishment ideas for me.
Michael was very personable, professional and visionary in helping me.
His company office staff were very professional in handling call backs re: scheduling of materials and service.
The two pro craftsmen Michael picked to do my pool work were OUTSTANDING (pride in their work individuals).

This is one of the best (if not the best) places for tacos in the Phoenix area. We've tried several different tacos and quesadillas and everything has been delicious. It's also the closest I've seen to authentic Mexican in Phoenix. The variety of salsas makes it fun to eat these dishes.

The street tacos were excellent. I enjoyed the chicken, carne asada, and mahi mahi tacos. I ordered them a la carte so I didn't get the rice and beans on the side. My husband ordered some tacos with rice and beans and I noticed that the rice and beans looked very dry and a bit stale. I tried them and they definitely were not fresh. I looked over to the plates of others and the rice and beans looked the same. 

It is a shame that they serve the sides this way because the tacos were delicious.

Although this place is conveniently located, there are a few reasons I would not recommend:

1. I would describe the customer service as awkward. They're not blatantly rude, but they're not friendly either. They seem to just not care.

2. They tore a blouse of mine and didn't say anything to me when I picked up. I only noticed a few months later when I wanted to wear the blouse again.

3. A few items have come back looking like they were not cleaned. They smell odd, like stale chemicals. Don't know how else to describe it.

Will not be going back to this place. Looking for a new one...

Today was a very different experience than in the past. First, the restaurant did not seem as busy: it was 9:30 a.m. and there are usually people waiting for a table. That felt a little odd because a busy restaurant is a sign of good food and service. The service was fast, but one of our orders was wrong so they had to go back and fix it. Then when my order was finally ready, the hash browns and bacon were overcooked (almost burned in some spots) and looked old, like they had been sitting out a long time. We could also hear the people in the kitchen yelling at each other, which was not pleasant. This was not a good experience because the ambiance was low-energy and sad and the food was pretty bad.

The atmosphere is fine and the service was good. The food was average. I had the stacked christmas enchiladas with chicken. It was a mess of flavors: the chicken was bland and the salsas drowned each other out. Add to that too much pico and the enchiladas turned into a sloppy mess.

We have been in here numerous times and the pizza is always great.  They have a nice selection of quality ingredients that you can choose to build your own pizza and the food always comes out quick.  The real reason for writing this review is not to rave about the quality of the food, but the exceptional service that we experienced tonight while dining in.  The staff are always really friendly but tonight when I asked for a gluten free pizza, they stated they were out of the dough.  Chris (perhaps the manager?) decided that he would go out to pick up more of the gluten free dough, and he dropped what he was doing to run out and get more.  Throughout the experience the staff was friendly and checking up on us, but the fact that they went out of the way like this to accommodate a customer was something that I have not seen before.  We will continue to go back as the food and service are both top notch.

Visited Kirby's Firestone for an oil change and the tire rotation for the first time. I am not sure about the oil change, but the tire rotation wasn't done. I visited there again and requested for the tire rotation and waited for ~15min. At first, I was impressed about their fast work, but when I checked my car, the tires were all in the same place. No tire rotation was performed period. I also noticed that the mechanic touched my items in the passenger compartment and all my documents and items were flipped around. What was he looking for?? I am not sure if any items were missing. It was an extremely disappointing experience.

!!!!!!!!Should be called RIP-OFF-MASTERS!!!!!!!!!!!

Do you want to pay $382.00 for JUST the REAR BRAKES?!?!?!?  If so this is your place!!!

I am a mechanic and while on a long distance road trip I needed my rear brakes done.  Since I did not have my tools with me I had no choice.  When dropping off the car I asked for them to retain any parts that were replaced so I could look at them because I know mechanics make their money by replacing parts that don't need to be replaced.  

Guess what???  These "buggers" did exactly that!!!  They replaced both the rear rotors (discs) that did not need replacing.

They said over the phone "the rotors mic'ed (micrometer measurement) out less and show .010 less than minimum tolerance"  Since I was not there to verify I believed them.

When I picked up the car I visually looked at the old rotors and they looked to be "turn-able" (can be machined to return to serviceable condition).  I pointed out that cast into the rotor is the words  "Minimum thickness .072 inches"  I asked for their micrometer and mic'ed out the discs and verified that the lowest thickness of the wear on the "worst of the two" disc was only .78 inches.  The other one was even thicker... so this means that BOTH DISCS were still within tolerance and could be machined.

So why did they lie to me when they said "the discs were .10 less than minimum tolerance" when they were still serviceable?

Because they are a RIP OFF and are LI ARS and they take YOUR MONEY by replacing your parts that do not need to be replaced!!!

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!

Despite being a somewhat regular that tips 15-20% and frequently order special dishes/seafood, the customer service sucks!

The only reason I visit is because:
- easy to get a table (because it's more expensive than others)
- truffle/foie gras dumplings
- modern interior

Casa Imperial is a better alternative (if you don't care for truffle/foie gras) but it's hard to get a last minute table!

First thing they served was a glass of flat, warm coke; fortunately the waiter was able to get a can of coke. 

Bread, although hot, was tasteless and served with unsalted packaged butter. 

The caprese salad was okay, but given the price, you'd think they would not serve you stale, yellow arugula.

The seafood pasta was decent but the bucatini was no good. 

Despite being one of the few Italian restaurants in Markham and we love Italian food... We will not be returning. Overall a meh experience even when not considering the prices. No wonder it was empty on a Saturday evening.

Not a good experience. Made the reservation several weeks in advance. Poorly greeted, asked to move to another table but told nothing available even though only three tables were taken at the time. Somewhat of a rude response by hostess. Waiter was kind but lacked enthusiasm for a menu that is quite confusing. There was a very bad smell that was offensive and lingered. I think it was that nights dinner. We left without ordering. It was just bad all around.

I'm not a big reviewer but, felt the need on this one. My first visit to have wings and a beer. Guinness was delicious and grilled wings with medium sauce were better than expected. All claims on the friendliest staff are false. Barmaid I had was a disappointment. She was impatient, fake, not at all friendly or welcoming. It wasn't like she was busy at 2:00 PM. If you are not a regular, you don't get the time of day. Many other sports bars to choose from with warmer service. Not worth a return visit.

This is an update to my previous review. I'm changing my rating from a 1 to a 3. I'm doing this because after I wrote the first review, they reached out to me and tried to rectify the situation and the relationship. I appreciate that they made the effort. I can't comment on their work as I decided to go with another company. 

First review:
I called this company once each day for two days to get an estimate on a small job. They did not feel it was necessary to call me back either time, as promised. If you don't want my job, that's fine, just tell me and stop wasting my time. If you don't care, I don't want you working on MY home.

Visiting from the Pacific Northwest when I came upon this place.  The burgers were great. I first had the Philly burger and decided to come back another day to try the gyro burger. Both were great and I highly recommend getting jalapenos in both to get a zing to the burgers. They make their sauces fresh everyday (i.e. ranch).  The owner was very kind as she even gave me a few cucumbers at no charge for my teething daughter. Yes it just a cucumbers but the shear thoughtfulness that the owner had was top notch customer service in my book.  When I come back to Arizona, will definitely be stopping by here again

My association with Windy Wang a licensed acupuncturist and owner of Willow Pond has been a very positive one. I found her to be very  caring, dedicated, friendly and honest. She takes the time to listen and ask questions. I have found her to be highly educated and knowledgeable in her field. She takes the time to answer any questions and it is important to her that you be at ease and comfortable with your visit. She has no hidden fees, she is on time and is very professional. I have recommended Windy to all my friends and I could not have done that if I did not have complete trust and confidence in her.

I love the lazy river and the condo style rooms. The staff are very respectful and helpful. We really enjoyed Booze and Bites restaurant/bar as well. Good beer and the island sale is the bomb!

The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the enforcing of the rules by the teenage lifeguards at the lazy river. They are afraid to tell the guests not to horseplay or run around the lazy river.

Another drawback is that 3 days in a row either the pool or lazy river was completely shutdown due to biohazards which means someone defecated or vomited in the water! Totally gross.

This is probably my favourite neighbourhood pub. 

Sure it's a quiet spot, not the kind of place to see and be seen, but an honest place. Lots of east coasters amongst their regulars - they always make sure you feel welcome. Service is friendly and efficient.

That's where I go whenever I'm in the mood for good and reasonably well priced food. Drinks are cheap too, and beer is always cold. I usually order the 'extreme nachos', and they sure are pretty extreme - I would never be able to eat all that food by myself. Make sure you have company to share it.

This is my favourite falafel place in Calgary. Staff is super friendly, prices are fair, service is usually pretty fast and they're open late on weekends. 

Their tabouleh (salad made with tomatoes, onion, lots of parsley and olive oil) and deserts (especially the baklava) are also worth checking out.

Ok, being a Brazilian and a rodizio fan, I must say: this place is the real deal! I only get to go back home once a year, and Gaucho's is exactly like the Churrascarias back home: all you can eat meat, salad buffet and typical side dishes. 

As for the BBQ meat, my favourites are the Picanha (a must try, in my opinion), costela (ribs) and chicken heart. 

Make sure to let the waiters know if you like your meat well done. In Brazil is common to have it done a little on the raw side. 


PS.: All my canadian friends are grossed out by the thought of it, but I strongly encourage everybody to try the grilled chicken hearts. Tasty stuff, I guarantee!

I can't understand what's the hype about this place.

After reading many good reviews, decided to go there for breakfast. 

First of all, service was mediocre - had to wait about 15 minutes to order. Waited another good 20 minutes for our food, that wasn't all that great: hash brows were soggy (like they were dipped on water and then served), pancakes weren't cooked long enough (tasted like raw batter)  and Maple BLT sandwich was nothing special. 

STAY AWAY.

Decided to give Thai Express a try after walking by many times during my lunch breaks @ Suncor Centre. 

Jason is right about the lineups - be prepare to wait for about 10 minutes or so during the 'lunch rush', but it is totally worth it. Been there two times, had the yellow curry shrimp and the cashew nut beef stirfry - in both times they were delicious and tasted really fresh. Prices are fair: portions are HUGE - reason why I always get the take away box, I'm never able to finish the whole thing. Highly recommended!

I travel for work throughout the US and for pleasure to Europe. Finding good food experiences is a primary goal. H&H is outstanding. From the bone in ribeye, smashed fingerlings and creamed black kale to the grouper, the shrimp cocktail to the bittersweet chocolate almond brownie and espresso ice cream dessert every bite from beginning to end was a great experience. Our waitstaff was great and Michael made it all a delight. And I must mention the cocktails.  Black Flag is a bourbon lovers delight, Gin & Juice a delight. Go H&H. We will return! ( smoking is an art and H&H hits that sweet spot perfectly )
PS: sat at the last table past the kitchen and liked it fine.

Absolutely the worst. After paying for an $50 estimate, Joe, the owner, refused to send me a copy of the estimate, refused to answer his phone, refused to return my messages. I paid immediately, yet this joker flat out refused to give me what I paid for. If this is how he handles an estimate, imagine how he would handle an actual job. I cannot say how much I distrust this guy and I would never recommend him to anyone.

THE PLACE IS TRASH.

Too bad I actually have to give this garbage dump a star. Living at Daybreak Gardens is akin to living in a dumpster surrounded by gangsters and roaches. I have come to realize that they have trashy people living here, trashy people running the place, so it's perfect for trashy living. 

Don't be foolish enough to call and complain about anything like drugs or your neighbors threatening you by yelling at you through your windows. Nothing is their responsibility. I mean nothing. Drugs are acceptable. Violence is acceptable. Really, any kind of ghetto behavior is acceptable. 

Be prepared to call the police for any kind of help because the management wants the place to be run down and full of thugs. And believe me, it is. The place is trash.

We had our Labradoodle puppy spayed and microchipped a few days ago at PAWS. The cost of having her spayed alone at our Vet office in Fountain Hills was going to START at $370.00!!!!! We decided to look around, and thank GOODNESS we found PAWS!!! The office was immaculate, and the staff was VERY friendly and knowledgeable! Dr. Fisher was kind and treated Frankie exactly how you would want your pet to be treated. Our experience was great, and we were able to have Frankie Spayed AND microchipped for a LOT less money!! We saved OVER $200 by going to PAWS!!!! We have, and will continue to recommend PAWS to anyone we talk to!

Todd redirected our car with transmission problems to a disreputable place because he couldn't find out what was wrong with it. We spent thousands and months trying to get it to run only to find out in the end it was a sensor. Still went back to him. The last time that we went there he had our car for over week. We couldn't get a hold of him and when we did he said that they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the car. A few days later he said that they were still trying to figure it out. We called again and he said that they couldn't find our car keys. We were very upset and went to talk with them about it but no one was there. We looked under the rock where we had left them because we had left it there when they were closed, and the keys were still there and had not ever been moved. He had not ever looked at our car and lied about the whole thing, keeping our car from us that whole time. We took the car without ever talking to him about it and he never called to tell us that it was missing. We took it next door to A and B motors and it was a simple problem and had it back in one day.

This is not our first time to Playdium and I were very hesitant to go. I do not enjoy very much busy and loud places and this is how I remembered Playdium from our previous visits.
However Friday 4 pm there were hardly any customers and very little noise and we enjoyed watching kids go from arcade to arcade.
I liked how you can pay flat 50 dollars you want to spend there and split it between as many people as you want. 
I am not an arcade fan by all means but I did enjoy racing my 18years old and watching  my 14 month old 'stomp the ball'.
it got busier towards evening so we just left.
Give it a try, it could be fun once in a while!

What an upsetting experience! Went with kids, paid over $40 and came out very disappointed, with the crying daughter because she were not allowed to re-enter to finish her round. Not even it's not worth the money but also I got  sick treatment from the stuff members.
Member stuff Rosie made my youngest daughter upset by allowing he re-enter not finished course first and refusing it 2 minutes later when male stuff member suggested 'it's too packed'. Little one burst in tears and Rosie would mentor her on how 'many tries she did on each hole as it is only allowed 6 tries'. Ridiculous and rude. My youngest daughter is just 6 years old!
We left with upset children and ruined mood.
I would not recommend to anyone with the kids go there.
By the end of the day it's about having fun together, not to ruin your night.

Wow! I loved the place! Very intelligent and romantic place. I liked both food and service. I had kale salad and chicken, my hubby had mushroom ravioli. My food was outstanding and my hubby liked his main. 
We had very nice and quite dinner. Music was outstanding. It is very appreciated that most of the patrons here to appreciate music and atmosphere.
However if I had one word to say it would be to very loud party of 3 who were seated next to musicians Friday night towards the end of the show. has nothing to do with restaurant performance thought. Some people just don't know their manners.

We have used this cleaners for over a year and overall have been pleased with cleaning and service. There have been a few items not cleaned well but overall good. Today, I was leaving off a load of cleaning. I also returned a good dress of my wife that I picked up from our last visit.  The zipper came back broken.  I brought that to the attention of the woman staffing the cleaners. Her immediate response , which was hostile, was that they can't fix the zipper they broke. It would have to be sent out and was too expensive so she would not help. She even suggested that we broke the zipper. I picked up my clothes and left.  They have lost a customer and I will not return. In fact, this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review on any business.  VERY disappointed.

I cracked my iPhone 5 screen while visiting a friend in Vegas from LA. Since I was so far away from home, I was scared that I was going to get ripped off in Vegas. Luckily, I found Willy's shop on yelp and guess what? His prices were even lower than repair shops in LA. He charged $60 for my cracked iPhone 5 screen and it was fixed in 10 minutes! I am very impressed with his work and will definitely tell my friends and family about it. This is THE lowest price in town guaranteed!

I was a big fan of Wet N Wild the two times I have previously been here until now!! My family of 6 drove 3 hours to this park over the weekend for my son's 6th birthday. We spent most of our time at Boogie Board Beach and all I can think about is how disgusting the water smelled!!! I wish the manger could get in the water to come out and smell the scent of mildew all over your body!!! At first when I got in the water with my son I smelled my shirt thinking it was just that, and suddenly my brother comes out of the water smelling the same !! The entire day there I was focused on how I smelled the entire time. I smelled like a dirty wet towel!!! I quickly told my son to get out of the water for fear of a possible contamination of some sort! The next day I got diarrhea and was worried it was that water especially after reading this past week's reviews about a crypto outbreak!!! They really need to dump out that water and fill it with new water before someone becomes extremely sick !! Not only this but the teens that work there are extremely irresponsible !! One of them even scolded my child for going down the water slide before the next kid got off completely so they ended up crashing !! That was completely the girl's fault that had told him to go down in the first place !!! Never coming back here again !!

I'm not a frequent guest of the Marriott chain, but I thought the JW of the brand was supposed to be their top of the line. My stay in early April was pleasant enough, but not special enough that I would stay at the property in the future or recommend it to others. 

Public facilities: The main lobby and Spa Tower seem to be in better shape than the Palm Tower where my room was located. Nothing that evoked "ooohs and aaahs" but nice enough. There were parts of the common areas that were dated and could use updating as was apparent in the Palm Tower. One thing that another poster mentioned that I also found to be odd was the lack of any hotel staff in the Palm Tower. During my 3 night stay I think I saw someone at the desk one evening but that was it. To have to walk through the smoky casino to the main lobby to talk to a hotel staff member was just weird to me. The grounds are nicely kept and while the weather during my stay was less than desirable, the pool area looked nice, too. The parking (valet and self) is free and plentiful so if you have a rental, that's a perk.  

Rooms: I will say the room/bathroom are really large. Having a foyer like entrance, large spaces, a walk in closet, seating, and a door to open to the outside (though an obstructed view)  I liked having space to spread out and a nice walk in closet to store my things (along with a safe). The bed was a bit on the lumpy side though and I did find is difficult to get comfortable. The bathroom Jacuzzi tub was nice and I liked the layout, counter space, and robes too. The one thing that I found strange was the lack of a place to put things in the shower. Strange to have no shelf so I just put my bottles on the floor of the shower.

Onsite restaurants/room service: While staying on property I tried the Promenade Cafe for lunch (sub par), Irish Pub for drinks/apps (decent), Starbucks for morning coffee (good), and room service for breakfast (good). Nothing stands out as being amazing but it was definitely nice to have a coffee option. The fees associated with room service seemed higher than most places I have stayed recently but it was a treat and provided me with a nice chunk of "me" time. 

Spa: See review on Spa Aquae's Yelp page. 

Location: Yes it's 20 minutes to the Strip but for someone who has already stayed on the Strip in the past, I don't feel like I missed out at all. It's actually nice being on the outskirts and seeing the views around the hotel was a pleasant experience. I did have a rental car so I was able to come and go as I pleased and not have to rely on any taxis or shuttle services. 

Bottom line: Would I stay again? Probably not. There are so many other places to stay in the area that I would want to try someplace new and more updated for the price you pay.

Decent store, clean. Decent service, nothing exceptional. (Better everday prices at fancy Fry's on Shea). Usually come here when they have a sale for something specific, like $0.99 eggs.

Last 2 times here were the worst. Hubby and I bought coffee one morning (one small, one medium). Had to repeat order multiple times at the drive thru, again multiple times at the window. Took a sip a few minutes later and it was a combination of burned, bitter, and sour. He got sick and threw up.

Thought it was a one time off day, came back another afternoon for 2 ice blended drinks (one with whip no boba, another boba no whip). Again, had to repeat order several times at drive through and again at window. Long wait at window and woman immediately closed it leaving the clipboard with me, knocked, no answer, honked, no answer, I finally opened the window myself and THEY were irritated that I was returning THEIR clipboard. Ridiculous.

Superb, honest, fairly priced service. Every. Time. We've been coming here since 2007. Prior to that our vehicle kept having one issue after another.  They tool a look, replaced a part and all of a sudden our car troubles ended.  We have been loyal customers since.

They are always so friendly and professional. They get to the point without the BS other car shops give you.

Call ahead to reserve a spot, depending on where you live, they can have someone bring you back home. You van also schedule it so you can wait for your vehicle. They're happy to work with you.

THIS is customer service. Was greeted at the door and treated like a person, not a number, not a sale - throughout the transaction.  Vanessa is WONDERFUL, KIND, the ABSOLUTE BEST. She was super attentive and honest enough to admit it when she didn't know the answer off the top of her head, quick to find the answers to the questions I had. AND she addressed my son who wanted the phone upgrade. 

Even though they closed at 8 and I said it was ok to not finish file transfers, I never saw any frown/change in expressions (from her or the rest of the staff), she remained sweet and pleasant. Thankfully, we walked out the door before 8:10. (I hate being the last customer anywhere, people should be able to go home on time). THANK YOU for the best service!

THE cure for teen AND tween angst. (At least for the duration of the show). My children are tough spectators and I saw all their smiling teeth from the end of the row. We enjoyed the show, appreciated the variety....music, magic, dancing, bit of comedy.

Clearly we were not the only ones because...looking around, I saw about 80% of guests (of literally all ages) at the edge of their seats. Definitely a lot of 'wows' from the crowd too.

I love the intimate theater, made the whole show more personal. I won't tell you everything that happens, but it's pretty amazing!

Whether you come feeling blah, upset, irritated. or happy, you're going to leave with a smile, because that's how entertaining is.

Came here for one of the school 'book fairs' to get school books for kids. Last 2 years have been ok-good.  Books were arranged per grade and most of the books were on tables. This year, terrible. Literally half the books were on the floor, under tables, some book covers were wet with who knows what. 

3 people pretended not to hear me trying to ask a question and kept walking. Another elderly lady glared before I could even approach. One did stop to answer a question  because I blocked his parh(where are the books located?since they usually have the books in 1 area). Apparently by the windows and books are in no order, I'd have the find them myself because, again, books are in no particular order and he promptly walked away.

Books were a mess, from K-12 with no particular rhyme or reason and one parent who dared to ask 2 teenagers for help was told (we're just here to hang up posters). A third came and that parent asked her and she said she was only there for 'moral support.' More of the teen staff walked by looked at us 3 lost parents and proceeded to talk and walk away.

One lucky parent did get help from someone knowledgeable willing to help and he at least gave a general idea where certain grade level books were.

If it weren't for my lids' books, I'd never go here.

Been here 2x kinda slow service. Once at half capacity
 and full capacity at the venue. Slow service the 1st time. Molasses speed the second time since it was packed. Suggest scheduling more servers for a more popular comedian on a long weekend - just sayin.'  Kudos to the nice ladies who greeted, seated, and served us tonight. More upbeat than the 1st time we were there.

If there's a good comedian scheduled, we'd come back again and hope for faster service.

3 because it was pretty warm inside.

We've come here for years and decided to try restaurant week. Little longer wait than usual (2 minutes instead of right away to be seated) because of the dinner rush hour on a long weekend during restaurant week. Boo hoo right?! lol I say it's still great service.

Place was full but our server was awesome! Super friendly and patient. I love to observe if servers treat their customers the same way and he did, super nice to all the groups. Took the time to explain the dessert options. KUDOS! 

The food? Always top notch. Cheese crisp, pizza norteña, and of course chips and AMAZING salsa. No room for all the sopapillas and to die for ice cream, but we took it home and kids devoured it.

I'm not a fan of tequila in general but the skinny margarita was strong and frozen melon margarita went really well with our meal. 2 days left for restaurant week. Go have some fun and eat wonderful food.

BUT, we always have fun when we come here and the Groupon for this is great!

Yesterday I took my precious Nahla in for an appointment that I had made regarding allergy treatment.  She was having a moderate reaction ... and I was concerned about how I should handle the next step.  They give technician support with allergy shot treatment and Dani came out into the lobby to talk with me.  She spent a few minutes explaining that some of the allergy shots might cause a flare up etc.

They attempted to save me the Doctor exam fee by having Dani the technician / nurse talk with me about the follow up care. I was adamant about having Dr. Hillebrand examine my dog and told them that I wanted the doctor to look at Nahla's eyes and into her ears.  I was a bit emotional and somewhat curt due to a disability that I have and certainly not intentionally toward the staff but afterward I realized it. 

I've taken my precious Nahla here for the past couple of months and I can't say "thank you" and how much "I appreciate" the staff here enough.  Every time I've been here if I ask a question about anything I either get a direct answer or the staff member will tell me that they're not sure but they'll find out.  That's super impressive to me because my questions always get answered.  Some veterinarians might play politics and/or place the blame on the client and/or others, not here.  What I've found here is conscientious people on all levels of the staff who works here.  They know dogs ....    

Dr. Hillebrand did the examination .. made a couple of suggestions and I left with some medicine.  Yesterday Dr. Hillebrand could have suggested a steroid shot and/or any other more expensive treatment.  BUT he didn't ... instead he dissuaded me from thinking about an instant solution.  With his suggestions and the $12.00 medication Nahla is so much better this morning.  She slept good last night and woke up perky this morning.  I'm pretty shocked at some of the negative reviews on here ..... this Animal Hospital lives up to it's motto .. they really do treat pets like family.  Thank you Dani, Dr. Hillebrand, Amanda, Jennifer and the rest of the staff.  I'm happy that Nahla and I found Dreaming Summit Animal Hospital  .........

I shop here often.  The first time in this store more than a year ago I noticed the cleanliness of the store, the friendly and well educated staff.  If you ask one staff member a question about something that they are not 100% certain about .. they'll ask one of their other team members.  They've answered questions about wine, scotch, cigars etc. and every time ... the answer I was given was correct. Consistency ... :)

If you don't like a product ... bring the remaining back and you get either a refund or an in store credit.  With a gaurantee like that .. combined with intelligent answers, wine tastings, scotch classes .. in their modern top of the line classroom in back of the store ... WHY would you shop anyplace else?  I love this store ... thank you Total Wine and More!

Retail businesses can't make every single customer happy.  All of us come from unique backgrounds in DNA, upbringing, individual wants and needs etc ....

If you want you want to get away from the strip this is the hotel for you. 

Pros: Free parking garage and Hash house a-go-go Restaurant (better than the one on the strip and lines are way shorter). 

Cons: Deposit fee and check-in. We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights which was ~$300. But once you check-in its additional $50 per night deposit fee they charge on the card you used to booked the hotel with. So actually at the end of the stay my total card was charged $400. But after 5-7 days I was reimbursed the $50 per night, so $100. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you plan on staying for more than 3 days. I also heard from one of the hotel guest instead of charging the $50 per night deposit at check-in you can give $200 cash for whatever nights you are staying  and when you check out you get the $200 cash right away. 


There's also check-in/out kiosk. In which people didn't use, so there was a long long line for the hotel registration.

Food is okay- problem is they need some adult supervision in there . I think they are understaffed or the staff they have need better guidance - had to ask for silverware (none in container on table) had to ask for more coffee , wait time after ordering extraordinarily long-food was cold.

Burgers are good but that's what you expect with bobbys name on the door. The place was pretty empty with about 10 customers and about 12 employees just standing around. 
The service was less than mediocre. Brianna who brought our food knocked my sons drink all over him and didn't have the courtesy to apologize. In fact she said she didn't do it when clearly she did if other customers said they saw her do it. It was obvious that there wasn't supervisor presence in the establishment. It's going to take customer service for this place to survive on the strip. You get what you pay for here. Good burgers and no customer service. This proves it is is hard to find good help! I expect more from bobby flay.

We reserved a Bollywood private dance class to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff were very nice and friendly and gave us an acceptable rate. The instructor was half an hour late so to compensate they gave us more time and charged us almost half the rate. The next day they also sent an apology email which was very sweet and professional from their side! The instructor was fun and flexible. We all had a great time and would definitely refer them.

I was gifted a visit to eye stop for myself and my daughter and was able to get eye exams as well as 2 pairs of glasses each.  I had read the previous YELP reviews and was a bit apprehensive when I was setting the appointments.  Suzanne answered the phone and was really personable.  She was just like the review had said, a positive in the experience.  She was able to set us appointments right away that worked for our schedule.
The following day we went to the location and were greeted by a gentleman and instructed how to fill out paperwork.  We had plenty of time to look over frames and although the selection wasn't my particular taste, there were plenty of current styles  to choose from.  The eye exam went off without a hitch, the dr was friendly and efficient and it was done quickly.  After the exam we were given more time to look at frames and Suzanne made suggestions.  We settled on our choices and were offered the option of extras but happily, I didnt feel pressured.
All in all, it was a very nice experience and I would definitely recommend this location.

My 20 year old daughter was referred to this office by a friend and what a great referral.  We visited this office on a Thursday to inquire about wisdom tooth extraction and found a very welcoming Staff.  Sandy at the front desk was very friendly and informative.  Not only did she make us feel comfortable, she told us quite a bit about the Dentist.  Being that my daughter has always suffered from dental anxiety, it immediately put her at ease.  The young ladies that did her x-rays and initial exam were also quite lovely and did not make her feel uncomfortable or self conscious and she was very relaxed during the cleaning.  The Dentist is soft spoken, kind and very articulate.  He explained the procedure and the risks as well as the benefits.  What a great Dentist!!  She scheduled the appointment for the following day and had ALL 4 removed at once.  Previously she had never had dental work without sedation and she was so at ease that she was able to move forward with none. This is huge considering how fearful she was walking in that door.  I was so impressed.

I highly recommend this Dentist, this office and this Staff as a whole.  Thank you Central Valley Dentistry.  We look forward to future visits.

I would absolutely recommend to any of you in the Phoenix Metro area that you choose this discount tire when in need : )

My daughter began taking classes at Encore 6 years ago.  At the time she had a bit of an attitude and didn't do too well with other girls.  She instantly fell in love with Regina and took numerous classes from hip hop (her first choice) to ballet, jazz, and lyrical.  I watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer.  Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem.  My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes.  Encore is not JUST family owned, it is a family environment.  I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants.  I couldn't recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns.  My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now.  I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family.

Every time I come here to buy pure balance dog food, they NEVER have the flavor/kind I need. Also, the fish department is very poorly taken care of. Don't sell living things if you are not going to properly care for them as needed. The Fish are over fed which can kill them, and their tanks look super dirty. Sure they are just fish, but I don't see the need to sell them if you are not going to take care of them correctly. You're selling people sick fish which isn't fair to the fish nor the people. It's a disgrace

TAKE CARE OF YOUR FISH OR DONT SELL THEM. Those tanks were so dirty a plant that was once green was covered in black gunk, so much food it could feed 20 fish when there was only 2 fish in there( overfeeding kills the fish). I get they are just fish, but it takes a bit of work to keep them healthy.... Shame on this place. Now this is the second Walmart that I've been to with the fish area not taken care of whatsoever. Will be calling corporate today.

The food is great.. But I feel like the service and quality has gone down since I came here a couple months ago. Food took a lot longer than the last time. They seem really short staffed for a Saturday night. Couldn't even get a Togo box for my pizza.. Got offered a piece of foil instead.. Love this place but I just feel if they tried a little harder to make the guests happy; they would get better business.

I went in today to deposit some cash into the ATM. After I was done I needed a $100 dollar bill to be broken but the lady told me she was unable to do that... UHM, you're a bank that I pay to use and you can't break my money? What am I paying a monthly fee for then? to store my money? I can do that under my mattress for free. It really irritates me that I have to go completely out of my way to break my money( and spend unnecessary money to break it)when my bank should do that for me. You know, since you're a bank, A PLACE FOR MONEY. Absolutely ridiculous

This place has gotten too picky. Brought items in the other day and they didn't accept anything. Brought in a couple pairs of almost brand new VS yoga pants, nice miss me jeans and stitched jeans. I can understand them not wanting my more basic items.. But the reasoning for the jeans? "Bootcuts don't sell". Pretty sure not everyone wears skinny jeans!! Now I'm selling my items on Facebook for more than they would've given me :) you guys will eventually lose all your business due to being beyond cheap with your buying and being extremely picky.

Love that it is hidden away from the other ramen houses on spring mountain. Food is tasty,  I like the shoyu broth but have also enjoyed miso. My son loves the curry,  has good flavor just no potatoes with it.  Doesn't stop him from ordering it everytime. Prices are great, doesn't hurt your pocket.  Atmosphere is nice and cozy,  small like other ramen spots but never crowded when we come so not stuffy.

Went there for Mother's day,  party of 3 around 9pm. First time customers, we all did the AYCE. Sushi and side dishes came out pretty quick.  Side dishes were great,  sushi was good but I've had better. My son didn't care for the uni,  as it is one of his favorites. Just the quality and lack of taste wasn't up to par for him. He ordered one of the rolls with crunchies but it tasted stale. My husband who likes spicy sms hot couldn't handle the 911 roll. The spicy tuna was great but it was an even toss up of good and not so good rolls.
No sashimi (but most ayce don't have), No raw oysters (again usually you don't see that for ayce). That's okay I have my favorite spot where I get both in the ayce. 
I love sweets and the bonus is that you are not limited to one dessert only.  So I really enjoyed the lychee sorbet,  mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream.
The service was good, around enough to take orders and clear plates.  They just never offer refills,  even when our cup is empty we had to ask for the refills. 
I would go back,  but not a big deal if I don't make it.

You can never go wrong with the bulgogi nachos.  The chips are always crisp,  toppings are plentiful and portion size will fill you up. The fusion beef sliders with fries are great. Who knew a bulgogi cheesesteak would be so delicious, they did that's why it's on the menu. I love getting the pork belly skewers as an appetizer. I always leave full and satisfied with some leftovers to take home.

Second time at this location and it was horrible. I work in the restaurant industry so it usually takes a lot of wrongs for me to think service sucks. Upon arrival not more than 10 tables in the entire restaurant and got sat promptly. After 4 minutes of server (Tara) not even stopping by to greet us, I asked the first person who walked by (happen to be the manager) if we could get a server to offer us drinks. He took our drink order and she finally rolled up right before he delivered the drinks. We were ready to order so she took our order and for as slow as it was it took 26 minutes for our food to come out. She asked if we needed anything and we said no, but after a few bites into our meal we noticed my son didn't have all the condiments that came with his fajita dish so we waited a bit, then looked around and saw one server tending to her tables and our server nowhere to be found. I asked the other server in passing if she could get our server but instead she offered to get the missing condiments. As always server came by just a little to late. After finishing our meal I was looking around at an even slower restaurant with fewer tables and our server nowhere to be found again. Went up to the cashier, paid the bill and of course as we were leaving here came the server always a minute behind. Not sure if she was doing side work, eating, taking a break or just hiding but it's sad that every time I looked around the restaurant she was almost nowhere to be seen. I guess my problem is if you're that slow there's no excuse for poor service which is exactly what I felt I received. 
To be honest this location is 3 minutes from my house, but I'd rather drive further to the Tropicana location for better service and food.

Found this spot right around the corner from my house. It was a quick stop for my son's breakfast before school. Didn't have time to review the menu but my son wanted some bacon, eggs and pancakes. We ordered the super breakfast combo which is 3 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage patty, pancakes and hash brown or fruit. We upgraded the pancakes to the banana nut and substituted rice instead of hash browns. Portion size was huge, my son and I shared and took home some of the leftover pancakes. The banana nut pancakes were great, you could taste the bananas and every few bites you got some nuts. For our first visit which was a quick stop we really enjoyed our breakfast and what we paid about $10. Plan to come back to check out more of the menu.

My 15 year old son had to have surgery and this location was referred to us by his surgeon. From our arrival, until his discharge we were completely impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the entire staff. They made him feel comfortable, walked him through the entire process of what to expect and was very thorough with his prep. It's amazing how with every patient they kind of have a check list of the same questions and although repetitive you never heard it in their tone. Instead they always sounded respectful and concerned while going through the process. They were helpful in answering all our questions and left us satisfied in sending off our son for his surgery. We even received a thank you card a few days later with all the staff's signed. 

Definitely  recommend for a safe, clean and professional experience for your surgery.

I know most Doctor appointments you spend most of your time sitting in the room waiting but we got here 20 minutes early.  Got pre screened by the nurse at our appt time which took about 10 minutes and now have been sitting in the room for an hour.  I had to write this review before seeing the Doctor because this is incredibly ridiculous to sit here as a new patient and if I'm lucky by the end of it all get 5 minutes of his time. At this point,  I suggest finding another Doctor.  This is all based on everything prior to seeing the Doctor.  I waited so long,  why not write the review in the exam room.

Food still taste great, service could be better. Came here at 8am. 4 tables and me. They seem to have a full staff, cashier, busser and servers at least 4 of them, so why is the guy next to me waving for attention because his coffee cup is empty and I noticed it was like that for a good while. At one point, not one employee was in the front of the house. Oh well, again the food was good but they specialize in red velvet so how can it not be.   Minus one star for service that could have been a little better.

As a family of 3 we usually do a 3 combo meal (2 orders of spare ribs and 1 order beef brisket and the 2 sides baked beans and potato salad). Never fails that the spare ribs are always soft and easily fall off the bone.  The meat is so tender and flavorful perfect for me.  My husband and son love sauce and will usually add more barbecue or hot sauce for themselves. The beef brisket is always tender and never chewy where you can't get it down. This usually fills us up,  if we have a bigger appetite we might order more beef brisket or the barbecue chicken.  Sometimes they have special sides like the dirty rice which my family love. We usually visit on Sundays for some barbecue and Ricky is always there to help take care of us.

Joined them for national pancake day. Walked in and was lucky enough to get a table right away. Our waitress came by to offer drinks and we ordered the free pancakes at the same time. Restaurant was full with a wait growing shortly after we got sat. We started to notice tables were walking in and getting their pancakes under 5 minutes while we sat there for 20 minutes looking around. Noticed I didn't see our waitress, stopped the waiter walking by  and asked him about our waitress, when still no one came asked another waiter Ansiem for the manager. He asked how he could help and when we asked about our waitress and our order, he went straight to the kitchen grabbed our order, delivered and apologized for her leaving without notice. He continued to check in on us and made sure we were okay. Thanks to Ansiem he made our experience the best we've  had at any ihop location.

The Hawaiian plate was okay.  Kalua pig was good,  lau lau was a little dry,  squid luau didn't have the sweet coconut taste and the luau leaf wasn't cooked long enough. The lomi lomi salmon tasted great, Mac salad had enough mayo,  poke was good but I've had better.  I wouldn't try the Hawaiian plate again but I did try the Mahimahi sandwich and it was crispy in the outside and moist in the inside.  Quality is average.  I would eat there again. I just wouldn't go out of my way to visit.  I still have other local Hawaiian food spots that I take family and friends when visiting.

Had lunch here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  Hidden in the lakes,  a gaming lounge with separate dining area.  Dark and cozy,  small dining area with one server and one busser. I had their corned beef and cabbage with Irish potatoes and carrots.  It was served with soup or salad.  Portion size was hefty as I took home a third of it for later.  The corned beef had a lot of flavor and the sides were soft not mushy.  My husband had the prime rib dip which included some green peppers and onions to add for a more flavorful sandwich.  It came with sweet potato tater tots which was delicious.  Service was fast and friendly and the gaming side looked rather busy too.  We will definitely be back.

This place is awesome! I love the "No Harm Chicken Parm" and their soynamis are delicious. Best vegetarian/vegan place I've been to in Arizona by far. It can get super crowded though, but that just goes to show you how good the food is.

Tried to eat here three times during a convention at the hotel, it was way too crowded and we couldn't find a seat. Staff didn't try to help or acknowledge us for a good 15 minutes that we wandered around looking for a table. They should at least change the whole "seat yourself" concept during a convention that thousands of people attend, doesn't work well.

The apartments themselves are nice inside, very cute actually. We've had problems with the washer/dryer/AC but maintenance did fix the major things. We did have problems with the office staff, but I feel the issues have been resolved. I had previously written a review about how displeased I had been with the office, the manager reached out to me and explained the situation. I can tell the manager does care about tenants, I definitely respect that. Overall, it is a nice place to live.

All About Beautiful Smiles dental is my family's dental provider.  The appointment availability are great which is why my kids go here as well.  The staff are funny, nice and welcoming.  Dr. Phen is very nice and very detailed on what needs to be done.  From prior experience some dentist just recommend unnecessary things  to have you spend $ but Dr. Phen is honest and truly cares about his patients.  As long as I'm living in Nevada All About Beautiful Smiles will be mine and my family's dental provider.  I truly recommend them!

I can't understand all the negative reviews. I have lived here since November, 2016. The first thing that got my attention was that it not only is it gated, but it's guard gated. Yep, a real live guard, 24/7. Security is important to me and I have never seen any unusual activity here. The grounds are well maintained, the office staff Is great, and the office is open 7 days, 9 to 6. Maintenance is also available 7 days. They are quick to respond and usually resolve whatever the issue is the same day or next day. The units themselves are great. I have a 2 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath, 2 story with a good size 2 car garage. The utilities are reasonable. My biggest gas bill was $42 in December and my electric bill for May was about $45. The rent is the best part for me. I don't know where else I could go and have a nice size apartment with a two car garage in a guard gated community. Plus, it's pet friendly. If you're seriously looking, it's worth your time to check it out. Might be the best place for you. It was for me.

I hadn't eaten at Egg and I for a few years. My friend and I needed a restaurant the other day and we were close to Egg and I. The place was very busy - a good sign. We were seated right away and the server, Tamara, was great. The food also turned out to be great. All in all, a great experience. I'm sure I will eat there a few times a month. Highly recommended.

I don't usually give 5 star reviews but I based this on the food, the service, and whether or not I would go back. It's been years since I visited a Red Robin. I went there a few weeks ago and I had a great hamburger and the service was great.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.

I have used Cox for most of the last 30 years for two reasons: no contract, and they seemed to be the best of the worst. However, every year they seem to reach a new low. Currently I cannot access my account online because it won't let me login. I've talked to over 20 people over the last two months. They finally started to send me my bill in the mail so I could see it and pay it. Now, I can't access Contour online for the same reason; I can't login..... and there's more. The Contour voice command seldom works unless you unplug the box and let it reset. The whole system will shut down at anytime, reboot itself, and come back on. It will also freeze and do the same thing. Coming back on can take 5, 10, 15 minutes, whatever. They also require you to have a landline to get a lower price. I have a landline that I have no use for - I don't even know what the number is and there is no telephone attached to it - because I got a lower price if I took it. I have shown the tech guys - who show up every now and then -  features they were unaware of. I could relate lots of stories of bumbling, ineptness, and just plain old "they don't have a clue about what what's going on." But, there is something that I do like. The illuminated remote control!  I'll be switching soon - probably to DirectTV for television service and LV.net for internet service. I know that both provide better service than Cox.

We are from out of town and came due to the number of reviews and ratings. I'm not sure if I like this... despite this I was not disappointed. We just ordered the 5 different meat platters for 6 people. We came in on a Monday afternoon and had to wait for 30min...due to limited large table seating. We just asked to sit in a small booth and squeeze in, which they allowed. Service was okay.

Long time lurker, newbie poster. Decided to start to post due to the disappointment with this restaurant. 

Got the $50 prefix menu, also used the Costco gift certs... so definitely a great great value. Value:5 Star 

Location: Just plain weird, had to triple check the address on the navi to make sure we arrived at the right location. Location: 2 star 

Decor: No bad.. not great, although the open kitchen was both a plus and minus. Very interactive and fun with the... but the smell of the grill and some of the seafood was just overwhelming at certain times. Our clothing smelled semi-fishy from sitting at a table so close to the kitchen. 
Decor/layout: 3 star. 

Food: Major bummer. Let me just say, I never had rosemary's, I got nothing against them. Perhaps my expectation was too high... the food just didn't do it for me. 

-Hugo's BBQ shrimp and blue cheese slaw: Too salty, over cooked stiff shrimp. 
-Duo tar tar: Nicely done 
-Scallops and the Halibut were the best dishes of the night. Very Good 
-Meats were a major disappointment. 
The Veal Porter house was very tender but tasteless, very salty on the outside, but very bland on the inside. 
Rack of lamb were not bad, but not great either, portions were very small too. 
For dessert, we got the chocolate cream pie (very good), apple tart (very good), Bread pudding (super bad.... tasted like a doughy sponge... no we didn't finish it) and banana cheese cake (way too sweet). Over all food: 3 Star 

Service: Wonderful. We didn't have the heart to complain about the less than stellar taste to such wonder servers. 

Over all Rosemary's is not a bad restaurant, but I don't think it deserves the 4.5 star rating on yelp. Maybe they just had a off night, maybe my expectations were to high. We're from Calif, having to convince my wife and in laws to drive off the strip to eat at a 4.5 yelped restaurant for some delicious fine dinning... we were disappointed.

Its was ok. I got the sausage meatballs and Arrabiata sauce. Needed more sauce. Spaghetti noodles appeared to be round, although the description said square. Friend got the Uncle Arthur meatballs with same sauce and noodles. She said hers were just "ok" as well.  Price point a little high. We bought this as a take out order. Might be better eating it in resturant. Walked in to pick up food and resturant was nice, clean, open. With the open space, the music was quite loud, and sounded like heavy metal. Didnt gel with atmosphere.

Dinner and salad was amazing. He also enhanced my pasta with some spicy jalapeño olive oil. A lively experience with excellent food.

This is another pretty good Mexican restaurant in the champaign area. It is usually never too busy, so you don't have to wait to be seated. However the service is somewhat slow and not as attentive as I think it should be.

The chicken quesadilla is super yummy and definitely worth trying! I also participated in drinking a margorona while there with my friends. They're pretty darn big!! And are as tasty as the ones down in Mexico 

I will probably visit this restaurant again. Although I wouldn't say it's a place you have to try while in Champaign, it's not a bad place to get dinner with friends on a night out

This place is a nice place to grab lunch and has a very clean and comfortable atmosphere. You can basically pick/make anything to be a pasta, salad, panini. However, the quality control needs to be improved. Once I got frozen lettuce on my sandwich that had freezer burns. I can order the same exact custom thing twice, and it will taste quite different. Also, the cheesecake I got should have been better refrigerated. All in all, an okay restaurant to grab lunch at with friends with a good atmosphere. Control quality can be improved.

In life not everything goes perfectly, but if ever I have had an experience of people whole heartedly working to make things right, this was it.   Matt Melone was incredible and his manager Mike Jameson too.  

I flew to Arizona from Colorado to purchase a used Toyota Tacoma truck from Matt Melone.  Matt picked me up from the airport in the new truck.  It was a warm day and when I went to put up the air conditioner, it didn't function properly, it just blew air.   Immediately upon getting back to the dealership everyone went into high gear to fix the problem.  Matt took me to go get something to eat, and took care of the bill.  They ended up replacing a whole part, which couldn't be done until the following day, but they paid for a hotel room for me and offered to pay any expenses I might have, and they made sure I had breakfast.  They also provided me with a loaner car.   They even went so far as to pay for my hotel room in Flagstaff and offered to pay for my dinner too, that next night on my way back to Colorado.  They also reduced the purchase price to help us even further!  The reduction helped pay for my plane ticket out there, which was a wonderful and exceptionally thoughtful consideration.

They truly bent over backwards for me, and what could have been a complete nightmare, they did everything in their power to make it not so.   I saw that this dealership has had negative reviews in the past.  I asked Matt about this and he said that they have let go of everyone from the top to the down that was responsible for the poor running of the dealership.  New people have been brought in and they are determined to make this a great dealership.  This was exceedingly evident.

We need to get another car in the next few months, and we will be calling Matt Melone to help us find one.  It would be a pleasure to work with them again.  Thank you Camelback Ford!  Happy New Year!  

Warm regards, 
Ann Brumby

Great food great service. My wife and I had breakfast here over the weekend - coffee arrived at the table in record time and breakfast followed soon after. 

The portions for "the bunker" (corn beef hash) are large enough that we each had a midmorning snack later in the day.

We've been in a number of times over the years and I've always been glad that we've stopped.

food is okay. We have eaten here a few times, never really impressed with the service or the way the place was operated.

Our Last time in, we sat ourselves at a bar table, without help - big mistake. Note: no one was at the door to greet us, no sign stating "wait to be seated"... and we sat down in a not very busy bar area.

A waiter came over, greeted us and smacked the back of her hand into the palm of her other hand while shaking her head ~ letting us know we were wrong to have seated ourselves. A few minute later she dropped off menus and said "welcome to your first time eating at a restaurant" 

The first expression would have been "okay". The second was way over the top. On past visits the service has also appeared understaffed and not afraid to express their frustration.

We explained the poor service to the manager as we left, without eating. He appeared as interested in the details as we are in ever returning - not very!

Okay food. Consistently poor service.

We currently live here. 

Positives:
-The Maintenance crew are nice men.
-They keep the outside area tidy and do their job.
-The gate is finally closed at night. 
-The apartments are huge for the price you pay.
-The apartment is very close to Stephanie and if you like shopping, it's ideal. 

Negatives:
-Our car has had gas stolen 3 times. We finally had to buy a locked gas cap. The cap was stolen twice. 
-The police & firetrucks have showed up 3 times since we have lived here. It's only been a couple of months.
-Recently, they lost our rent money. Thankfully, we kept proof that we paid on the 1st. We received an eviction notice and were very confused. 

**Most of my negative feelings about this place are because of the tenants that live here. It's not really management's fault. You get what you pay for. It's a very low cost apartment in Henderson. If you stay in your apartment and keep to yourself, you will be fine. Keep your receipts though!! Good life lesson after reading this review.**

The father & daughter that run this place are very kind people. The daughter keeps everything extremely tidy. It can get crazy and crowded. Just know that at about noon, it always starts to slow down. I keep taking my kids back because it's a small area and I can watch them while sitting down and relaxing. There is a huge assortment of toys and it is worth the money if you stay for several hours.

I don't live in the area but was in town visiting relatives for the holidays.  Left my razor at home, so decided to do something I have wanted to do for years and get a shave at a barber shop.  The shave from roosters was well worth the 22 dollars, my skin feels great and it was an extremely relaxing 30 minutes.  The barber also gave me a couple of tips on what to do with my hair, which my barber at home has never bothered to mention.  My only gripe is that it seemed understaffed and I was seated 30 minutes after my appointment time, but I am willing to chalk this up to the holiday season. Recommend for the shave and would try the haircut if I lived in the area.

I went here with my family recently for a formal dinner to celebrate my dad receiving an award from the Lieutenant Governor's office. My family doesn't get all gussied up too often, so it was nice to have a reason to put on our best duds!

The food and service here were both very good. We all had appetizers and entrees, the former of which seemed more standout. The entrees were quite tasty but a little lacking in excitement; Half of our table had the crispy sea bass and the other half had the veal. We also ordered the soufflé to share which was really delicious and somewhat entertaining. I had never eaten one before, and was a little horrified when the waiter threw a glob of whipped cream on top and smushed it all up... until I realized that was how it's supposed to be served!

The service staff were very courteous and helpful. They were very considerate of our needs and questions, and I was also surprised to find that they had a good sense of humour! I expected the place to be much more stuffy than it was. 

Overall a very great spot for a special treat!

The ladies are both talented dancers (a pleasant surprise) and lovely to look at.  Some of the numbers were just too silly to enjoy but there were a handful that were amazing.  The new 19-year old they are making such a big deal of because she was a playboy centerfold was one of the weakest points - she's not much of a dancer so her pieces are meant to showcase how hot she is rolling around on stuff.  She IS cute - but those pieces were a total yawner.    My biggest complaint is actually about the facility.  HORRID seating (the chairs are about a 1/2 inch from each other - no leg room at all) and MGM clearly wants to gouge the heck out of you.   A plain old iced tea was $5 and beer started at something like $8 for a bottle of Bud.   Don't believe them when they tell you that you need to get there early - they just want you to get thirsty enough for an $8 Bud to make sense.  If you can get discount tickets, there are certainly worse ways to spend time in Vegas.

The food is very good and I really like the ambience.  Lots of choices for trying to eat vegetarian and they're willing to improvise the menu if there's something you want. I'm still not sure about it's location in Tivoli, which appears to be a shopping center with only restaurants (?).

I've lived in DC and Chicago, two great food towns.  There is no Thai place in either town that compares to this one. Tofu pad Thai makes being vegetarian worth it and picking your spicy level (1-10, 6 for me) is awesome. Authentic food for suThe lunch special is cheaper than Panda and a million times better. The service is not perky but that's part of the charm. Very small seating area and not much to look at, but get past that because you will love it! This will always be on my Vegas to do list when I return.

Pizza is so subjective, but this is my favorite pizza delivery in Vegas by far.  The ingredients all are good quality and it's cooked east coast style, so the crust is not too thick or thin.  Couple of other New York style places on the far west side in Summerlin, but this one is definitely better.  They don't skimp on the toppings either.  Also, the girl who took my order was friendly and competent and the delivery guy was courteous and friendly.

I have a love-hate relationship with Hash House.  It's always busy and I've ordered wrong before, but overall the good far outweighs the bad.  The one on Sahara is the only one I like.  They had a pork roast scramble special once that I still fantasize about, but for me, it's mostly about the breakfast and the PANCAKES.  The blueberry pancakes are good but the banana brown sugar are AMAZING.  If you like pancakes, they are the best and worth every penny.  The vanilla waffle is pretty blah.  The mashed potatoes are crazy good.

This was my nightmare home repair experience.  Everything I asked about was a $200 issue, including a toilet flapper replacement.  I ended up buying the $10 flapper myself and putting it in in about 5 minutes. I think the man who came thought I was someone who would just fearfully tell him to do $1000 in repairs.  These are like the car repair crooks you always hear about. I wasted $35 on the coupon but it would have been much worse if I had let that guy touch anything in my house.

This place is back up to snuff for me.  The trick if you're a pancake lover and picky is to ask for them to make them very thin. Improves the blueberry to batter ratio significantly and improves the taste.  The staff is much better than they were for a while. Back to loving it.

Went on a Friday night with one friend. Arrived around 9pm and we were lucky to get a table as the Canadians were playing on the TVs(in New Jersey against the Devils!). The atmosphere was super fun, especially with all of the hockey fans. Our food came super fast (everyone else was just ordering drinks at that time). The fish and chips were amazing, very high quality tasting fish :) 10/10 would come again :) Definitely a pub atmosphere and they had a good selection of draft beers. The place was very loud but that was to be expected with the game on.

I had just moved to Arizona last year and was desperate to find a hairdresser who was skilled at cutting short hair. I saw a woman in Whole Foods one day who had a really cool and hip short cut, and boldly asked her who cut her hair. She said 'I'm a hairdresser,' and instantly my connection with Christian was born. 

I have just read the other stellar reviews of Christian on this site, and found myself nodding and smiling in agreement with all of them. I will add that I have never in my life had a hairdresser who was so caring and concerned about understanding what I want for my hair, then working to give it to me and 'get it right.' Christian is a beautiful person, inside and out, and I feel as if my appoinments with her are also  visits with a friend. 

Not to mention that she is a kick-ass, super-talented stylist and my hair has never looked better! I was leaving the salon the other day after Christian did my hair and the next customer commented that I looked 'really hot!" Now that is the kind of compliment you want to hear after just having your hair done (especially when you're in your 50's!) Love, love, love!!!

Can't say enough how thrilled I am to have found Lisa and her service. My 89 year old mom lives alone and can't always get to the store, so will often run low on groceries. Living in another state, I am often frustrated about how I can help her. 

Enter Lisa, ta dah!! Not only did Lisa bring the groceries into the house for my mom, but offered to put them away for her!! Then followed up with a nice note to me to say 'mission accomplished'. I am so grateful Lisa - not only that your business exists but also for who you are as a person. Many thanks. I will be a repeat customer for sure and will spread the word!

We went to this place because I saw a used vehicle that I really liked and we were looking to get my payment down. Once inside it took 30 minutes to just talk to a sales person. Then he was a waste of time. He looked my car up on Kelly blue book and gave us a price that blew me away in a bad away. He said something about how they buy cars in bulk and then sell them but tells me they will give me 4,000$ less then the same car they are selling on their lot with more miles. The vibe we got was they had no time for us.

I absolutely love this place!! My family moved to Mount Holly in August and I wish so bad we would've found this place from the start! My 4 year old went to a daycare center and he really started to have alot of listening issues bc of the poor staffing at that center. But the staff at Early Beginnings stood by me and helped me every bit of the way! They offered me support, made me feel like family, and showed me options on how to help my child. As a mom, it isn't easy to admit your child needs help. But when you actually have the teachers standing with you and telling you it's going to be ok and they will help you....that means more than the world!!! My son woke up EVERY morning excited to go! He has only been there for 1 week but he is finally back to himself after 2 months :) thank you to ALL the staff at Early Beginnings!!

Everyone is always so nice and I never have a problem with any other dogs being mean towards mine. I also have a 4yr old and they have a play area for kids which he loves! There is an area with picnic tables that are covered near the trails. It's a very beautiful area and there are even geese at the lake area where u can fish too :) needless to say, I highly recommend this park for any occasion!

It was an overall unpleasant experience in the one year I lived here. Much of it stems from the fact that these apartments were built in the late 80's / early 90's and haven't kept up with the times. My apartment had a leaky A/C unit which would freeze up and drip down onto the carpet. That's exactly what you want during Arizona summers. I changed my air filter often, but the air vents are old and dirty and made me have respiratory problems. Management loves to provide little input or real change and instead just sends the maintenance guys who are able to do little to nothing for these old, troubled rental units.

Besides the units themselves, as I mentioned you'll get problems from management to add to it. Nothing topped off a day at work like coming home to see a note on my door that our entire building will have the water shutoff tomorrow starting at 5am until 5pm. I think this is just a little bit of short notice in the instance of "routine maintenance." I recall this happened at least three times, and once was actually due to the old pipes freezing up during a cold winter. Then when it came time to move out, it was a hassle and negotiation for my full deposit to be returned when it was due to existing problems, and they're making zero investment to renovate and remodel these old apartments. 

I understand you want to be near Old Town, but you can do better.

Take the bad reviews to heart, we didn't and got burned by it. You can do a lot better for the amount you are going to spend. Find a place that cares about your big day as much as you do. Superstition Manor only wants your money, and they aren't even willing to work that hard for it. Really pathetic experiences the more we got to know them. 

We spent a lot of money and made our wedding look good, but still got treated poorly, and worse our guests were treated poorly. It was like we worked for them and not the other way around. A $10K or even $20K+ event shouldn't be a DIY experience in which the staff is rude and a hinderance to pulling off the day the bride dreams of.

Now getting going, you've got much better places to look at!

Terrible customer service, really bad for Peter Piper. 

Our food took forever to arrive, and yet it wasn't all ready to be served with only half the order available. This was despite the lengthy wait and our buzzer going off to alert that our order was ready. No sufficient explanation or apology was given when the issue was brought up. The staff does not go above and beyond, or really even meet the standard expectations.

So all you're left with now is game machines for your kids, except those don't entirely work. Some had tokens jammed to render them inoperable, others simply didn't operate correctly. 

Very unfortunate family experience that won't be repeated.

I visited for the first time tonight after having driven by the restaurant many times on my way home. Truly a unique and delicious dining experience. If you want really good Chinese food, then come to Singing Pandas. I'm not much of a fan of Chinese food, and I thought the food here was worth repeat visits, and I'll now be bringing friends and family along to try it too. The staff is excellent with their customer service as well.

Why the friends and family comment? What really set this experience apart was the live entertainment; the "singing" is not just a clever name. There is great, live musical entertainment included with your dining experience from 6-8pm. 

In a friendly room with a full bar and tables to accommodate all party sizes, the dining lounge was one of a kind. I can't think of anywhere in AZ that you can get a great meal and see great local musical impersonations and performances, along with songs performed by the tremendously talented owner herself, all for a very reasonable price of dinner. Singing Pandas blows the pants off something you'd pay for at a casino or local theater when you factor in the quality plus the cost. 

Try Singing Pandas today, they even have a good sized and well kept parking lot so the whole experience is easy-going fun.

Very friendly staff, Heather was awesome and the owner, Dave, came out and visited. We were driving through Phoenix on our way back to Tucson from Sedona and the Grand Canyon and was looking for a place to stop on the north side to let the work traffic thin and found Caps on Yelp. The boneless mild wings were delicious. We had several salads and they were huge! Several ordered steaks and were pleased. Mom loved the grilled veggies and bonus was ladies night with $3.50 margaritas, Mai Tais and martinis! Glad we found it! Thanks Dave!

I attempted to rent a vehicle for a one way trip from Vegas to Cali. Reserved everything online with my debit card. I go to pick the vehicle and was told NOPE!! I have to have a major credit card which I don't have! Then I get a dumb ass excuse of why I can't use a debit card and then an employee wanted to see 2 copies of a bill from my home. WHAT?!! Are you fucking kidding me?!!! I'm treated like a criminal !! 
And to top it off, your employee was extremely rude. Her name is Justine. Not only was she rude to me and could care less about her job. She apparently also has a mouth of a sailor. F bombs flying everywhere. She needs a class on proper customer service and etiquette of how to be professional. Neither was her strong areas. I will NEVER EVER rent from this company!

I'm very upset about my experience at this location. I came in with my dog and was informed the dog could not be in the store. I informed the associate that the dog is my service dog. She still insisted the dog can not be in the store. Again, I stated that the dog is my service dog and offered to show her the dog's service dog card. Which she did not seem to care and proceeded to reiterate the dog can not be in the store due to the food. What this girl did is breaking the law. I can bring my dog in as long as I have her service dog card, which I had. But she didn't care. Your employees need to be aware of the ADA laws and rules. Clearly they are not. I will be calling the manager tomorrow when she gets in and filing a formal complaint. This is ridiculous and this girl needs know what animals are allowed and not allowed in the store. I'm furious and you've just lost a customer.

Fabulous family owned cafe within the Scottsdale Spectrum office complex on Scottsdale Rd. between Indian Bend and Lincoln. They opened this location about 8 years ago and they know all of their customers by name! Even after your first visit, they will remember you and know your name! I don't know how they do it!  I love their breakfast, they make the bacon perfect and crispy! Lunch specials vary by day and always consistently good. Mary Ellen bakes the most amazing cupcakes and cookies and coffee cakes. I have so many favorite cupcakes, but two of my all time faves are her red velvet, melts in your mouth and the newly created peanut butter chocolate. Has half a mini reeces peanut butter cup on top...mmmmm! Please stop in and support your local business! You will be so glad you did! I always leave there laughing!

This is an awesome hidden gem! I've worked right down the street for 10 years but never knew about this place until my uncle recently told me about it. I had the philly cheese steak with peppers and sauce and it was amazing ... and huge! I could only eat half. Great prices for so much delicious food! This is a great little family owned place that has been there for 34 years!!! (They had a big sign stating they just celebrated 34 years on 4/1/11)  It is a cash only restaurant, so make sure you stop at the ATM first. The chef's daughter offered me a sample of the chicken salad her dad makes there daily. It is amazing! They sell over 100 pounds of this a week! Just a really neat place, friendly people, and amazing food! I will definitely be back!

coming from a mechanical family, I'm very picky about those who touch my stuff, but these guys have my business.  met them through two friends who recommended them, and I'll continue to recommend them.  

These 2 have been working on my Bandit since I got the bike 20,000 miles ago, and it won't see another mechanic.

set up an appointment or call for emergencies they can always try to fit you in.  I've had Kyle pick up my bike 3 times now.

last stop in, Adam was nice enough to pull an H2R off the lift to stop and work on my bike, couldn't thank them enough.

These guyes are good!

This place was great. The wings were the best I had and the pizza had the most stretchy cheese. :) Always best eaten hot and never warm. ^^ I also liked the rice dishes. You won't be disappointed. 

The environment is more of an urban and youth theme. I really enjoy listening to the pop and kpop while enjoying my meal. The art was also nice too. A great place with friends and maybe dates ;)

The Fifth Grill and Terrace was rated on a blog as one of the best steaks in Toronto.  My husband and I were excited to go, especially because it also boasted a beautiful rooftop dining patio.  The experience was neat, as the entrance is an unmarked door in an alley and after being checked off the reservations list were escorted up an old industrial elevator to the top floor.  We had the place to ourselves which was a little weird at 6:30 on a Saturday night.  This meant our waitress was very attentive.  The wine list was short and expensive but did have a bottle of Canadian red which was delicious.  The food was very expensive as well and was fine, but not delicious and worth the cost ($50/main mean plus $7/side vegetables).  The salmon appetizer was very disappointing since it was just a couple slabs of cold salmon and no flavor profile.  The ambiance was very nice, though there is no view since it is squashed between taller buildings.

Ok, it's a Chipotle Mexican Grill. It's exactly like all the others, and the menu is the same.

That being said, it is inside a mall, and has a reasonably large and clean seating area outside the restaurant in the concourse. The food was good, and the staff was efficient and served promptly and hot. It is possible to get some variability in the freshness of the food and cleanliness of the location of course, and on both points this location was great.

The only reason I'm adding my review here, since I don't think every single Chipotle needs a review, is that it was one of my best meals in Vegas. The last time I was in Vegas it seemed a little easier to find something vegan. Especially in some of the $100+ per person restaurants, I'd expect the chef to be a bit more accommodating.

Anyway, two thumbs up (and five stars!) for finding a Chipotle convenient to my hotel, the Palazzo.

I went here with a group as part of a conference, and we were served a fixed menu. I'm vegan, and they were very accommodating, even though we weren't ordering off of the standard menu. The service was great, and the waiter said they'd bring me something. The salad was simple but the dressing was delicious, and the waiter came by twice to give me extra. The pasta was especially good, and was served with the largest head of broccoli that I've ever seen.

Great food, attentive service, and they wanted to make sure we were happy.

Disclaimer: This is a vegan's view

I expect most high-end restaurants to be able to put together something vegan, especially if you ask without regard to price. But after being seated here with a fairly large party, I asked what my options were for something vegan. I don't expect miracles, but in Carnevino, the waiter came back and said the chef would take care of me. I ended up with salad and some vegetables, but filling enough and very good. And I had something with every course.

At Table 10, I got a response that I'm used to from chains like Applebees. The waiter came back and said that they didn't really offer anything vegan, and only suggested a salad, though didn't offer specific recommendations on which had dressing without egg or dairy. Ultimately I ordered fries, spinach, and charred peas. It ended up being filling enough, but unsatisfying overall. The $9 serving of spinach was ordinary, though the charred peas were good.

Disclaimer: a vegan's view

I often don't bother reviewing restaurants with poor vegan choices, but feel compelled to here because this one couldn't even get me a salad that was sufficient.

I thought I'd get pizza with no cheese. Their pizza dough has egg in it.

Ok, salad. ALL of their dressings except for one also has egg whites in them. That's odd, but whatever. So I get the chopped vegetable salad with the one dressing they can offer. The salad was mediocre and meager in portion size. So after lunch here I had to go find something to eat.

Here with my friend to get his car fixed. The place is behind autozone, and it's pretty run down. The receptionist is rude and a smart (butt)..two qualities unneeded when already frustrated with a broken down car lol. Before we arrive we call to find out what parts will be needed..we go buy the parts. We get to the place and he tells up that we'll need additional parts. We ask for a print out/quote so that we can take it to autozone (to compare prices). He says "you can write it down. It'll all be about $50." Ok cool whatever. We go back to auto zone, receive a quote of $23, buy the parts and head back to the shop. Once at the shop the receptionist says oh yeah you'll need two bottles of that. -_- so back to auto zone. Hopefully this'll be the last trip.

One of the best Taco Bells I've been to. I came in around 1230 on a weekday, and it wasn't busy at all. I placed my order and went to wash my hands..by the time I came my food was ready. So you know how you'll take a bite of your food and the contents fall out of the opposite end? Well that's what happened with my beef chalupa (that's a good thing). The food was fresh and they weren't skimpy with the meat or anything lol. Customer service was good as well. No complaints!

So one thing that really stands out to me: one of the employees (John I believe) emailed me a copy of my inspection before coming out to talk to me. And the email included pictures! I've never seen this before. Maybe I'm behind, but before coming here I always went to Honda of Concord and Scott Clark Honda (wouldn't recommend either) and I've never seen this. I'm always cautious due to receiving false info regarding needed car repairs. This definitely gave me a peace of mind. This is my third or fourth time coming here and I'll definitely be back. The only downside for me is the business hours of 8-5 but aside from that I love this place.

I got here at 3:45..I'm about to head out at 6:15. Mani and pedi. They were really busy, which was fine with me today since I wasn't in a hurry. They're very organized and clean. I like that they use disposable sponges to scrub your feet. They've been open for about two or three weeks I think, so all furniture, equipment and polish is nice and new. I wasn't greeted when I first walked in, but the staff were nice and personable. They offer a variety of complimentary drinks (red and white wines, water, sodas). They're offering 10% off all services at the time, so my mani and pedi came out to $45. I'm pretty happy with the experience overall.

Love this place!! The food reminds me of Thanksgiving back home. So one thing that really stood out to me..I called to see if they had banana pudding. The lady answered and told me yeah. Cool..we head to the restaurant. About two minutes later I receive a call back and it's the lady from NaNas and she says, "I'm so sorry to be calling..just wanted to let you know that I went to double check and were actually out of banana pudding right now. I didn't want you to drive all this way just to find out we didn't have it". So this may seem pretty simple, but it was a big deal to me. She didn't have to call back - she was so nice and personable. We still ate there of course lol. I was too stuffed for desert anyway. But really friendly people, gave food suggestions and samples. Would recommend.

I use the pharmacy here and I've never had a poor experience. So I initially used Walgreens on N Tryon (avoid x10) and wasn't satisfied with the service, so I switched to CVS. The lady was super helpful on the phone. She called Walgreens to get everything sent to cvs. She was patient when I couldn't remember the name of the prescription and placed her on hold to look it up. I've been to the pick up window maybe twice and inside two to three times. They window service is prompt, but the speaker is damaged so you can barely hear anything they're saying. Overall, nice experience. Nice staff. Clean store. Doesn't seem to get too busy.

The red wines are my fave..very sweet. We used the groupon which was about $15 for both of us. The groupon included wine tasting (with storytelling), wine tour, souvenir wine glass and a full bottle of wine. Yes, there's a dog walking around and a red solo cup for dumping waste, but its a really nice vibe to me. They have rocking chairs, picnic tables, corn hole, a lake and lots of greenery. Oh and live music on Saturday nights. They have a friendly and diverse staff - always a plus. The atmosphere is very chill..would recommend to friends.

I love this place. I've been about four times and there hasn't been a night I didn't enjoy. The most recent show I went to was a comedian from Wild n Out. Hilarious. The set up is fine. Staff is friendly. I don't think they typically have food/drink specials (on weekends anyways), but the prices aren't too bad. If you're having trouble finding the building..go down the ramp you'd use to get to Label, or you can go in through Wet Willies and head to the back.

Broad ideas and poor execution -- Wild East tries to offer so many different cuisines that it's difficult for them to perfect any of them.

The menu is vast, from sushi and sashimi, to curries, pad thai, rice bowls, chinese-style fried rice and noodle plates, teriyaki plates, etc. Our party of four started with some appetizers that were underwhelming (overuse of large sauteed onions), and the main courses were generally unsatisfactory. The curry was described as "very mild" but was spicier than the sweet/hot thai dish which was described as "spicy". The teriyaki was served with rice, but there was not enough sauce to put the rice to use, whereas the thai dish was swimming in cloyingly sweet sauce that tasted like it came from a jug. The California King Crab roll was small for the price, though the flavor was apparently good.

There was a wait at the door for a few minutes while they prepared a table, but when we were shown to the cramped booth, there were several empty and clean booths on the way, why the wait?

Our waiter was also a bit awkward, bringing entrées out over a five minute span instead of at the same time.

Excellent baked goods, the cupcakes are excellent and moist, with delicious frosting.

The lunch menu is a reasonable size for lunch. Eating here you'll be full, but not stuffed. If you want quantity over quality, go to a buffet. The ingredients have been of the best quality, and well prepared.

The fresh salads are well balanced and served with a reasonable amount of dressing - not a vat as would be served elsewhere to tempt you to grossly over-dress your salad.

Coffee and Tea selections are excellent, and well prepared.

In short: avoid the steaks.

Was there with a group last night, and had a poor experience generally. The wine/beer list is varied, looks well curated, and is not overpriced (though not cheap). I had half-sweet tea which was a bit more tannic and less sweet than I would have expected, but still good. My wife had a good bottled cider. The pretzel sticks before the meal are a cute touch, and they work well.

We skipped appetizers, though we tried some of the lobster mac-n-cheese that a friend ordered and it was good.

For our entree we each ordered a steak, the spinalis (medium) for myself, and a filet (rare) for my wife. The spinalis is a tough cut to cook right, so the slight overdoneness can be forgiven, but it was also over seasoned and poorly trimmed. The steak sauce with which it was served is very one-dimensional, and did not pair well with the arugula/parmesan garnish at all. Would avoid the sauce if you want to taste the beef. My wife's filet (ordered rare) was medium-rare at the thicker end of the cut --yes, a filet with a thicker end-- and was medium/medium-well at the thinner end. This imparted a chalky mouthfeel to what should have been a silky cut of beef.

My steak was served with fries, though I asked for the truffle-parm fries. The fries were a sad portion, with a few full-length fries that were cooked right, and the rest of the portion looked like the leftovers from the bottom of the fry-basket --short and burnt. The truffle oil was applied too liberally and smelled almost scorched. My wife's steak was served with yukon gold mashed in a cast iron skillet, and they were moist and delicious. Would recommend the potatoes to other patrons.

I had opportunity to try the dessert paired with the prix-fixe vegetarian meal, which was a chocolate-and-berries cup with whipped cream. The cream was delicious and a great pairing in general, though the chocolate hunks should have been cut smaller - they were three-bite size.

I imagine that you can have a delicious meal at Zink, but when you're not precise with temperature, lack delicacy with seasoning, and are missing some small but noticeable details, it shows. If I were to return I would stick to easy-to-execute and more forgiving dishes like a burger.

My wife and I have been to this Hawthorne's a few times, and though they've always been good, our first visit was noteworthy for being perfectly executed.

Excellent service: the waitstaff has a good knowledge of the menu and is able to answer questions and make recommendations when you're not sure about your selection. Consistently quick with bringing food to the table, clearing dishes, and taking drink orders. Great waitstaff are great for NOT being noteworthy, they just make the meal progress and everything happens at the right time, with very little fuss.

The pies are excellent, try the special-white (ricotta, pesto, sundried tomatoes), and the plate of meatballs as an appetizer. The food has been consistently better than most other pizza places in the area.

The beer selection is good, with a couple options on the list for beer-snobs, and not unreasonably priced.

Last night my wife and I enjoyed a nine-course tasting menu, and I had the best crab cake, salad, salmon, steak, and cheesecake I've ever eaten - all in one meal.

Our meal started with a crab-cake and a small crab salad (with dill, apple, and celery). The crab cake was so warm and fell apart beautifully, perfect spicing, a little n'orleans remoulade underneath, and the lump crab was so sweet and tender. The salad was rich and creamy, a few bites of decadence.

We then had an artichoke bisque, which was unfortunately the low point of the meal for both of us as neither of us loves artichoke much. The base of the soup was fantastic, but the tough bits of artichoke were just okay, and the cracked pepper garnishing the dish was very coarse ground (which provided contrast to the consistency of the soup, but seemed out of place).

Then on to a baby wedge salad, mine with blue cheese and buttermilk, Barb's with a housemade vinaigrette. The salad was composed with perfect bacon, dried bing cherries, spiced pecans, the blue was fragrant without being overwhelming. Barb's vinaigrette had so much body and cling, with such great balance that she couldn't stop making pleasant-eating-noises - you know the ones.

We had a little sorbet (blackberry, such concentration of fruit flavor), and then the three main courses.

The salmon was served with wilted spinach and a potato hash, but the salmon itself was cooked to a perfect and consistent temperature throughout without overcooking the edges, or a slightly-underdone-center. It had a gently spiced rock-hard crust on one side, with perfectly cooked salmon immediately below. The plate was served with a smooth and tangy lemon beurre blanc. Best salmon I've ever had.

Next was the duck course, our server Johnathan mentioned reminded him of Christmas. Beautiful rare duck breast, served on a bed of whipped sweet potatoes (perfectly smooth, none of that stringyness you sometimes get with sweet potatoes) that had been flavored with vanilla and brown sugar. Not overly sweet but absolutely decadent, and a small serving of sauteed brussel sprouts. The richness of the duck offset the cabbagyness of the sprouts, and the sweetness of the potatoes was a great offset to that pair. On top was a single sage leaf - the most fragrant I've ever smelled - which tied it all together and made it feel like christmas.

The third entree was the filet mignon, what Barb would have chosen, had we only had one choice of entree. Served rare to mid-rare, it had the same amazing cookery as the salmon, where the temperature and doneness was consistent throughout to almost within a millimeter of the soft crust. Served with a green peppercorn sauce, by far my favorite sauce of the night, which had spiciness and richness. The mashed potatoes served with the filet were nothing much on their own, but served as a perfect vehicle for the sauce, and the braised collards were noteworthy for both their balanced flavor as well as the fact that they were perfectly cooked. The greens had little snap in the backbone, they weren't wilted as so many collards become. They were barb's first bite off the plate, and made her eyes light up and she was almost rushing me to try a bite. The steak itself was pure silk on a plate. Warm, lucious, flavorful (uncommon for a filet!). Unfortunately, I do think that Barb's half of the filet was slightly more cooked, and came out mid-rare/medium, but mine was perfect.

Next, a small goat-cheese log stuffed with dried fruit, rolled in crushed nuts, and served with two pieces of baguette. The baguette had a wonderful quality of being crisp and light (like melba toast, but not as dry), without having a crust that was so hard as to be painful to the gums (as so many toasted baguettes do). Also on the plate were a few tiny slices of celery, and a small drop of wildflower honey. This is not your store-bought-in-a-bear-squeezy honey, but rather it was fragrant and flavourful, very sweet, and brought out a dessertlike quality to the cheese/nut/fruit/bread combination. Barb, I'm sure, would go to great lengths to find that honey again, she enjoyed it so much.

Lastly, the cheesecake course. When it arrived, it was small, and we both looked at eachother and said "this is how cheesecake should be served", not a huge slab that's a chore to work through, but a small indulgence at the end of the meal. It was rich, but fluffy, and so moist. None of that powdery or clumpy feel that you get at a factory. Served with a bourbon-vanilla-cream sauce on the plate. The sauce was sweet, complex, but not cloying. The cheesecake was sweet and rich, and I mopped that plate clean. But the whole course was never too much of anything, it was just a perfectly walked tight-rope, never too sweet or too rich, never too moist or too dry, but everything was executed wonderfully.

This is some of the freshest, best tasting food - and you will crave it.   The staff - ask for Abner- is friendly and attentive. My favorite is the "soup on the side" but too frequently I have company and it's not a great sharing dish. The curry is great - and go spicy - it's a tollerable heat.  One more advantage - good wine list, all bottles just $20. Enjoy one of my favorite spots.

I have to start by saying that I love their goldieritas. And I love that they are across the street from me... Which is why I want to love their food. The first 10 or so times I went, the food was great. But the last 3-5 times, the food left much to be desired. The quesadilla had no cheese, only chicken. The chili is not even similar to a real chili. And the focaccias are not as tasty as they used to be... Where's the filling in the focaccia?! I used to love bringing friends there, but now I am too embarrassed about the food. My last friend date just pushed her food around and said that it was "interesting." This is a great spot, but stop dropping the ball, Goldie's!

I was referred to Dr Hobgood by my allergist. Within seconds of consulting with him, I knew he was the right doctor to perform my septoplasty. Dr Hobgood is not only incredibly personable, but he also does an amazing job! My surgery was quick, pleasant, and painless... All words that I couldn't imagine using to describe a surgery, but it's true. Although recovery lasted about 7-14 days, I wasn't in any pain throughout the process and I would describe it as extremely mild.  Dr Hobgood's pre and post op paperwork was clear and the surgery center was perfect. Even on days when I was early to Dr Hobgood's office, I never had a wait. Last but not least, I am so happy with my results! I would recommend Dr Hobgood to anyone!

This medspa uses sample products that are given to them by reps... I overheard a conversation between employees about this and became a bit wary. I still moved forward with the service and both my products wore off in one month.. these typically would wear off after 3 months for Botox and 12 months for juvederm. They say it's because everyone metabolizes differently... but experts would say this is due to dilution. Groupon prices are amazing but not so much so considering the potential dilution and the fact that they are using free products without telling us. That being said, Lori was fantastically personable, thus earning the one star for this place.

This was our first time in, as soon as we walked in the door we felt uncomfortable and the young girl that was behind the counter was not friendly, helpful, professional or service oriented at all !!!!!! The crust on the pizza was very good but, the sauce taste straight from the can. The bread with the salad was excellent but, if you want butter with your bread it's extra  $ ... lol !! Oh Yeah !! no balsamic vinegar or olive oil either.   We ordered two slices of cheese pizza , split a house salad , 1 peroni, 1 pilot grigio and don't forget the butter for our bread  $ 35.57. Lol !!! I suggest Famous Ray's Pizza 350 East Bell road Phoenix . True NY style pizza . There are many other Ray's in town but, this is the best one by far. Hands down awesome food, at Ray's .

There's only 3 other reviews for this shop and I am surprised. But I must say they gave them the right ratings. 5 stars all the way every time . I take my cars here religiously because I trust them working on my car, I trust their advice, and I am always treated with the most respect. From the manager Tony down to the techs, they have a light uplifting attitude. If I am having a bad day I come in to "check my tires" mostly just to see someone in a good mood. Also I like hearing them call it all out, it's a fun oil change.

I've always been leery about fish tacos and have yet to find a good one. Cabo's Fish Tacos are one word, "AMAZING"! I ordered there Honey Soy Glazed Salmon Tacos and they had the perfect seasoning and very tender. I also had the Carne Asada Tacos. If you are a beef eater you can't go wrong with these tacos. Again, seasoned perfectly and although the beef was cut in chunks they were still tender juicy pieces. And the spicy guacamole pasta as a side was probably one of the best pasta salads I've ever had. This restaurant gets a perfect score from me. I will definitely be returning here.

Although the service was great, the food was just okay. I loved sitting outside on the patio and enjoying the fresh air. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and I ordered it spicy instead of mild. It was a pretty decent size sandwich but definitely not spicy. The side order of fries were pretty good. My friend ordered the home made chips which were also  pretty good. Parking is easy, but during prime time (between 5p and 7p) it may be a little dicey to find a spot. I would go back simply for the atmosphere, oh and the drinks are pretty good. (This is a late post. I actually went last night for dinner and forgot to write a review until this morning)

Worst experience ever and it keeps on haunting us!  We moved our daughter in to the District on Apache in August 2015.  During her time of residency, she and her room-mate were chased by an aggressive trespasser resulting in them filing a police report - apparently the security gates and doors were not working properly.  Additionally, her vehicle was towed from the premises in error and subsequently damaged in the process - courtesy of the towing company hired by The District.  The District had been paid for our daughter to lawfully park there and did nothing to resolve the matter when the serious problem presented itself.  Our daughter was forced to be late to her place of employment as well as to make arrangements to retrieve her vehicle from the tow yard.  Finally, we knew that we were dealing with unscrupulous individuals at the District and therefore, made sure to request a physical walk through at the end of her lease this past July '16.  A maintenance representative walked the unit in our presence and provided a written receipt that the unit was in good condition "no damages".  This week, more than 75 days later, we receive a bill from the District for apparent damages that have since been found.  Do yourself a financial favor, and look elsewhere.

Very disappointing! I've been to many high end steak houses in the Mid West and Craftsteak would not rank in the top 10.

The good :
All the sides we tried were very good. But at $15-$22, the sides should be good. The risotto was the favorite. The mashed potatoes are also very good. The Caesar's salad was a classic with real anchovies. 

Service was decent but a little slow at times

The bad :
I had the grilled NY strip bone in ordered medium. After a lengthy wait. The steak came out way past medium. I sent it back. After another 15 minutes another steak came cooked properly. My wife finished her meal however before my second steak came. But the steak was the worst $50 steak I've ever had. For a dry age steak it was very tough. Even with the steak knife it was hard to cut. Most high end steakhouses will trim the gristle and fat from the outside of the steak but not here. I only ate half of my steak. 

They offered nothing for the inconvenience, no free desserts or discounts on the meal. Just a sorry. 

We made reservations at 7:45pm. There are plenty of tables available when we called. We got seated next to the bar, in the bar really. Terrible seats! Loud and constantly getting bumped by people at the bar. 

This is not what i expected from a Tom Colichio restaurant.

A friend and I walked around the neighbourhood looking for a place to eat and we stumbled upon because it looked lively and had great atmosphere.

Great patios, indoor seating, decor was great, good music. But that's ALL this place offered.
The drinks were mediocre, which came half way through our meal.
Corn on the Cob was not cooked all the way through
The guac was tasteless, not condiments just onion
The ceviche was overly "fishy" tasting
The tacos were cold, great tasting, but warm shells would have been great. 
The service was extremely poor and needs some serious improvement.
Over all, visually GREAT, but that is where it ends. Terrible food, drinks and terrible service. Extremely
disappointing, because I love Mexican.

RENTER BEWARE!! If I was able to give zero stars I would. AZ Management manages Lake West, Hampton House, Parkway Manor, Beacon Hill West, Kensington Club, Oxford Court, Colonial Club, Grace Apartments, and West Shore Manor- all in the Lakewood/Cleveland/Rocky River area. Beware of signing a lease at ANY of these locations. This management company will screw you over any chance they get. To say there is a lack of communication between management and tenant is a HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT. Communication is virtually non-existent.  If you try to reach out to these people, namely LINDA who is the office manager, GOOD LUCK!  These apartments are beautiful but you will save yourself a lot of time, MONEY, and aggravation by renting elsewhere.

I used Charlotte Mechanical for over several years until they started price grouching. My last experience was horrible. Once the technician came out and expected my pipe link. Instead of fixing the problem he told me if I didn't get additional replacement like an additional expansion tank and a new water shut off valve for my main water turn off switch. That he would not do any work in my home. The technician left my home without fixing the pipe link I had on my second level home. Which was accruing major water damage. Watch out for price grouching, I would not use them, they never give you a price quote over the phone and charge you $89 just to come out. They will not service calls on weekends and/or holidays unless you buy their service plan.

Leading up to the event, the team was very prompt in answering my questions, professional, timely, and truly a joy to work with! Our listeners enjoyed the custom take-home souvenir (photo) they received and all of the photos were available to view online within a few days following our event! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Party Booths to anyone looking to add an element of FUN to your event.

We come to Vegas 5-6 times a year and no matter what we are coming for we always start each night at The Bar at Times Square in New York New York Casino. The place isn't huge but it has the best atmosphere, best patrons, best drinks and best bartenders (ask for Mario, he is our favorite). The dueling pianos will have you singing along to all the songs you didn't even know you knew the words to. Everyone is having so much fun that you will meet tons of people that you can hang out with all weekend long. The only down part is that they close earlier than the clubs, but other than that, I only have rave reviews for my favorite bar in Vegas. We have stopped in so many times for one or two drinks and before we know it the whole night has passed by while we sang and made new friends. You have to love a bar like that! Plus, cover is only $10!

Best place to kick off your night in Vegas!

We came to LAX on 1/21/12 for a girl's weekend and got table service. This was the worst table service I have ever encountered. The waitress was never around so we could not order anything and the bouncers are bullies to the people getting table service. This was our first club of the night and we had not even started drinking at the table but one of the people in our group was escorted out because she was "swaying". We tried to explain that her feet hurt and she was shifting in shoes because we had been waiting for over 30 minutes for our table to be setup, but management was rude and refused to let her back in or give us a refund so the entire group could leave. 

We come to Vegas 5-6 times a year and regularly get table service at the main casino nightclubs. Do not waste your time going to LAX, but definitely do not get table service if you go there. You will get better service and be treated with more respect if you go to a kiosk bar in any other casino.

We came to Sugar Factory for the first time on 1/22/12, but this is now one of our new favorite spots in Vegas! The bartenders are so friendly and make the most amazing drinks; we especially loved the bartender KC. We had the Twinkie drink and it is our new obsession, you must try this! The food is delicious; we had salads, appetizers and dinners. You should defiantly go to the Sugar Factory on your next Vegas trip for dinner and drinks. We already made a reservation for a bachelorette party on our next visit.

I love iPic in that I don't like crowds and I hate the seat roulette, I also love being waited on :)

I am almost at a gold membership for this year, seriously Im there a few times a month, and there is only one reason this isn't a 5 star (it used to be).

The seats are becoming uncomfortable, I have even sat in a seat that was broken and the back would click in and out when I would recline (I only sit in premium). The back support is starting to lose the stuffing and I have been using my pillow and blanket to fill in. The seats are also becoming a bit stained.

I am hopeful that they will begin to re-stuff their seats and apply new coverings. Right now I have taken to ordering seats on the sides as they have less wear than the center seats I prefer.

No wait is too long for a classic breakfast spot. 

On a warm sunny October in Toronto, it was time to check out Emma's Country Kitchen on St. Clair W. The place was packed and the wait time was 20 minutes, but the staff was very accommodating and coffee ($2) was provided in take out cups for patrons outside waiting. Homemade donuts are available too which were a hit with many (arrive early for the bacon maple donut since they run out!).

Inside, the restaurant is light and bright and filled with a wonderful energy. The server was on his game and was very helpful with the specials and all our needs.

The group choice was The Classic ($10) which was a heaping plate of 2 eggs any style, bacon/sausage, delicious home fries, choice of toast and a side dish of happiness. The meal was hot, delicious and coffee refills were done promptly. I was so hungry that I ate it all before I remembered that I should have taken a pic. Oops.

Lots of other great meal options including eggs benedict, pumpkin (boo!) pancakes and quiche of the day.

Meal was ridonkulously inexpensive for Toronto. I would definitely return for more. 

Lots of street and bike parking. :-)

Beers for you, hard cider for me.

In between downtown events, the time was right to check out Barhop for a quick drink and snack.

Weather was cooperative in October, so the patio was the destination. The hostess was accommodating and the server was quick to provide the menu and options.

In the end it was a hard cider day. West Ave Heritage Dry hard cider and KW hard cider were the chosen ones and they were both great. Stuffed jalapeños was the appi which was hot (warning provided by the server) and sweet. Bacon makes everything better, right? These jalapeños popped!

Def on my hip radar for another pint.

We stopped in here on Canada day because OMI, down the street was closed.
We had wanted to try this place since it opened and were lured inside by their fish taco's on the display menu.
We sat outside to their lovely patio.

We indeed ordered the Fish Taco's, pulled pork taco's AND the calamari salad because we were hungry.

The food was okay - but unfortunately there wasn't a lot of it - so we also left hungry and ended up at the Loblaws sushi counter to satisfy our initial craving and persistent hunger.

The portions are really small for what you pay. I expect more than one grilled calamari tube and a small heap of 'greens' when a salad is 15$ 

The fish taco's had the equivalent of one thumb size portion of fish. The Pulled pork taco's we slightly more generous.

Again the food was palatable, but not so amazing as to justify the portions vs. value.

Have a beer on their patio, but if you are hungry, and you don't want to go broke satiating your hunger, this might not be the place for you based on what we ordered.

If 'soy-sauce' is authentic 'mexican' sure, enjoy....
The fish burrito was a total let down. After all the hype I was very excited to try this place... But it was over priced for what you got, and nothing special.
The burrito consisted of a mostly (90% no joke) mix of bland rice/beans with one strip of fish buried in the fold of the burrito.
Seriously, I had to OPEN it to make sure I hadn't received the wrong order. My dining partner had 3 pork taco's, which were better... But nothing special.
Rebozos makes better Mexican....and their fish didn't taste like it was seasoned with a packet of soy sauce, left over from another places take out.
Whannnn whannnn. I give it a 'meh' out of ten.

I always appreciate it when I get yelled at by a Drive Clean Technician. YELLED at!!!

There is a REASON they are available last minute to do e-tests!!! They aren't busy because the customer service here is in the negative.

I got YELLED at, because we disagreed that him charging me full price for an emissions test, after he refused to even do the test in full, was unethical.

Me: Hey my car needs an emissions test.
Grumpy man: *hooks up electronic code machine* it's not ready. It won't pass.
Me: Well I had the work done to it, and two mechanics said to get it done, so it should pass, can you test it?
Grumpy man: they need I go to school...It won't pass. Drive it more, bring it back. That will be 33.00
Me: But you didn't even test it.....
Grumpy man: it won't PASS and if *yelling now* IF YOU won't LISTEN to me you can call the DRIVE CLEAN People' *flicks a drive clean brochure at me*
Seriously.
Me: Well, they will be hearing from me. You charged me for a test you didn't even finish....this is ridiculous, and can we please not yell at each other!?
Grumpy man: 'I DONT NEED YOU as a CUSTOMER!!!' Still, obviously yelling.
Me: You don't have me as a customer.
I will pay you, because I am honest. You are not.
Grumpy man: 'I DONT NEED YOU as a CUSTOMER'!!

So yeah. If you want to pay for incomplete work, verbal abuse, and for somebody's grampa to make you feel horrible. A-1 is the place for you.

*** That was sarcastic. DO NOT go here. 
This is the reason they aren't a busy shop.

I LOVE this place. It's fun and friendly and the food is really good. Juicy, flavourful burgers that come with many different toppings. Great fries ( I prefer the Waffle fries which unfortunately are an extra 2$). The menu is extensive and I've yet to tray anything but the burgers 'cuz they just call to me  but that have mac and cheese choices as well as other diner faves.
The place does get a little loud but thats ok, it's a gathering place after all.

We still ended up paying extra because we ordered wine ect but the service was just disgusting.

This is my FAVE all you can eat sushi place. The sushi is great, always fresh and not skimpy slices of fish either. They have many varieties to choose from and lots of tasty  non-sushi items too such as udons, rice dishes, salmon etc etc. 
The service is friendly but, as with most all you can eat sushi places I've been to, they forget things we've ordered etc but that's ok, we just order more.
The price is good too and I've brought many friends there that now make it their go-to sushi place.
Love it!

If u are looking for a great pizza place with fresh ingredients, great hospitality, very positive atmosphere, then this is the place for you.  I had the meateaters pizza that's comes with pepperoni and meatballs but I substituted for bacon, sausage and pepperoni with roasted garlic, and it was delicious.  Depending on bomber of customers, the pizza prep may take a little time but cooks very fast, less than 3mins.  Also try the blood orange lemonade was really good, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.

we went sunday at around 1pm, party of seven. It wasn't to busy, they had only one server at the time they took our order, the food was good, but they really need help on service, no prebussing, no refills we had to raise our hand every time we need it something. they add 20% service charge to the check ( we knew that) maybe thats why they didn't care about our table, they knew they were getting a tip any way. we mentioned it to the server at the end, thats when she told us that the other server had left, cause it wasn't too busy. She  said i'm sorry and offer  to give us a free dessert or another beer.

Do not take your Birkenstock sandals for repairs to this place! First of all, they led  me to believe that they are replacing everything but the straps. When I came in to pick them up I noticed that the footbed was not replaced and I asked the person who brought my sandals about it to which he said it would have been extra 30$ and walked away. I was so disappointed that I didn't want to inspect the sandals any further and left the store. At home I started looking at them and  got even more frustrated because they did a terrible job. I payed 70$ for my sandals to look worse than before repair! I would have gotten a better repair in a third world country! And considering the previous reviewer's experience with them, it is pointless taking them back and trying to talk with the people working there. 
And this place has been doing Birkenstock repairs for 40 years?!?!? That was the only reason I agreed thinking that they know what they're doing.

Update: Is this a "quality repair" that falls apart one month later?

I first went to Carolinas Natural Health Center to take part in their Ultra Lite Weight Loss program. I connected with the entire staff from day one. Ultra Lite not only helped me reach my goal weight, but taught me how to keep it off. I was also impressed with their menu of  services including facials with Eminence products, Thai foot massages, pregnancy massages just to name a few. Most importantly, as a Naturopathic physician, Dr. Smith takes a natural approach to healing the body from within and treating the person, not just the symptom or disease. I am thoroughly impressed each and every time I visit Carolinas Natural Health Center.

I'm paying you money to be here and to be able to bring a guest. Find a better gym that's nots packed all day long. Equipment is never open, leaving this gym and going somewhere else that's cheaper and less packed. Look other places before coming here.

I figured the wait on a Sunday would be long and it was. 25-30 minutes turned into an hour for a table in the restaurant not a high top at the bar. Server was just ok. Never checked on us once to refill drinks until we were ready to leave. Probably because we didn't order beer. Wings were excellent. We ordered dry rub with 2 sides of sauce. Hubby's burger (Thick Rick) and fries were delicious - enough for 3 people! STAY AWAY from the Bay of Pigs Cuban pork sandwich. It was nothing like the sandwich described by the PD food editor. Unless you like 80% fat and gristle. It was gross... I'd definitely come back but stick with a burger or chicken sandwich.

Bellagio is disgusting. They have decided to cater to ghetto people and the homeless. I was told I had $300. In resort fees and parking fees in addition to the price of the room. I felt sucker punched. Asked why, she said all resorts are charging and bellagio isn't as much as other resorts. What? Why not just include it into the price of the room? I had planned on tossing around thousands of dollars on gambling, dining, entertainment and shopping. But since bellagio insists on catering to ghetto people who only have a couple hundred dollars to spend have damaged thousands of dollars in resort property. I refused to spend another dime here. The room overlooked the fountains but was small and beat up, obviously by the ghetto people bellagio caters to nowadays. Homeless are lounging around the hallways and the lobby, kind of smells bad.
Update: now bellagio wants to bill me for more hidden charges. Check it out, these new charges are from July 13th, we left on the 2nd, watch out for this place, they are dishonest. Total disaster!!!!

Service here SUCKS. I came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. Food came out ok, when the check came out, I advised my waiter my host at Venetian will take care of the bill and they had forwarded the comp to Casanova's computer. My waiter walked to the back, talked to someone and came out telling me that comps only work for lunch and dinner, not breakfast. Uhhhhh......wth? Since when were comps allowed only for certain times. I called my host, my host told me that its weird, it's supposed to work anytime. I told him i wanna speak to the manager, and he showed me to someone named Maria, i told her the situation and she said they never got the comp from my host, and even if they did, it only works for lunch and dinner. I called my host again, and told my host to speak with Maria, Maria told my host they never received the voucher, guess what happens....... she then said their system is down so they never got it. So i told them you know what, forget it, i'll pay for it. So i paid.

I was waiting around 30 minutes for them, then she tells me their damn system was down? Really? It took that long? Such pathetic service, my host had to tell guest services to walk the voucher up to them.

NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN

I have been looking for a used 750. I have searched and searched. My name must be at every dealer in Vegas. A few of them have reached out to be with a car they found but It had so many miles. I am searching but im not desperate, I still want and good running car, in good condition. One of the last dealers I stoped by was Desert BMW. Within one week Desert had reached back out to me and had a car on their lot. I went down the same day and they pulled off what looked like the impossible. Good job guys and keep up the great work.

So disappointed.  There were five hostesses standing around as we showed up ten minutes early for our lunch reservation,. We were seated about 12 minutes after our requested time.  Once seated we waited forever for a server.  The entire experience was just SLOW.  My meal was just average, the salad was overdressed and we had to ask for water and more drinks.

I was glad I did not suggest this restaurant since everyone in our group was let down

If the show extreme makeover hotel edition is looking for a project, the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas should be the pilot episode.  We stayed only one night last week because it was beyond gross.  Here is a short list of the problems that must be addressed:

Huge stain in carpet near our bed
Molded grout in the bathroom
Faint lipstick stain on drinking glasses in the bathroom
Cigarette burn in the sheets 

If our client had not paid for our room in advance, we would have checked out and stayed somewhere else for the single night.

I'm always looking for a high quality, value minded happy hour for an early dinner of appetizers.  If you're in Las Vegas for a show, or arrive from the east coast and are ready for dinner at 6:00 (it was 9:00 in NY and we had flown all day). this is a winner. 

The bar area is table service with a dozen different choices for snacks that add up to a meal.  Sushi, and cocktails at a bargain price.   The pineapple martini is a hefty pour with flavor.  

We (3 of us) ate and drank for an hour and a half in the bar during the aloha hour time period 5:00-6:30 pm.  We each had 2 cocktail drinks and more food than we should have,  we essentially had a full dinner from the aloha menu, with taxes and a 20% tip for superior service our bill was $78.

When I walk into any hotel I give it 5 stars, any negative experiences after that always impacts it for me. I think 2.5 would be a fair and accurate rating to give but 2 is my only option here. 
Yelp considers 2 to be "Meh. I've experience better" what a great way to sum this place up.

Our first two negative experiences happened at check in, the receptionist were nice, some of them were hard to understand but I don't think it was any fault of there's, more age related. Anyways we got our key card and proceeded upstairs to our non-smoking room. I swear, i've walked into some rooms that might have a "faint" smell of cigarettes, but this 1st room was as if someone took cartons of cigarettes, put them in the middle of the room and little them all on fire before throwing them out the window just as we walked in. We both were sick with colds so could not stand the stench. We walked downstairs again and politely told the front desk what happened. She apologized and said they were trying to fix this issue (it must happen a lot) but at least they are trying to fix it. Okay fine, second times a charm, we quickly are handed a new set of keys with a different room to test out.
Our second room smells fine, and we quickly get excited, but it was short lived as we try to turn on the lights and soon realize that not a single light switch works, including the bathroom. At this point i'm viewing the hotel as a hike to and from the front desk and consider activating my step counter.
Our 3rd visit to the desk we are polite again and explain what happened in this room, the women now seems amazed (maybe most people give up by the 3rd try?). So she quickly walks away and mumbles something about manager, she is being nice, i honestly cannot understand what she says though. I look at my female friend for a translation and she shrugs and mumbles manager in recognition of all i understood. 
Okay so the manager comes out and starts typing a novel on the keyboard and apologizing, he is also very nice and courteous, he helped us with 1 night resort fee which we definitely appreciated and moved us into our 3rd and hopefully final room.
Upon entering our 3rd room everything is in order, smells, electricity, running water... so i'm happy camper, my female friend collapses into the bed in exhaustion from our hike in zion park and now in Circus Circus. 
Day 1 complete at Circus Circus... why is the clown so scary looking?

Day 2
Goes fine, the building doesn't explode but watch out for the toilets, they flush so hard i swear they could suck your arm down with it. Okay not really, but they will surprise you if you're not ready for it.
So it's 10pm, (12/17) I tell my friend we should watch a movie, she shrugs without thought while staring at an ipad. I think she knows i'm tempting fate at this point.. 
I click the menu and it tells me to call the front desk for movies. Okay...that's a little outdated but sure. I pickup the phone and make the call, front desk doesn't answer, instead it is the operator, who tries to connect me again... no luck, so she tells me they will call me back in a minute. I wait 5 minutes and call back, she tells me they haven't forgotten about me and hangs up again. I wait 30 minutes and call back, reminding her it has now been over 30 minutes, she apologizes and says she will personally go check on why the hotel wont accept my money for a movie (not those exact words, but seriously..) I wait another 30 minutes and start writing this review. I have now been waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes including the writing of this review.. I'm not one to give up but honestly. I give up Circus Circus, if you don't have customer service or accountability, you do not have a hotel.

Sincerely,

Ryan
Prior customer service manager of 3 retail stores and now traveling

The pizza is pretty good. Especially at 2am. But when it takes over an hour for delivery, no thank you. I shouldn't have to call 3 times to find out where my pizza is. Then when he finally showed up he asked for a tip. That's the best way to not get a tip.

Let's start with if I could give this place negative stars I would. Honestly, this was the toughest and worst mani/pedi I've ever got. My friend was with me and asked for a full set, there was 3 employees sitting around on their iPads and after she already waited for about 30 minutes they asked her if she could wait 30 more. They were pressuring me to pick my colors and I couldn't really enjoy myself. They were all really rude and would stack customers on top of each other without finishing. I do not recommend this place AT ALL.

I enjoy shopping at Copps Food Center.  I have never said this about any shopping experience in my life.  I hate to shop...too many decisions, but I actually look for reasons to shop at this neighborhood store.  The place is super-clean, organized well, has wide, uncluttered aisles, and the selection is fantastic.  The check-out staff are always great and friendly.  I really enjoy their boxes of fresh-baked Mammoth Muffins!

There is no doubt that Otto's is a great, classic, establishment.  I have met a number of outstanding, classy, sophisticated, women in the lower level bar.  Bartenders are absolutely excellent.  The bar menu is outstanding & features quality items (not your routine "Bar Food").
Upstairs, where the true spirit of Otto's really shines.
By far, the finest dining experience on the West side of Madison.  Quite often I drive by and don't stop, simply because I'm "under-dressed" (Blue Jeans).  Honestly, take a date for drinks and Appetizers in the lower level.  If the date is going well...take her upstairs to demonstrate your level of sophistication.

I really enjoyed Joyce G's review.  It got me out of bed, off my can, and without Pre-ordering, went there to experience the place.  I can not recall a more honest, down-to-earth place to get freshly prepared, excellent chicken.  If you expect fast-food speeds, go get your hormone-infused chicken at a national chain.

The people here are excellent!  Not a chain!  If you don't have 15 minutes to wait for excellent chicken, please call in your order in advance.  I am willing to invest in this establishment...based upon the quality of the food & the atmosphere.

The customers that came in while I waited for my order were acknowledged, and welcomed.  The staff actually cared about their customers, and the quality of the meal.  I opted to skip the wings included with my order, and they actually reduced my total bill to reflect this change.

Nowhere, will you find better chicken and staff honesty than at Harold's!

Please realize that this is a small, owner-operated establishment that will give you exactly what you desire...if you can give them a bit of time to prepare your meal, only after you place your order.  Anybody that has been raised on chain-food, will be excused for their impatience...at their loss.

PLEASE...call in your order...and enjoy a great chicken meal...in the store or to take-out.

Honestly, I could live almost anywhere & I have chosen Countryside Corporate Apartments.  I moved in here with my son last January, my son is now away at the University of Iowa.  I like it here so much I have continued my stay.  The staff, management, Maintenance, and Housekeeping is excellent, and trustworthy.

Honestly, when they say that your unit is "furnished", they are not kidding.  They furnish everything you could ever need, except a toothbrush.  All dinnerware, silverware, appliances, laundry facilities on premises, large flat-screened TV's with programming and WiFi is included in the rent.  There is a well-maintained, fenced-in pool & plenty of BBQ pits around.  Great big parking lot guarantees plenty of room for your car.

Yoni and all the gang at Balancing Paws are awesome, I cannot say enough good things. I send my puppy Ruby there for socializing and training, she loves it and so do I.  Yoni is patient with both Ruby and I, he explains everything so that you have a better understanding of your dog and why they behave the way they do. I wholeheartedly recommend Balancing Paws for whatever issues you are having with your dog. And even if you don't have any issues, I recommend you take your dog for a doggy day camp. I swear Ruby knows in the morning if she is going to day camp or not and she is soooo excited when she goes. Thanks Yoni for taking such good care of my girl.

I was so excited to try this buffet, but alas, it left much to be desired. 
Perhaps it's because I'm from Boston, so I'm spoiled when it comes to fresh seafood, but I found it difficult to find any appetizing seafood here.
I started with the crab legs, which weren't bad, but were a bit stringy. I moved onto the cajan shrimp and calamari.. The shrimp wasn't edible, beyond fishy(YUCK!), the calamari was passable. Finally I made it to the lobster tails... ummm... I've had lobster countless times, I wouldn't call these lobster tails. They had a greyish tint, tasted like rubber, and left a very unsettling feeling in my stomach. 
Again, perhaps I'm spoiled by the fresh seafood of the east coast, or perhaps I was perturbed to have paid for a buffet of buffet pass, and paid an additional $15 for this seafood travesty, but I will not be back.

This buffet is smaller compared to it's Vegas counter parts, if we weren't staying here I'm not sure if we would have bothered. The food itself was good, made to order eggs, corned beef hash, real hash browns, bagels & bread for toasting,  and a carving station, but nothing that really stands out. 
If you are staying at Flamingo or the Quad and it is within stumbling distance, and you are just looking for breakfast, it's worth the try... otherwise there are many other suitable choices that will bring you more quality.

Found this place on Yelp, decided to give it a try. We were a bit wary at first because the place was pretty empty, but we decided to give it a try, and I'm glad we did. 
Our waiter promptly greeted us and went over the menu. 
We ordered a bottle of wine, which was kept chilled at our table, which was nice. My boyfriend and I ordered the porter house for 2, and a couple of sides. Our steak was cooked perfectly, and the truffle spinach was delicious!
Had we had more room, we would have tried dessert, but we were stuffed! Prices are high, but it is a steak house, so that being said, prices are not out of line for the service and quality.

The View is amazing, and adds a romantic ambiance to the overall dinning experience. Our servers were very attentive without hovering, we got a bottle of wine, which they kept chilled at the bar for us. We got the lump crab & artichoke dip, which was delicious, and a very ample portion, so much so I opted for a salad and soup for dinner (pathetic I know while at a steak house, but the boyfriend let me try some of his steak). The wedge salad was pretty standard, good dressing, but had 2 pieces of almost whole bacon, not crumbled. The French onion soup was fabulous, cheese was nice and crispy on top, and a good amount of onions. The boyfriend got the Ribeye, perfectly cooked to medium, and nice grill marks and a juicy center. We will be back.

I haven't been here for about four years, so when the opportunity to return came up, I jumped at the chance. Alas, it appears certain things have taken a dive. Our waitress started off great, bringing us water, taking our cocktail and wine order, then brought over the steak centerpiece and went over each steak. Cocktails and wine came out, our wine server was prompt in refilling our wine glasses and gracious. Our meals came out, and the steaks were cooked perfectly, but I wasn't wowed like I was the 1st time. Also, one of my friend's had an issue with his crab legs, there were 2 tendents attached, and the ends were rough. For $55, this is unacceptable, our waitress didn't come over for 15-20 mins, when she finally came over she took it off the bill, but she should have checked on us sooner to make sure our steaks were cooked properly. The steaks and sides were good, but you are paying a premium for the experience, and the experience was off and not worth the money.

My boyfriend and I stopped in here for dinner. First we went to the bar directly off of the casino, where we waited about 5 minutes and were not acknowledged once. We figured maybe we would have better luck getting a table. We stood in line at the hostess center, where there was one party of about 6 ahead of us. I'm not sure what was going on, there was a lot of back and forth between the party(who I don't think spoke great English) and the hostess, but we waited our turn for 5 minutes or so, while doing so the line behind us grew even longer of people waiting. At no point did the hostess even look up at any of use, and since the party of 6 was still in front of us, we waited. From the other door a couple walked up around the waiting party, and asked the hostess about seating, and she put them down!!! UMMM Excuse me??? You have a line of people waiting honey, why don't you try looking up! 
Needless to say we left, plenty of other choices in Vegas, although I think it's important to point out, we looked in the windows after leaving, and there were plenty of open tables. REALLY?

The omelet bar offers made to order omelets and eggs with a variety of filling choices, which we both opted for bacon and cheese and were cooked perfectly. There are a lot of different choices, which is great if your with a group or a picky eater, everything from pizza, Mexican to Asian cuisine and sushi. I only wish we more hungry when we came here.

Came here for breakfast on Saturday morning for the mimosa brunch, and happy we did :). They had a lot of breakfast options including a prime rib carving station, which was awesome. They had eggs to order, crispy bacon and juicy sausages. I was also excited they had gelato, the cookies & cream is a must try.
Our server was very nice and took very good care of us making sure our mimosas were always filled. I can't really comment on lunch, they only thing I tried was the fried chicken and mac & cheese that they had just put out for the start of lunch dishes, but I enjoyed both.

It unfortunate that this is so close and convenient to me. The food is fresh, which is the only reasom I go. The employees have such an attitude EVERY time I go. I have never been there and had a good experience with the workers. They are incredibly rude. Also during times that are busy, especially lunch, they only have one employee in the building. So the line will go to the door. I was in there when that has happened and 3 people came in and waited for a minute then walked right out. Something needs to be done on how rude they are.

We were excited to try this new cupcake store near our home.  We bought peanut butter and red velvet cupcakes.  My first thought was that they are way too expensive.  The cupcakes are $3.50 each and quite small (smaller than Sprinkles where they are $3.25 or $3 if you buy a dozen) and plain looking - no decoration.  Given the price, the presentation/packaging added insult to injury - they didn't even put them in a cute box or anything.  They put them in a little paper bag in which they could easily get smushed on the way home.  At first, the amount of frosting looked chintzy, but it turned out to be enough.  I was excited about the "filling" in the middle of these, but there was barely any in them.  The filling in the red velvet was a little strange - pretty straight cream cheese.  Both cakes were too dry around the edges.  Overall, they were tasty (especially the peanut butter) but the price for what you get will keep us from going back.

I've been here probably five times for pedicures.  I was mostly happy with my nails, but I find the front desk staff unfriendly and think that's inexcusable.  No smiles or warm greetings.

Was so hungry for breakfast but everything was so pricey, ended up getting an apple danish which costs $4 and it wasn't even good! Too much flour and was chewy. A colleague mentioned that he had a burger which costs $20 of which he took a bite and left everything behind coz it was overly dry. Another colleague had a $25 salad which was similarly disappointing as well. 
I'm sorry, my apple danish was enough to leave me with little or no desire to return to try anything else and since many others described their disappointment of lunch and dinner items!

YES! I finally dined at Nobu, considering it was Iron Chef, Masaharu Morimoto's restaurants when he won the challenge. Ok, this is not the original restaurant where he worked (that is in NYC) but this is a branch of it. According to Wikipedia, he left Nobu in 1999, eventually opening his own Morimoto restaurant in Philadelphia in 2001. So I will eventually eat at Morimoto.
Nobu was a good experience, although as other yelpers pointed out, why was this in Hard Rock Cafe (seemed kinda out of place) and the kitchy Hawaiian decor, the decor lost one star in my books.

The miso cod was heavenly and so was the tuna tartare with caviar. The roll we had was good as well. Pricey but definitely quality sushi.

I reunited with two high school friends in Phoenix, Arizona last Spring! Thank goodness not in the extreme summer heat! The other girlfriend flew in from Maryland and we both met up with our friend who gave birth to a baby girl who now lives in Phoenix. Phoenix girl suggested dim sum and to go to this decent chinese restaurant across town. I was hesitant since coming from bay area, we have really good dim sum in the area but nevertheless Maryland girl was craving some chinese food hence dim sum was it. We arrived at 11am and secured a table for 3. As we started indulging in our food, we noticed the stream of people coming in....suprisingly the food was fresh, tasty and decently priced. It was a memorable reunion nonetheless. :)

Love the O show and theatre at this hotel. Beautiful restaurants, romantic garden during all seasons (they change the arrangement and setting every season, Spring, summer, fall, winter - how trendy!) and fountain area, everything is just perfect. Exquisite and extravangant, after all it's Vegas, everything has to be over the top. This hotel has style and it's not cheesy. So much attention to details, from furniture to tapestry and definitely check out the details in the ceilings as well. Who is not to like this hotel??? It's creme de la creme of the entire crop in Sin City!

I've been here for several conferences in the past and just returned recently. The conference/convention area is very spacious (everything is extra large and spacious in VEGAS!) so you tend to walk a lot. The rooms are spacious, the audio system seems decent but the AC is turned up way too high! Well, then again, I guess they don't want everyone to be stuffy or falling asleep at sessions. :)

The lunch offering were ok although several ppl did not favor it too much, I liked the dessert on the 2nd last day (key lime chocolate chip cheesecake and pineapple cake, so moist and delicious!) I thought the snacks and fruits during the breaks were pretty good. 

Watched Goo Goo Dolls perform as part of the convention and the ballroom was a decent size with pretty good acoustic.

Been eyeing this one bag and surprise surprise, they have two left! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Great selection but I was just informed that the US collection is made in US and not France. Sigh....so their prices is definitely a lil lower compared to Gucci, Dior, Chanel, etc.

Great location right smack in the middle of the strip. Came in here after watching Mystere and hunted down some water since we were parched from the dry weather! Colleague found some stomach medicine to heal his unsettling tummy apparently from some bad food the day before...
Friendly staff and quick turnover at the lines.

This was far from the strip and certainly not very walk-able, depending on where you are coming from. We were coming from Mandalay Bay so this was definitely not walk-able! We were dining at Nobu but upon entering HRC hotel, it's very typical to be filled with rock and biker memorabilia or collective items! It's just not my style, we wanted to eat at Nobu so we had to end up here. I have to admit that I've never been to the hotel and even so when it's far off the strip. Not sure if I'll ever return....sorry, just not my thing....

I must say that the selection of shops here are better than the Fashion Show Mall or the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. Have to like the Gucci, LV, D&G, Theory stores here which usually carries a better selection in these specialty stores. If you get tired from shopping, just stop and watch the statues "talk" at the Atlantis fountain show. 

I just witnessed first hand, the new 175,000-square-foot, three-level addition includes more upscale shops and several new restaurants, as well as a spiral escalator!

From the slot machines upon arrival at the airport to the larger than life variety buffets, everything is just over the top. I guess everyone has to visit at least once in their lifetime and you'll be amazed or totally disgusted? :)

The hotel setup that mimics everything, you can have a little piece of Italy, France, New York, Egypt, pirates, classy to ghetto fabulous, you name it, you can and will have it. Btw, Elvis, Marilyn, everyone is in Vegas! 

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas + Ka-ching $$$$ !

Made reservations on Opentable but like others have pointed out, it wasn't necessary but still, it was better to be safe than sorry esp on a Thursday night in Las Vegas. 
We were seated by the windows which had a gorgeous view of the strip overlooking the neon lights of Harrah's, Imperial Palace Hotel and Paris in the close distant. 
We started with edamame, closely followed by a tuna tataki salad which had a hinge of too much vinegar but the tuna was good. Then we tried the toro with scallion roll - excellent, melted in the mouth, Roku and roll roll which had combination of 3 fishes, unagi sushi and toro sushi. Then we finished with the Chocolate Volcano which was a warm chocolate cake oozing with chocolate sauce in the center with vanilla bean ice-cream, it was delicious! 3.5 stars. I thought the sushi at Nobu was a tad better. But service was impeccable considering other prime restaurants with very poor and s-l-o-w services in the last few nights!

Well, it is a regular mall with regular stores, however it was my first time in a Clinique store, since when did they have their own store?! Only in Vegas, I suppose. 
It has a nice facade, big silver and round button-like decor, very shiny, very Vegas-Hollywood, after all, it is next to Planet Hollywood Hotel.
Overall 3.5 stars since I found what I was looking for, to heal my chapped lips. 

FYI Saw the billboard that H&M opened their doors in this mall last Thurs, Oct 4.

We had a great team event (getting to know other team members) here but not much can be said abt the food. I had the ahi tuna with cold soba noodles, the soba wasn't bad but the tuna had some funky taste to it. The sauce did not go well and it was just undesirable. I left half of it behind. First time that I did not fish ahi tuna! We had a big group for dinner, abt 20 but the entire restaurant was empty but it took ages before we received the food. They were certainly not understaffed since there were at least 20 servers running around but no idea why. 

I'm sorry but two star is being generous; 1 for the great group camaderie and networking event we had and 2 for the somewhat nice interior decor.

After reading all the rave reviews of this spa, I couldn't resist but booked myself for a massage there after a long week of convention activities. The facility was impeccable and it was great since it was earlier part of the morning. 
The classic massage ($140) by Aaron was heavenly, he had strong hands but definitely helped eased the knots away from the tight shoulders and also exhausted feet. 

The roman baths were great since I was the only person there. The steam room, the arctic snow room was different with tiny snow flakes failing from the ceiling...in a spa, that's a first time! :)

The entire facility was top notch, clean and sanitized and definitely comparable to Burke Williams. I would definitely return for a masage again or facial if I return to sin city. 

Happy ending, yes! Not that way, silly!

Wow, one must seriously wonder why Britney Spears or Nicky Hilton or the likes of them would want to hang out here? Perhaps celebs get better treatment or perhaps this is a new spot? 
The space was not much of an expansion from the previous Ra Club although they changed the entrance walkway and we were certainly not wow'ed by the interior or the music. For a Thurs evening with a rather full crowd, the DJ was playing old Usher, Michael Jackson and Madonna's Like a Virgin. We were glad not to have to pay the cover charge since we had free passes, thank gawd! Certainly not impressed, perhaps it's better on Fridays or Saturdays but I would certainly check out Mix or Pure or Tryst which are supposedly some hotter clubs...

I was about to purchase the lip balm treatment but found out at the cashier that there were other lip product offerings too so the very helpful and friendly staff patiently worked with me to help me find the best fit. Vegas sure is dry and everyone suffered from chapped lips and dry skin during the convention. A colleague commented that we might all be turning into flies (not sure why), chapped lips, sorethroat, headaches....sigh....

In any case, I found my lip product here when it was out of stock at nearby Sephora. Wow, an entire store of Clinique products. I don't really use their products except for the Super lip balm and they have it here. :)

Friends and colleagues rave about the suite-type rooms here. Yes, it's bigger than regular/standard rooms and ok, the bathrooms are spacious but I thought the fake gold over the fixtures and furnishings were a lil tacky. It's definitely a nice option and no doubt, the entire Venetian theme setting is grandeur at its best, again, it's Vegas and everything is possible, even a gondola ride!

The only comforting factor perhaps is that they have TCBY. For some reason, TCBY is not in SF or am I missing out? Love the chocolate yoghurt(?) with mixed nuts, YUM! Line, what line? Wait, what wait?

I came in here looking for Clinique Super Lip Balm treatment cream however, they were sold out. She was kind enough to let me know that just around the corner is the Clinique store itself and I can probably find what I'm looking for out there. Thank goodness so I don't have to hike over to the Fashion Show Mall. Every step you save walking in Vegas is a big deal!

I visited two yrs ago and personally thought it was ok, not the best aquarium but definitely not the worst. It's fun and if you have some time to burn and since you are already in Mandalay, it's worth a shot. $16 is steep but then again, everything is pricey in Vegas.

After reading about the lounge on the Vegas 24/7 lil booklet, I had to go catch a glimpse of what it's all about. 
After the conference ended for the day, I managed to squeeze in some time to check it out before dinner time at another locale. It was empty at 6pm although some folks were enjoying their drinks! By golly, the view is fantastic! It is definitely at par with that of Aqua in Hong Kong, wide open view beyond miles of the strip and the surrounding desert! 
I have to return on a regular night to experience the action but the view and the setup and the semi open-air lounge area is killer! 

The women's bathrooms each opened up to the view below! I hope it's one way mirrors but you can go about your business and enjoy the view outside! Will post photos soon! 

The dining area is white and has a great setup! Perhaps to return and try dining there at some point....Mix in THEHotel is one fineeee place, ambience-wise!

My personal favorite is still "O" and followed by Zumanity that deserved 5 stars. Mystere wasn't bad and I'm glad I picked this over Ka since Ka did not have very good reviews or it being mediocre. 
Mystere was very engaging but certain acts seemed to have been done at other shows. However, the costumes were colorful and definitely fabulous but they did put in a lot of fillers (adult baby and this clown-like character) a few times throughout the show, I guess to fill in the slot while the other characters change into something else or when the production crew prepares the stage. 

Overall, a good time, cheaper tickets compared to Ka and suitable for children as well.

My memorable hotel experience entails a certain penthouse suite in this hotel several yrs ago. We were treated to some serious VIP treatment since things were being comped. We had a 3 bedroom suite, living room, limo service, show tickets, the whole nine yards. It was definitely a fun time and not forgetting the James Bond themed party on New Year's eve. 

The lion's den is worth a visit as well!

Colleague's friend raved about this place so we made reservations for a party of 5 to try this place out. It was packed on the "outdoor" seating area so we sat inside. Service was tremendously slow, is this Vegas type of deal? All these supposedly fancy and upmarket restaurants have mediocre food and super slow service for some odd reason! I had the seafood boulabaisse which was ordinary, certainly not wow, was kinda similar to other ordinary Italian places that I've been too. It wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't off the wall good!
Colleagues said their ahi tuna dishes were moderate but supposedly the steak was not to be missed.

I had to leave early for the Cirque show at Treasure Island so apparently, I missed out on a good chocolate dessert. I've tried other Wolfgang's restaurants but this did not stand out.

OMG, what a horrifying experience! Well, the work convention was at Mandalay and due to last minute registration, I couldn't get into Luxor or Mandalay so instead of hiking from other hotels, I decided to stay on the same side of the block and figured there was the tram to ease the walk a lil. Tower 1 is beyond old, it's ancient dinosaur, a glimpse into a cheap and bad Motel 6!! My gawd, how can they not do anything with it soon?!! Fortunately, with a $20 upgrade, Tower 2 was much newer and nicer with flat screen TV and new carpet and solid mattress and new bedding and sheets!

I gotta say that I have never been so satisfied with an auto repair service center. I'll say upfront that I know little to nothing about cars or their upkeep. I took my 19 year old Caravan in because there was a major leak from under the hood. Not only was Damien courteous but he didn't make me feel like an idiot for not knowing more about my vehicle. I have literally been scoffed at, looked down upon and taken advantage of by other service centers but not here. Pep Boys was honest in their assessment and totally understood why I would not have the costly repair done. I have FINALLY found my auto repair guys (for at least as long as Damien stays there) and would highly recommend this shop to anyone who, like me, knows nothing about cars and is tired of feeling that they are being taken advantage of and looked down on. AND to top it off they're charge for a quote was beyond reasonable. They could have dinged me to death with fixing one thing and then saying that they found another, and another, and another like I have experienced over the years from other auto repair places. What a relief to know that the next time I have a car that needs something done, I do not have to go through that nervousness and fear, I just have to got to Pep Boys on E. Sahara!

I had an appointment from a referral and after having to call their office to find them (when they called to make my appointment they failed to mention the address is 7785 W. Sahara but the building sits behind a mini complex and sits far back from the street it is actually on, which is Buffalo) and even though I had had to travel by bus appx an hour and a half from East Desert Inn and Sandhill, I made it on time. I filled out the required pages of medical history etc and the final page was a document that was a "Consent for Treatment" form. It listed various types of treatment that could be required and many statements of the possible problems (loss of the use of hand, etc) that could arise. At each of these I had to initial that I had been informed (He is definitely attempting to cover his butt!) At the bottom of the form I was to sign over my consent. I did not sign and asked the receptionist if I could hold off signing until I had at least MET the Dr. She informed me that the Dr. would not even speak to me until the form was signed. So I informed her that I would not be staying for the appt (even though it meant another hour and a half home by bus and starting all over again with a different Dr.) I can't believe people actually sign something like that having never met the Dr. It is like having a 'friend' set up a blind date and the date calls and says I'll pick you up Friday at 7:00. Then you ask "Where are we going, what are we going to do?" And he answers: "It's a surprise." Would YOU get in his car?????

Try the fattoush salad with chicken shawarma. Don't forget the garlic! 
and for some of you who likes spicy food, try the sujuk,it's my favorite. we will be back.

I am a regular customer there,and I always get the same thing.which is the luau chicken salad.I realized that they had added pineapple to it,and it didn't have a flavor to it.plus I use to love the dressing ,but i realize that the dressing was too vinegry....and I realized that they put the complimentary bread in the microwave........

I honestly didn't want to make a scene,but I realize that ,something changed in that place,even though the food came out very quick,but I just felt ,who ever made that salad,did a sloppy job.by the way,it have been more then a week since i ate there.I honestly love the cheese cake factory,I will always come back,cause,they have stuff on their menu,that you can't find any where,but i just wish,the luau salad, didn't have the pineapple.plus it wasn't too appetiting.

As noted by all of the other reviews,  there WILL BE a wait as this place has only 18 seats and a limited number of cooking kettles, but your tastebuds will be so delighted that the wait will be well worth it! Upon approaching the Oyster Bar inside the Palace Station Casino you could smell the cajun spices and heat in the air.. just follow your nose! Fortunately there were only 3 people in front of us at 4pm on a Wed, so we only waited approx 15-20 mind for seats. Upon sitting down you can see the authentic kettles and masses of incredible seafood being prepared deftly by one chef. Lobster, crab, mussels, clam, brandy, garlic - ever delicious Cajun ingredient being expertly boiled, simmered, seasoned and prepared to perfection. I have only had seafood as flavorful as this on my one trip to New Orleans. Though we didn't have the oysters, they were being shucked right in front of us and they looked SO incredible! Huge and plump and looking so fresh, we will definitely be ordering a dozen to share next time! 
I had the combo pan roast level 6 of spiciness and JJ, the chef that prepared our food, cooked and spiced it to perfection.  It definitely had a kick and every piece of seafood was cooked perfectly - lobster, shrimp and crab. My girlfriend had the shrimp and lobster fra diavolo and it was spicy, brothy, and delicious. The pasta seemed very fresh and drank in the smoky, spicy broth amazingly.  The portions were huge and we left with enough food to eat for at least a meal or two later.  If you aren't grumpy hungry and are willing to wait a little while for genuine flavors and quality this is the place to go!

Found this hidden gem via other yelp reviews and it lived up to the expectations and more! The bolis are as delicious as promised and the lunch cheese steak special was a fantastic deal (Included a soad/tea and fries for about 7 bucks) . The dough on the bolis is just heaven. You can taste the homemade authenticity and care that goes into the preparation of each boli. Four Kegs is a bit of a dive, with only about ten tables but with food like this you will definitely want to venture away from the buffets and pricey fare of the Strip.

Equally as amazing as the food was the cheery and friendly service we received from Kelly. She was sweet, knowledgeable,  helpful and fun! She made the experience even better by cracking jokes and just being relatable and friendly.  We left feeling like friends and definitely will be back next time we're visiting Vegas. I couldn't recommend this joint any more highly if you're looking for great food, reasonable prices, amazing service and a Cheers-like feeling in the heart of Sin City.  Kelly rocks!! Go visit her and enjoy some amazing food while you're at it! 

Side note: a lot of people have been confused by the directions/location. We saw a sign for Four Kegs near a vacant McDonald's building and were a bit confused at first but with just a quick spin around the parking lot we found it with no problems.

Dooby's Grill is a great find! The food is prepared with fresh and healthful ingredients, the presentation is attractive, and the service is the best. We dined here a couple of weeks ago with another couple, and then again last night; it was stellar both times. The owner is usually on-site and it is clear that he takes pride in his restaurant and providing a nice dining experience for his customers. This is the type of small, owner-run, quality restaurant that we should go out of our way to patronize, especially during these tough economic times.

I went back a couple weeks later to return one of the phones I upgraded, lease was up and had no need to purchase the phone outright.  I talked to Josh again and he directed me to Jackie, a sales rep who could help.
All I said to Jackie was "I want to turn this phone in, the lease is up and have no reason to own it outright, can I turn in to you or do I need to ship it back to Sprint?"  Jackie, chewing and popping her gum like a 12 year old replied, "You needed to make that decision when you upgraded your phone."  Followed by a big sigh and a slight eye roll.  Thankfully Josh was standing next to her while she was still sitting on her ass.  Josh jumped in and said I needed to return it to the store on W. Sahara and gave me the address.  Good thing my girlfriend was with me or would I have snapped on piercing in her face, crap attitude, unprofessional little miss thing Jackie. 
Too bad one awful employee/experience can far outweigh the good ones.  I don't mind the store, Josh and Alex were great but if you get stuck with Jackie ask, beg, plead for anyone else to help you.  I think the door was more polite than Jackie.

The last few years my health has put me on the brink of seeing the great white light. Now that I'm healthy I have been pondering a tattoo to remind me of how lucky I am to be breathing, and wake up to see the sun everyday.

After 6 months of searching for the right design and tattoo shop I went to Skin Design. I was a walk in customer and the staff were welcoming, fantastic and put me at ease. I had a consultation with David Ruiz, the shops master "Script Artist". I gave him my idea and we made an appointment a couple days later.  David nailed it!!!!!!!!! I couldn't be happier.
My guess is this is Robert Pho's shop and his status in the tattoo world is top notch, and I'm sure he isn't going put people on his staff who don't meet his standards. Great staff, clean, sterile studio, the lobby is plastered with awards, trophies, and endless news and magazine write ups. 
If you want a custom tattoo, don't look anywhere else.

My 6mo Experience as a Client. 
Chad the owner came to my winter home in N Scottsdale. Assured me that hiring AQUAMAN POOLS to maintain my pool with a visit every 2 weeks. To expect a clean, swim-able pool whenever we arrived...
Things seemed fine for a few months although the "Up Charges" for Chemicals EACH VISIT seemed unusually excessive? Then my Landscaper started calling me saying the Pool looked terrible. Dirt on the bottom, Alge on the edges??
Seemed strange since AUQAMAN POOLS just hammered my AMEX $179.00 two days prior?
Had my next door neighbor check on the Pool and he confirmed it was unusable and hadn't looked like my Pool had been maintained in many weeks?
I immediately called Chad the owner of AUQAMAN POOLS this Saturday morning. All I received (Twice) was his company's offsite answering service. No-one from AUQAMAN POOLS ever returned my phone calls this day?
Sent an email to Chad Firing him and his Company. Still no reply...
In my experience with 13ys home ownership in Scottsdale AZ and Pool Companies for part time residence or seasonal visitors. It's a constant SCAM where they continue to ask for your trust, bill your Credit Card every 2 weeks and NEVER live up to what is promised knowing that your not on site to make sure the work was done as invoiced.
AQUAMAN POOLS and Chad the owner... Just another company with a nice Brochure. Over commit and under deliver.
A Pool Company to AVOID!!!

This salon had good reviews so I decided to take a chance and I'm glad that I did! I have had gel nails before but had a bad experience so I wanted to try again. They has the biggest get colors available that I have ever seen. I was very impressed. I got a gel French manicure and Tina was great! They turned out so well I couldn't be happier with the result. Every time I come back to Vegas for break I will make sure to come back to the salon!

If you have an Issue with your landlord Call them first, I had a dispute with the Property management after moving out and cleaning as much as i can on the property this company decided that not only that they will not give me my security deposit back but instead charge me for paint, to sum it up i have to pay an additional $1000. I called around most lawyers turn me down and some charge a lot just for a consultation unlike Cronus law they immediately accommodated me and schedule a Free consultation. 
The staff and lawyers were polite and professional, I hired them on and the end result was i did not have to pay the property management company and even got a portion of my security deposit back.

We are ready to look for a vet that treats the animals with more compassion and respect for the owners. We have 2 x 5 months old puppies that  are now sick with diarrhea as a result of the vaccination. After several visits paying for lab fees and recommended food and follow up visits, the puppies are not getting better. Every time they recommend another treatment, the dogs get sick. Their approach is not with diagnosis but rather the shotgun approach even though we paid handsomely for the diagnosis.
A quick update, since we stopped coming here, our dogs are now healthy as we're provided with solid information from our new Vet. I am very upset at this clinic because I feel they took advantage of our ignorance being new to dog ownership. It seems all they saw was dollar signs. Sad really.....stay away if you love your pet.

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. 

Everyone beware, we ordered take out for a party and when we opened the package at home only 2/3rds of the amount of wings we ordered were there. This place is an absolute joke. The wings they give you are tiny and they cheat you on order size. Even after calling the store to complain the owner got on the phone and rudely told us we were wrong and he was right.  We paid over $120 dollars and got 50 wings when we should of received 80. Save your hard earned money and get your wings from duffs or all star. Do not be scammed by this wild wings and the dishonest owner/management.

Love this place. Such a cute location - an old house w wooden floors and a fireplace. Lots of urban art. It gets really busy around noon, but if you take a later lunch, it's perfect. They play awesome music. I think it's geared to a younger crowd but good for anyone really. Definitely has the hipster touch, but it's not overwhelming. Food is suuuper yummy. I usually stick with the hot sandwiches. The BLT is TO. DIE. FOR. The North Beach is also very good. If you're looking for very attentive service, you're looking at the wrong place, but if you're looking for a nice place to chat w friends and not be bothered by someone refilling your water glass every thirty seconds, then this is a great choice.

Food and atmosphere here is amazing. I've been twice and everything I've ordered and friends have ordered has been across the board delicious. Service could be improved but not a major issue. Called about happy hour today. They only offer 1 drink for $5 from 4:30-5:30 PM during the week. That's their happy hour. This place probably would have gotten 5 stars from me if they offered a normal happy hour and I probably would be coming in more often. Too bad.

I've been here on several occasions. The food is always so yummy. I like to get The Over Easy. So flavorful. The french toast is amazing (both versions), and to top it all off, they have FRESH SQUEEZED OJ!! Omg. I love fresh juice (This also makes for excellent mimosas). The ambiance is nice and casual. They play great music and if you can avoid their busy hour, the wait is never long. I've felt unsure about the service in the past, but had a great experience the last time. Wish I could remember the servers name, but he was very attentive. Overall, definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch

Had the best experience here for my birthday. Service was incredible (our server was Kyle - very knowledgeable about the food. We never lacked anything). The food is ridiculous. I shared the chorizo porchetta. TO DIE FOR. Everyone loved their tacos which were recommended by our server. We had a small incident involving one of our drinks, but both our server and the manager/gm/owner (?) went above and beyond to make up for it. Not only did the manager apologize, but he also brought out a round of delicious tequila for myself and 9 guests which everyone loved. If that was not enough, our server brought us (I'm pretty sure) every dessert they have on the menu. Both the tequila and 6 desserts were comped. I'm so incredibly impressed by our service here. They made my birthday dinner so special. I will definitely be back and recommend this place.

Was told great things about this place but was left disappointed. We started out with oysters on the half shell, and a cheese and meat platter. Can't really go wrong with those (as long as everything is fresh, which it was). For dinner, we asked our server what she recommended. The sea bass was so highly recommended by our server (Amber) that 3 out of 7 guests ordered it. When we started eating it, the 3 of us were shocked by how flavorless the fish was and the side "salad" it came with was a mystery to all of us. We weren't sure if we were eating corn or noodles or weird oats. We all returned our nearly $40 dishes and ordered new things. The waitress messed up the order and split the scallop ravioli between the three of us. The scallops were chewy and the thick cream of the sauce left me feeling nauseous. The server had a really hard time remember our requests throughout the entire dinner. The only reason I gave this restaurant 3 stars is because they took off the sea bass charges, comped our split ravioli and had good apps. Don't think I'll be returning any time soon. :(

This is one of my best friend's favorite places to go to happy hour. Went there for the first time this week for reverse happy hour. Our server, Daniel, was very attentive and cheerful. The food we had was very good (brie sandwich and chicken fettuccini) and the ambiance was really nice. I liked it so much that I went back the next day with my boyfriend. I had the most delicious lavender fizz cocktail. My boyfriend was a big fan of his burger. Our service was definitely not as great though. I liked this place and I will probably go back, but I wasn't a big fan of the inconsistent service and the prices were a bit steep even during happy hour.

One of my favorite mariscos (seafood) places in the valley. Their avocado salsa is amazing. They make incredible micheladas (which is surprisingly difficult for a lot of Mexican restaurants). Their cocktails are delicious. The restaurant is very clean. My only complaint is that parking can be difficult to find, but still, if you're craving refreshing sea food, I would highly recommend this place.

HOLY MOLY!! James is literally the best. Booked his service last minute for a 30 minute ride for a wedding. Not only was he the only company that was willing to accommodate such a short ride on a very busy day but he was on time and answered every call/text/question. I would absolutely recommend Arizona Bus Company. Their party bus was clean, new, and fit almost 20 people very comfortably. Thank you, James. I'll be sure to use your service whenever I need a party bus in the future. Oh! And the price was INCREDIBLY reasonable. The whole bridal party was thrilled that we could drink and dance for about $5 a person!!

What a horrendous place.  Went in for a spider bite. They made me wait 30 minutes when NO ONE ELSE WAS THERE. I was actually the only person in the office beside staff (2 people). Went in because I'm paranoid about bug bites. The "doctor" told me there was no sign of infection but as a "precautionary" measure gave me THREE prescriptions for "preventative" purposes - including antibiotics. Needless to say I won't be back.

Such a cute place. Really hope it doesn't go out of business. Definitely a "hidden" gem. Great service. Met the GM - he was super friendly and welcoming. Our server was upbeat, pleasant and answered all of our questions. They have an amazing happy hour. Half off apps and great drink specials. Their house margarita (on the rocks with salt) is deceivingly strong and delicious. They have the only tequila tap in the United States!!Their apps are awesome. The wild mushroom tamale is ridiculous. Highly recommend. The ceviche is amazing especially if you're a fan of lime. And their carne asada plates are impressive. Basically if you're looking for some gourmet Mexican food (I know that sounds lame, but it's true) and some great drinks, give this place a try.

Actually the worst Panera I've ever been to. Went the first time. Told myself to never go back. Was craving a warm sandwich and I always go to the Subway a few doors down, so I thought I'd give Panera one more shot. Bad idea. Paid $10 for a sandwich, waited 15+ minutes for that sandwich (where they make you line up in a hallway - people sneezing right where the food is) The guy behind me was cussing bc he had to wait so long. When I finally got my food, found a cold sandwich that might as well been slapped together, wrapped in paper that looked like someone was crinkling paper to throw in the trash. To top it all off the sandwich STINKS - like smells terrible. Going right in the garbage. I'll never be back.

Stayed here for my sister's wedding. Honestly one of the worst experiences I've had at a hotel. Front desk staff was shockingly incompetent and rude. Sat staring at their computers while we stood in front of them for five minutes without acknowledging us. They didn't even look up to tell us they needed a second. Took us forever to get our rooms and once we did get our rooms, they put us in the wrong one. We thought we lost all of my sister's baggage. Talk about unnecessary stress the day if your wedding. When we came down to try to fix the situation, they tried to blame it on us. The list of head aches they gave us and pretty much all the guests that stayed there for the wedding is too long to go through. It's only saving grace was the exceptionally kind maid staff. Still.. would never, EVERRR recommend this place to anyone. LIKE EVER.

I've been here several times. Beer selection is amazing. They have a great happy hour - probably one of the best on Mill. Pizza is really tasty. I think my issue with this place is their non-pizza food items. First time I ate there, got the Caesar salad - definitely not what I was expecting and I was not a fan. Also ordered the "soft" pretzel with salt - never again. Holy salt and hold the soft. The next time I ate there, I got the spinach artichoke dip, which was tasty while hot, but if you decide to not gobble it down, the texture gets kinda funky as it cools. Also ordered the Capri - mozzarella, basil and balsamic. Probably my favorite non-pizza item but it was still lacking something - more balsamic or some crackers... Idk. All in all... I will be back at least for drinks and happy hour. Jury is still out on the food.

I needed a new air conditioner and air handler, and I wanted a second opinion to compare against a company I have been using for 15 years. My wife suggested I try Bradham Brothers because she has seen their trucks advertising that they have been in business since 1975, and I also went on your website to look at the positive reviews. Not only were they less money, and Randy's presentation and explanations were extremely professional, my original company never followed up. The installation went extremely well, everyone followed up, the office staff has been very accommodating, and a serviceman just left who was wonderful. I strongly recommend that anyone who needs a heating and air conditioning company call Bradham Brothers.

I contacted Wayne with very short notice asking for a professional photo session with head shots for 6 people. Wayne was able to accommodate and we scheduled the session at the time that worked best for my team just a few days later. Wayne was communicative, accommodating, payment was easy, and he made the team feel at ease during the shoot, the quality of the photos were also very good, and receiving the final photos was quick and easy to access. All round I thought Wayne did a great job and I would recommend his services to anyone.

People made this place seem like the best place to get a burger but honestly... it doesn't live up to the hype. Not groundbreaking at all. My boyfriend and I left really disappointed, especially after spending $30 here (2 burgers, fries, and a drink). Definitely not worth the money. It took forever to get our food, and when we did get it, my burger came out wet and soggy? Literally there was water at the bottom of my plate and it was just so unappetizing I couldn't get past three bites (coming from someone who doesn't lose their appetite easily). On top of that, the cashier who was taking my order was giving me dirty looks when I was nothing but polite. Not really sure how I offended her but ok..... 

Bottom line - I don't get annoyed easily but this place is the one exception. Please don't waste your hard earned cash here when there are about a billion other burger joints in this town. So not worth it!!!!!

I'm not an expert on Thai cuisine, but I visited this establishment using a group coupon voucher.  The starters were shrimp wrapped in a taquito-like shell, and a mango salad.  I enjoyed the shrimp, but I found the mango salad was too sweet to be a good appetizer.  For the mains my companion and I ordered a tofu curry and chicken in a cashew sauce with noodles, respectively.  

Nothing unusually striking with my chicken dish.  The flavor was quite acceptable and portion size was good.  My companion didn't have any complaints about the curry dish, and she even brought home the leftovers.  Dessert consisted of two pieces of fried banana and a scoop of coconut ice cream.  Both were quite appealing, though I accidentally got some of the fried banana syrup on my finger.  The syrup was incredibly sticky and I had to wash it off at a sink as merely using a napkin was not enough.

The dining area is small (under 10 tables), and the service was excellent.  I did not see a picture of the Thai king on the wall, which to my understanding every Thai restuarant ought to have.  But it certainly seems like a nice neighborhood place to go to as a repeat customer.

First time at the Nail Room and I must say they are quite awesome! Came in for a full set of Acylics w/ gel and a design. The whole experience from beginning to end was amazing. They do exceptional work and are really caring. What I like the most is I had a couple nails where the gel chipped a little. They got me right in to fix them even though I got my nails done 3 days prior. Excellent customer service and such a cute spot!!

He immediately embraced me and my family with his good nature and straight forward approach.  Together we mapped out a plan that would protect both me and my baby and put me in a position for a successful and healthy pregnancy.  I am so grateful to have found a Dr. who is not only THE expert in his field, but also honest, direct, and tremendously knowledgeable and skilled.

Without hesitation I give the highest recommendation that I could possibly give for this fantastic Dr and his staff.  I wish only that there were more stars available for this review!

I've been tanning for many years, so I know the quality of beds that work well with my skin and this salon does not have any. A few are outdated and still the owner insisted on over charging. Although I'm very disappointed with Custom Tan & Spas tanning beds I know a very good friend who loves the spray tans. Just this week I've referred three potential loyal spray tan customers. Just earlier I witnessed yet another side of Custom Tan & Spas unprofessional customer service from none other than the owner herself Paula Burr.
Paula had shared her personal phone number with me earlier this year so I felt very comfortable texting her at 6pm tonight requesting a spray tan before a vacation tomorrow. Paula responded, " Seriously, I'm off of work. I requested if there was another employee available. She replied, " Seriously, this is my personal phone." Then proceeded to scold me with vulgar language and the most unprofessional attitude I've ever witnessed from a business owner. 
I will not send Custom Spa & Tan anymore business and I strongly urge everyone who considers going to this salon to think twice.

One of my favourite brunch spots for under $20! Fat Pasha is one Anthony Rose's well-known cohort of restaurants on Dupont. I've never been for meals besides brunch, but the restaurant is definitely worth it alone for brunch. 

For 2, I like to order a Salatim (3 for $18) and an entrée (one for less than $20). The red lentil spread with Moroccan spices is divine, and so is the chopper eggplant and tahini. The Liver and Verscht on rye mini sandwich is amazing if you like chopped liver. I'd definitely return to try even more of the appetizers and salatim.

I came in for brunch, really looking forward to the full English breakfast, especially blood pudding! But when I arrived they informed me they've been out of blood pudding for almost two months (something about suppliers). I was definitely disappointed but I still opted to try the full English breakfast set. The set came with a regular sausage, bacon, your choice of eggs, beans, mushrooms, and your choice of bread. The fried toast really stood out to me, great flavour. Unfortunately everything else was all quite bland.

Fantastic little shop with outstanding customer service. I recently obtained a used violin and took it to Music & Arts Center. The staff was super helpful. They checked out my violin for free, showed me how to apply rosin to the bow, and recommended an inexpensive book to get me started. I'll definitely go back there for my musical needs.

The only reason The Real Jerk received two stars is because the soup 
is tasty. If it wasn't I would give them 1 star for the UNACCEPTABLE service.
I no longer live in Toronto and after a long day working on a film down the street I craved 
Jamaican soup. I am Jamaican and can cook my own soup but after a 14 hour day
I remembered The Real Jerk was now up the street. I just wanted take out!
I was directed to the bar by the hostess and saw that someone else was waiting.
We were not acknowledged or spoken to except the " woman " behind the bar
yelling to the hostess to come take our order because her PAD was not working.
This was after some time of just standing wondering if their was a policy I was not 
aware of. A simple greeting, a hello please give me a moment something is wrong with my 
pad and I cannot take your order. Nothing, we waited and waited. Then the young hostess 
came over and I said the other customer was there first. She apologized for keeping us 
waiting. STILL NOTHING FROM THE DISGRUNTLED BARTENDER, the " woman " 
I said, I don't have a problem with having to wait but I do have a problem with attitude.
Absolutely hate when my community, my fellow countrymen are tarnished with the 
same brush as those who have bad manners. There is no reason to be rude in the 
service industry, absolutely no excuse. We are the customer and a simple Hello
would have gone a long way. Oh did I mention a kiss teeth! when I stated the entire 
restaurant did not to be a part of the drama over a key PAD. My LAST Visit.

My 2 stars are for my most recent expeerience with Quince Flowers. I have used them many times for conveniance and for their selection on non traditional floral arrangements and plants. Yes their customer service is sometimes sketchy but whatever, I am pretty good at knowing exactly what I want in person and long distance ordering. This time it was a very special occassion and it wasn't about size or grandour but the right choice. I needed their help because it was a call in order and to say I was disppointed at how my very clear request was interpretated is an understatement. What made the lazy choice for a big birthday and specail occassion even worse was the response. Sorry it was not to your taste.......no how about your associate didn't listen and missed the boat entirely on what I asked for. The 2 stars are for past gifts that were bang on. You have lost a long standing customer QUINCE.

I am giving this place a 4 star because the food is great and they do it in a very special way. I mean they cooked the food in front of you and they do it according to your preference. The staff are very welcoming and they made sure that you are very comfortable. They offer you right away something to start and not make you wait. The only thing that made me not go there more often is the price. This place is not really for people who are a bit tight but rest assured that you get what you spent.

The place is awesome, the service is unbelievable, thanks to the management for a job well done. 

I only give 4 stars because it is too impossible to be perfect. The food is great except for some that I don't like. The ambience is perfect for everyone except if you have kids because it is a little too loud but I don't discredit them for that. The crablet is my favorite, the rolls, and the fish are beyond expectation.

I did take out orders and by the way, I have to pick it up because they don't do delivery. I can't believe how fast they are in preparing my orders especially I did it on holidays. Good job guys and I would definitely recommend you to all of my friends to get the chance to know how impeccable the service and  how mouth watering are the foods. 

The only problem here is the parking. It is very limited as it is located along the street. I am always lucky to get one everytime I visited this place.

The place is a little bit small considering that a lot of people goes there for lunch or dinner. The ambiance is quite off. The crews are great and very helpful.

This clinic is horrible and insensitive. They only care about money and nothing more. Did several treatments trying to give them a chance but results aren't to satisfaction. The only thing they're good at is selling you package. I told them that I am not seeing results but they keep on selling me still and trying to convince me that I need more session which I already did. Don't go to this place. Money grab!!!!!

10 months ago I experienced sudden shedding of my hair but I just ignored it knowing that it is part of my stress at work. Day by day, I've been trying to check my hair line and receding area and I noticed that it is slowly going until to my surprise that my shedding is getting worst. 

I did some research and consulted a dermatologist but only advised me to take some medications which i did followed for a month with no results at all. I opted to consult a naturopathic doctor and same thing happened. I almost lost hope until I found this clinic. I went there for a consultation and the consultant did a visual analysis of my scalp to find out if my follicle is still active or not. He was very informative and detailed as he knew that I am very anxious about my condition. After the assessment he advised me to do the treatment and I quickly signed up for everything that he offered although I dont know if this will help me or not. I am so desperate at that time but he make me feel at ease.

4months after I started the program to my delight, my hair loss stopped and I started noticing some regrowth. I didn't expected such a short time I will notice the difference. He again did the follow up and suggested to do the PRP which I decided to go right away as he is the guy that don't lie but only look after the best for you. I am very pleased with the service and I will update you folks again in 3 months time as he will do my follow up again.

The place is very clean and the staff are very helpful and great.

As far as laser clinics go , bellair is great. Remember these places open and close daily. I was surprised to learn theyve been around for 9 yrs. great! So far my treatments have been successful. After my third laser hair removal treatment results are great. That may change, but good so far. I will update with my fifth treatment. Place is clean and comfortable. I look forward to seeing what happens next. 
All indications are good, and if thats the case i may try some other services

So I did a very stupid thing and accidentally topped off my oil with antifreeze (It was dark! The containers are very similar!). I discovered YourMechanic while trying to figure out how to get my oil changed without starting the engine and driving somewhere. It was easy and convenient to make a next-day appointment online. I knew right up front what the cost would be (and was delighted to find it was even bit *cheaper* than my usual mechanic). Josh called to confirm and follow-up on my specific problem. He arrived right on time and was professional, friendly and efficient. He didn't try to upsell me on anything or talk down to me (ladies, you know this feeling at the garage, amiright?). The whole thing took less than an hour and was basically like having a really competent gear-head friend whom you could ask to come fix things for you. It doesn't get any better than this!

I wanted to like this place, I really did.  In town from CA to help some family members move, and the Great Dane is right down the street.  Went there Fri and Sat nights for a few pints and carry out.  Fri night - nice atmosphere, nice time, and a very good steak salad to go.  Sat night - ruined by an entire soccer team of 10 year old kids coming in during the Michigan football game and sitting at the bar.  On college football Saturday at 6:45pm?  Really?  What "pub" allows kids to sit at the bar on a Saturday night?  And we're talking 15 kids, I counted.  Hello, manager?  How do the 10 year old boys sitting around the bar on Saturday night help your bottom line?  Totally ruined my experience there.  Oh, and the cheddar mac w/ buffalo chicken that I ordered to go basically sucked.  Should've stuck w/ the steak salad.

Luxurious. But of course, you'd expect that from the Bellagio.

Chi, my pedicurist, was wonderful. Super sweet and very attentive. She took her time with the scrub and massage; after a couple of days in Vegas, it was heavenly. When it was all over, I was kicking myself for not scheduling additional services - I didn't want to leave!

Four stars instead of five because:
- The ladies in reception were a bit rude, both over the phone and more so in person. 
- My pedicure only lasted two days! A pedicure from anywhere else easily lasts me 2, even 3 weeks without a single chip.

Asked specifically if they used Breadworks bread and was told they did, but when I goy my sandwich it was on plain old square bland wheat bread. Very disappointing. Also the pepsi tasted flat and/or diluted. May be a good place to go after bars close and you're so drunk you can't tell what you're eating but I wouldn't recommend it.

I was just so pleased and satisfied with my meal I had to write about it! Initially I meant to get one of this restaurants famous crepes, however after learning they served breakfast until 2pm and spying their new breakfast menu, I found I simply could not resist their house omelette with prosciutto & Brie!! Two of my favorite special foods in one perfect omelette. 
I arrived at what must be one of their busiest times, and after some initial confusion as to who was lining up for take out and who was lining up to be seated I joined the correct line and waited only about 4-5 mins before a very pleasant hostess greeted me. 
I was on my own and was seated immediately at a lovely, comfortable corner booth/table. Guessing they would be too busy to make it to me quickly I put my coffee order in with her. By the time I returned from the bathroom (v well kept!) a server was bringing my coffee order. 
I had had a chance to review the menu while waiting and put my order in immediately.  The male server was friendly and efficient and I was left to my own devices to wait for my food. I watched the staff moving back and forth in this small establishment with ease and dexterity realizing they had a well oiled machine! I looked around and appreciated the simple decor was very clean & well maintained. 
My server came over with more coffee apologizing for the delay (a party of 6 had been seated just before me, but after he returned to my table with more cream another server brought my dish out! (Also apologizing) I should note that I did not feel like I had been waiting long at all. 
It was beautifully plated with a very fresh spinach and mixed greens salad and the gorgeous, thick balsamic dressing in a tiny metal dispenser on the side. My choice of toast was also served up, perfectly toasted and buttered just slightly so as to also enjoy a side of jam. 
My meal was excellent and very well priced at $11.50, and, as only a good meal can I left with a big smile on my face despite the rainy day I walked out to.

Equity Trust was my FIRST AND LAST experience with a self-directed IRA account.    If I could give Equity Trust  zero stars, or less than that, I would.  After deciding to close my account,  Equity Trust sat on my transfer request for more than 2 months!
Because I had liquidated the majority of my stock holdings intending to purchase real estate, most of my account was in cash.  Equity Trust MADE EXCUSES AND LIED  about having to check an issue with the IRS before transferring my  cash from my IRA account to my IRA account at another firm.  I threatened to contact the OH State Attorney General Office.  Even the other firm, one of the largest, most reputable firms in the business, said Equity Trust is one of the "most challenging smaller firms."
Do yourself a favor and invest elsewhere!

One of my favs spot to chill whenever I'm in Vegas. It's away from the main but yet close enough.  The price is fair on the cheap side with decent services.

HORRIBLE(but read on for the details). Ok, this one is a bit long winded, but a definite MUST READ. My AC went out over night on a Saturday. I called One Hour when I woke up at 5:00 a.m. to see the ac wasn't working. They said the earliest they could get to me was from 12 a.m. to 4 a.m early Monday! Well, I guess I had no choice. Lucky for me Sunday was filled with Thunderstorms so the high was only 95.

Guy ends up coming at 1 a.m. making Monday's work day awesome....

Flash forward to Monday afternoon when I get off and come home. The AC wont go down below 77 now. Call back, they come see me Tuesday between 6-10. 

Everything seems to be working fine when now come Saturday again, the AC stops working again, turning on for 15 seconds, then off for 15 seconds, and over and over, not going below 77 again!

Bottom Line: It is impossible to get a time for them to come out. They are can get nasty on the phone when you tell them their service is unacceptable. Plus, nobody can tell me why the heck they have "One-Hour" in their name! 

Side note, I paid $7,800 for the A/C unit from them and it isn't even 4 years old and I am having these issues. Plus, I get my vents cleaned by them and all.

One of the most amazing meals I've had the pleasure to enjoy.  As you've read, this is a tasting meal, we didn't have any of the dishes previously mentioned as they have a rotating menu.  

You get to see the chefs at work and they are also very nice and as we learned a lot of fun.  The service is impeccable and incredibly knowledgeable.

This is not  priced for the faint of heart - $100 for the 5-course menu / $175 for the 8-course and $250 for the 14-course menu.  I will say as others have posted, don't think that you'll be hungry after this meal, we ordered the 5-course and were full.  The dessert was AMAZING and was accompanied by a chocolate flight.

Side Note - Conrad is - I believe - the Manager - and he was sensational - a great host and ambassador for the restaurant!

Had "The Shack" breakfast burrito. Probably the best one I've had in a while. Usually I can't finish the entire thing but it was so darn good I couldn't stop.

The Shack, with a Mtn Dew at 830 in the morning is a good start to a Saturday!

Location is really awesome as well, it truly is a shack. Cool decor and makes you feel like your somewhere else!

The food was pretty tasty but what makes this a five star for me is that the staff were also very personalable. The stuffed pepper was oh so good. We got our food to go and had a picnic at the beach (forgot utensils but had napkins) and it was simply a really good experience.

I had their London Fog variation (forget the name) and it was delightful. The set up is a bit cramped but that's because it's a smaller shop. We went late and had seats but I imagine they might run out quickly. It had a good playlist at the time giving a nice ambiance but that is dependent on who sets it. It is definitely worth checking out if you are a tea buff. The way they infuse the leaves and water is interesting but that novelty will wear off, moreso if you are rushing. You'd be returning simply because they have good tea and a large selection. 

Tl:dr large selection of flavourful teas (and coffee), infuser is interesting but will upset impatient people, good ambience in a smallish venue

The pizza looked old when i walked in. Maybe it's better to order it fresh... I got the chicken schwarma which came with some wilting veggies and layers of sauce. It... Tastes as if the sauce is compensating for the lack of flavour in the chicken. Yes it is cheap and probably a staple. You're not coming here for top shelf food. It's the draw of schwarma on pizza... 
More like 2.5 but i don't see how this deserves a four star

I had the fish n chips to go so I'm mostly speaking on how I really liked it. The slaw was one I could eat and I hate slaw. It is a more upscale place than I am use to. The ambience was nice, quieter, something I expect more in the suburbs actually. The patio looks like I will be returning in the summer especially for the nachos. Good date place I think. 
Fish was large and tasty and the tartar was something I could eat. I also don't normally do tartar.

I don't know why this is four stars...
My food came out well before my partners. One might assume eggs benny on waffles would take less time than steak and eggs but maybe it was because when i asked for medium they gave it rare. The home fries looked like they were McCain fries and the eggs were bland. I had to send the steak back the first time. When the steak was cooked more (still under done), it was quite frankly disgusting. Not the seasoning per se but the meat was very bad. They said something is wrong with the supplier, so until it is resolved stay away. I took a bite and put it aside. 
The eggs benny... Well I mean wow these were terrible. The sauce was lackluster and strangely textured (congealed a bit?) on top of cooked centre poached eggs. The yolk should be runny. The waffle also tasted like it was out of a packet. I don't care if (cheap) food is store bought but it should have some pizzazz at least. 
The customer service could have been better. Maybe it was that she was new and the amount of tables were too much. She was friendly enough i suppose. 
Oh and the latte sucked. 

TL:dr terrible food.  Just ... Terrible

This was the worst experience I have ever had.  I purchased a car that then had issues within the first 24 hours.  I took it back as they gave me the impression I had a 10 day return period.  Turns out it was just an exchange period so after many wasted hours I am still without a car and they will not refund the $2,750 I have give to them.  The owner, Jack, just keeps telling me to come pick up my BMW....which I said lets exchange many times to.  I've gone twice and spent hours looking for something else and they have nothing so then I was told I was being difficult and my expectations were too high.  NOTE:  If you buy a car from these guys you must have LOW EXPECTATIONS!  I strongly recommend you DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS PLACE!!!!

Worst service ever.  We went in to eat at 4pm on a Sunday and there were only a few tables and about 8 waitstaff so we should have had perfect service.  Instead the staff stood around gossiping and we never got drink refills and waited forever for our check.  On top of that we were very unimpressed with the food.  My boyfriend had a salad that was $18.50 and the corn in it looked old and his salmon way over cooked.

Worst furniture nightmare of my life!  Absolutely do NOT buy from these guys if you are planning on having your furniture delivered!  They showed up exactly at midnight on a Sunday and left damaged furniture that I tried to refuse.  They were supposed to send someone back the next day to pick up.  It has now been 4 days and I have taken 2 days off work for their so called scheduled pickup times only for them not to show up.  Absolutely ridiculous!!!  I lost more money in wage from unpaid work time then this was worth!

Geez. There seems to be some negative buzz surrounding this place. Most of the stuff I read made it seem like there wasn't any shot of much good coming out of it. So, imagine my surprise when the food was good, the service was attentive, and the overall experience was one that I'd come back for.

In all fairness, a lot of that negative stuff I read was about their Theatre district location on King West, which I've neer been to, but that just doesn't hold much value for me. The fact is, most of those places on that strip of King seem to get a bad rap. Get 'em in, get 'em fed, get 'em out; that's their philosophy as they wait for theatre goers to arrive, and then again when they hope for them to come back after the show... thankfully, Hey Lucy's Annex location isn't anything like that.

With their soft lighting, chandeliers and black-and-white cow print seats, it's difficult to describe what exactly they were going for when they designed this place, but somehow, it works well and provides a nice backdrop, particularly for a date night. The ambience is hip, the decor is comfortable and cozy, and the space is of a decent enough size that it can easily accommodate both large groups and couples.

Hey Lucy is busy in the summer evenings, mostly because of their killer patio that lines the entire side of the building. Perfect for people-watching, this packed space is a nice addition to The Annex, and it holds up well against other patios on the street (except for Pauper's Pub!).

Probably what Hey Lucy is most well-known for is their martinis. They've got a pretty decent martini menu with some interesting things on it, like the Godzilla and the Freedom 55, but man, these guys are expensive. Although they do come with a minimum of 2 ounces of booze, you can expect to shell out 9 bucks plus taxes for one. And while that may seem ok at first, having a few of them can easily add up... trust me on that. If martinis are your thing, but getting ripped off for them isn't, then you're definitely going to want to come back on a Wednesday. Wednesday is Martini Wednesday at Hey Lucy, and the prices drop to 4 bucks for the exact same martinis. But come early, other people like a good deal when they see one too, and this place fills up pretty quickly.

Their menu doesn't follow any sort of style; it's a bit all over the place, but it's still the sorta thing you might expect from a place like this. Pastas, wood-fired pizzas, paninis, sandwiches, all of it is pretty good, but unfortunately, this can unexpectedly change once the place fills up. In Hey Lucy's case, it's better to go when it isn't that busy.

While I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Hey Lucy, if you're in the area and looking for a night out, Hey Lucy provides nicely.

I'd read much about Woodlot in the last few months: about the fantastic bakery, the locally-sourced ingredients, the simplicity of the food and decor. Between the personal recommendations and the fawning of the print and online food community, the decision wasn't too hard to make to try it out. (The fact that it was voted one of the best new restaurants of 2011 by Toronto Life definitely didn't hurt.)

We popped into Kalendar for a drink beforehand (check out the rojo martini if you go. Most excellent.) and watched the world go by, including the chef of Grace, Top Chef Canada contestant Dustin Gallagher. Mental note: must get to Grace! We wandered over to Woodlot and as soon as we opened the door, the aroma from that spectacular wood-burning oven wafted over us. Figuring that was a good sign, we inhaled deeply and sat down at our cozy table. The restaurant looks like it seats about 50 on the upper floor with room for another 10 or so downstairs at the chef's table. The exposed brick walls are adorned with native Canadian art as well as knickknacks that lend a cottage-like vibe to the place. The waiters are dressed casually and it is explained to us that there is a standard menu, plus a separate vegetarian menu. I perused it quickly and was impressed to find a nice selection that didn't fit into the standard roast-veg-or-pasta options.

We ordered a bottle of cabernet franc and eventually settled on three courses: the scallop ceviche with black quinoa, whipped avocado and julienned red cabbage; Red Fife whole wheat papardelle with wood mushrooms and hazeluts; whey-fed pork chop with grilled treviso, tri-tip steak with caramelized onions and side of Jerusalem artichokes.

When the bread basket arrived at the table after placing our order, we jumped right in. My dining companion loves bread and watching his face light up after taking that first bite of the gorgeous Red Fife bread was wonderful! I'd read about this particular grain in Sara Elton's book, Locavore, and was excited to check it out. It kind of makes regular bread taste entirely pathetic. We'd both had a couple of pieces of the various kinds when the appetizer arrived. The scallops were soft, the avocado was whipped into a lovely, airy bubble and these textures were complimented well with the crunchy quinoa and cabbage. I wish there'd been more of it, but we weren't exactly going to starve.

Next up was the papardelle which was out of this world. Again, the Red Fife made a huge difference in terms of flavour. The wide, handmade noodles were cooked perfectly and provided much more dimension to the dish than you'd have otherwise. It was a very earthy plate, one that you wanted to hunker down with in front of a fire and never stop eating. I hope that's on the menu year 'round, because I would have it again and again.

The service at Woodlot is quite good, if not entirely exceptional. Importantly, however, they let you enjoy your meal in peace and the timing in between courses is well paced. We needed a little time between the hearty pasta and giant slabs of meat that would imminently arrive at our table. And giant slabs of meat they were: delicious, juicy, perfectly-cooked pieces of meat. My pork chops had that little layer of fat around the outside that you know you probably shouldn't eat, but can't help yourself because you know how good it is. The grilled treviso was a perfect compliment, too. The steak was exactly medium-rare as  ordered and was incredibly tender. The caramelized onions were an excellent accompaniment - in fact, I'd eat a whole bowl of those if they sold them. Even the Jerusalem artichokes were great - caramelized and not overcooked.

To say that we savoured every bite is not an understatement. Nothing was complicated (though I have a spot in my heart for complex food) or overwrought: in fact, we saw several dishes come out on wooden cutting boards. Dessert was very tempting, but we passed this time. I'd like to go back in the cooler months as I'm dying to try the marrow-infused whipped potatoes.  Of course, I also want to go back so I can eat ALL the bread that's there.

So there you have it. Great food, cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It's tough to get reservations on a weekend, but the hostess with whom I spoke to make our reservations was gracious and as accommodating as could be. I will definitely be making return trips here!

A neighbourhood staple, Lahore Tikka House is located on Gerrard East in the heart of little India. They do one thing and do it well: Halal Pakistani cuisine. The space is fairly plain, the decor is mostly barebones, and they've been 'under renovations' for the last few years. Despite that, this place seems to run seamlessly and churns some serious Indian food. Outdoors they have a large patio where the huge indoor space can spill over to in the warmer months once the restaurant gets busy, which it inevitably does. If the seating is full and there's a line at the door, no worries, this place has a great takeout service, which I usually get. Just call ahead, and it's usually piping hot and set for pickup in about 20 minutes.

Flaky with hint of spice and smokiness, Lahore's samosas are better than your average samosas on the Gerrard. But my usual order includes the Vegetable Biryani. It's a huge portion of perfectly cooked Basmati rice, tomaotes, peppers, cauliflower, chickpeas, potatoes, and a mild blend of tumeric, cumin, and chili powder. I also love their Paneer cheese. The squeaky Indian cheese is an unaged curd cheese that is denser than tofu, but seems to absorb flavours just the same.  Lahore serves their Paneer Tikka Masala, and in my opinion, it's the city's best. Lightly seared and tandoor, it's served in a smoky, slightly spicy sauce; it's made the way it should be. And of course, be sure to order a side of their naan bread. Not only is it lightly oiled, seasoned, and softly charred, but it's also perfect for making sure you soak up all of the sauce.

Next time you're looking for some Indian food, forget all those 'all you can eat' buffets and head to Lahore Tikka House on Gerrard East. It sets the bar pretty high for good Indian food in Toronto.

There sure are a lot of tea places showing up nowadays, especially since the monstrous success of David's Tea. Say what you will about that corporate beast, but in my opinion, David's Tea has had a firm hand in pushing tea into the hands of mainstream Toronto. So, in a market on its way to becoming pretty heavily saturated, what's Tea Blendz doing to differentiate themselves? Plenty...

First off, it's not a corporate beast. It's a little boutique shop owned by Khadija, an incredibly nice person whose passion for all things tea-related is almost contagious. That feeling of non-corporateness runs throughout the experience at Tea Blendz. Khadija is easily approachable, encourages you to ask questions, and is obviously passionate about the stuff she's selling. Not to say that the staff at those corporate places aren't passionate, but at Tea Blendz, it just seemed more honest.

They also have a pretty kick-ass teaspresso machine--one of the only ones in Toronto right now I'm told. Basically, it allows them to quick-press loose-leaf tea rather then steep it. That means you can get it faster and cleaner, and the whole process is under more control of the brewer rather than being at the mercy of the boiling water. Your tea will still take a few minutes, but those few minutes can easily be spent talking to the warm and pleasant staff. In fact, I ended up staying and chatting about tea and the neighbourhood for far longer than those few minutes that my tea was pressed.

Using the teaspresso machine, Tea Blendz also brews up some pretty amazing tea lattes. Khadija claimed they were the best in the city, and I can't say I'd disagree with her. While I'm self-admittedly not a tea or tea latte expert by any means, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I could definitely see myself going out of my way to enjoy another one.

Khadija works with local tea blenders to come up with a lot of her blends. They have plenty of classic flavours, like Earl Grey, English Breakfast, and Bourbon Street Vanilla, and some of that are hers and the blenders creation, like Chocolate Mint Delight, Root Beer Rooibos, and Sweet Pumpkin Spice. Despite being pressed and not steeped, the subtle flavours that the tea descriptions promised were still prevalent. I also picked up on a slight sweetness, which amazingly highlighted the even subtler flavours in the tea. All-in-all, I'd sort of equate it to wine-tasting; after tasting it, discussing the tea and its flavours seemed almost natural.

Khadija mentioned that there's a growing trend in food and tea pairing. Because of that, I wondered if she planned on offering any food at some point, which right now she doesn't. I don't mean sitting down and eating a club sandwich and fries, but a small, one-bite of something that was specifically made just to be paired with a particular tea would certainly have been interesting. But Tea Blendz just opened a month ago, so things aren't yet set in stone.

All-in-all, I had a great chat with Khadija. I learned some stuff, and I even left with a few bags of tea. I brought home a bag of Chocolate Mint Delight and the Sweet Pumpkin Spice, and at 5 bucks for 50 grams, I left feeling pretty good about buying it.

So if you're in the neighbourhood, this honest-to-goodness, non-corporate boutique shop is definitely worth checking out and supporting. Even if you're not in the neighbourhood, it's worth the drive if you want to learn more about tea and if you appreciate truly nice customer service.

If you venture away from the downtown core, just outside the hustle and bustle of the 9-5 crowd, the theatres and skyscrapers, you might just find a restaurant that is surprisingly unique and that shows some real passion. You can still see the CN Tower, but it all seems far removed from the tourist-focused mentality. Preparing food requires creativity and there is no better place for the chefs of Parkette to find artistic inspiration than on Queen West beside Trinity Bellwoods Park.

A very tiny restaurant, Parkette offers an equally small, very succinct menu with starters, second courses, salads, pasta, pizza mains and desserts. The server tells me, "our dishes are meant to be shared, like family-style," and so we did.

A meal for two should typically be made of three dishes; a starter, a salad and a main or a "second" and two mains, and so on. They offer, what I would call, up-to-date traditional Italian food. Our starter of mussels in tomato broth, topped with fennel and white beans ($10), was just light enough to leave room for the heavier mains of beef cheeks on bed of polenta ($16) and ricotta gnocchi with oxtail ($14). The beef was tender enough that only a fork was needed to pull the pieces apart and, though not experienced with polenta, I thought it was appropriately soft and that it held up to the rich beef. 

As mentioned in previous reviews, I am a new gnocchi-addict. Parkette's was not so dumpling-like as I've had before and it was certainly not topped with your typical pasta sauce. Little packets of tender potato, assumingly kept so soft by the ricotta, were paired with oxtail and sun-dried tomatoes in more of an aus jus, than a sauce. I think I had a bit more than my fair share of that dish - at a $14 price-point, this was the best of the night. The ingredients are bold, but the layered flavours hold up perfectly. 

Humble, but delicious, Parkette offers carefully prepared food in a great atmosphere; natural woods, stemless wine glasses and paper napkins prevent the tiny interior from becoming claustrophobic. Parkette does almost make you feel like you're having a lovely dinner in the park.

Earl's is nestled amongst the business giants at King and University and was teeming with suits and loosened ties on the Thursday night I paid a visit.  The place was packed, and I soon realized that this was not only attributed to its convenient location.  Earl's serves up some seriously good food.
 I'll be totally honest right out of the gate and say that I rarely frequent chain restaurants.  If I do, it's because it's for a birthday or office party where the show of hands wins.  Chain restaurants don't usually sell me on coming back for more.  Earl's did.

We started with the Tuna Poke Nachos ($11.50).  Served on crispy wontons, and loaded with cubed raw tuna, cucumber, avocado and tomato, they looked like they would be a task to eat.  I envisioned myself taking a bite and (if the toppings made it as far as my mouth without falling off) having it crumble, leaving me with half of a naked nacho, or in this case, wonton.  They surprised me though by maintaining their structure (and toppings).  The spicy mango coulis they were drizzled in leant a nice kick with some crushed macadamia nuts paying tribute to the Hawaiian roots of the dish. I'm not normally a big fan of sushi, but in this case the texture of the tuna and avocado married nicely with the crispiness of the wontons.

Next was the Gnocchi with Italian Rose Sauce ($10.50).  I love gnocchi, but it is associated with being too heavy and too filling often because, well, it usually is.  Not in this case.  Earl's handmade potato gnocchi was the perfect consistency throughout.  Consistent consistency if you will.  And true we shared it, but it was a generous portion and neither of us felt weighted down afterwards.  That wasn't the best part though.  The title of the dish doesn't do it justice.  This gnocchi isn't served in just any ordinary rose sauce... it's served in a rose sauce made of San Marzana tomatoes, burrata cheese and fresh basil.  This, my friends, is the Margharita pizza of gnocchi.  Enough said.

Being ambitious (see: gluttonous), we welcomed the Pulled Pork Sandwich ($13.50) and Potato & Leek Soup ($7) to our table.  I'll start with the soup...although in reality that wasn't the sequence of events.  The soup was creamy and filled with chunks of potato (skin still on...because that's where all the vitamins are!).  It was good, but let's face it, it didn't compare to the main event of this course.  Even halved, our plates were dwarfed.  This is one behemoth of a sandwich.  Piled with tender BBQ braised pork and coleslaw then dressed with a fiery chipotle mayo, this sandwich was a nice balance of spicy and sweet.  It was messy like it should be so keep the napkins close at hand.  I had almost reached my limit but I knew dessert was on the way, so I exercised some will power (says the girl on her third course) and left a few bites on my plate.  I would be lying if I said I wasn't sad to see it go.

You might think that by this point we were too full to even consider the possibility of dessert, and by daily caloric standards, we probably should have been.  But we laughed in the face of those standards and pushed onward...onward to Warm Gingerbread Cake ($8).  Rarely do I find myself at a loss for words, but this cake found me there.  It might have had something to do with the fact that my mouth was full of the aforementioned cake, but also because it was really, really good.  I could use a plethora of colourful adjectives to describe this cake (see: heavenly, divine, decadent) but it all feels so cliché, and none of them would do it justice anyway, so I'm sticking with good.  Damn good.  It was served warm (as promised), drizzled with salted caramel sauce and with sides of brown sugar apple slices and vanilla bean gelato.  Now on any given day, I'll take a cookie over a slice of cake, but not on this day (or any day going forward where I'm given the choice between a cookie and this particular cake).  It was impossibly moist and as we ate it we debated about what made it so.  We came to the conclusion that... well, we didn't really come to any conclusion, except that it was killer, and we would be back for more.  Whoever is slicing the cake at Earl's isn't stingy (bless their soul) but that was one plate that went back to the kitchen devoid of crumbs.

Now Earl's isn't the place to go for a quiet date.  The people are loud (because there are a lot of them), and the music is loud (because it fights to be heard over the people), but the food is excellent and the service, equally so.  It's a hike from my house in High Park to the Financial District, but one I'm willing to make again.  Three words folks... warm, gingerbread, cake.  Do yourself a favour.

Have you ever walked into a restaurant and thought to yourself, "Well, this is going to be different"? It's an exciting feeling that doesn't happen all that often; but, walking into Guu Izakaya on Church St., I was definitely overcome by that thought.  Everyone who enters and exits gets a loud greeting and goodbye from the entire staff. A bit overwhelming, but it certainly sets the tone for your evening. The place is an absolute nuthouse in the best possible way.

That evening, my two companions and I were lucky enough to get seats within a few minutes upon arriving, a rare feat as I understand it. Guu features communal dining, with long tables that seat around 15 - 20 people, as well as seats at the bar where you can watch the chefs work. There is a two-hour time limit for diners and often a 1-2 hour wait for a seat. If you can, go early or prepare to cool your heels for a while. I promise you that it will be worth it.

My friends had been to Guu before so they did the bulk of the ordering. They chose the best dishes they'd had before and also took cues from our tablemates who'd ordered some fascinating fare. The menu is set up tapas-style, a fantastic way to sample all sorts of delicious creations. We ordered eight dishes for the three of us which was just about right and all were quite reasonably priced.

The first to arrive was the decidedly (and awesomely) decadent deep-fried brie served with a mango and blueberry sauce.  The four pyramid-shaped morsels were golden and crispy on the outside and gooey, rich deliciousness on the inside. Like, eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-your-head-good. Next up: the salmon sashimi. Melt in your mouth greatness. It's one of those simple dishes that really sings based on the merits of great, high quality ingredients.

On to the bacon-wrapped scallops and enoki mushrooms. Holy. Smokes. Bacon-wrapped anything is a winner in my books but here the contrasting textures played against each other so beautifully. Paired with the salty pork, the sweet scallop and earthy mushrooms, this dish was so good that it was tempting to cancel the rest of our order and have nothing but this for the rest of the night.

The beef carpaccio was placed before our wide eyes next and it was a lovely, bright contrast to the richness of the dish before. Served with with ponzu, wasabi, mayo & garlic chips, this rare beef was light and, somehow, refreshing. It was nice to have a lighter bite after the richness of the scallops before.

It was at this point in our meal that I noticed a crowd of waiters pause from their constant, frenetic activity. Then I spotted a server with a slice of cake with a candle in it. Guu's birthday celebrations put Chuck E. Cheese to shame. Not only did the wait staff lead the entire restaurant in a rousing rendition of "Happy Birthday", encouraging everyone to clap and sing along, but even the insanely busy chefs joined in. At one point, they had the lights flickering on and off. Utter celebrational pandemonium and it was amazing.

Once the place had settled down a little (to be clear, Guu is the least settled place on the planet), the strangest creation of the evening appeared at our table. It was roughly the size of a softball, deep fried and had a wooden knife protruding from the centre. We wracked our brains trying to figure out if we had actually ordered it, decided we hadn't and dug in anyway. What it turned out to be was a Japanese scotch egg with a layer of pureed pumpkin surrounding a hard-boiled egg. While I was skeptical initially - I'm not a big pumpkin fan, much to the horror of many of my friends - the combination of the creamy pumpkin, rich egg, crispy exterior and tangy sauce was downright addictive. We just about scraped the plate without chopsticks long after other dishes had been cleared away.

When the spare ribs arrived, it was all I could do to refrain from gobbling them all up myself. The marinated beef was tender and salty, having surely been marinated for quite some time. If you're a fan of spare ribs, these are a can't-miss.

The final dishes of the night were the decadent, baked oysters and the light, miso-glazed black cod. We ordered the oysters because we saw them arrive for another group at our table and they looked so unique! Kind of a twist on oysters Rockefeller, they're served with spinach and mushrooms, smothered in a potent mayo-garlic sauce and topped with melted cheese...all in a giant shell. This was a thing of glorious, messy beauty. The mushrooms nestled in there made for an umami bomb of a bite. Definitely give this one a shot, my friends. It's weird and tasty and I've never seen it anywhere else.

Not only was this one of the best meals I've had all year, it was by far and away the most fun. Unquestionably, the company helped but the atmosphere at Guu is like none other. It's not the place to go for a quiet, intimate dinner; it's the place to go when you want to try innovative, playful and truly remarkable dishes.

If any description of this dessert-centric restaurant fits, it is "the resolution-killer" that rings the truest.

This is a sit-down restaurant offering a wide variety of sweets.  The menu is a full three panel - front and back - array of original creations, ranging from the unique and beautiful Lazy Sundaes to the Scoop du Jour - one or two scoops with cream and cherries.  Of course, you can also just select from the many offered toppings and ice cream flavours to create-your-own.  Ice cream includes peanut butter, nutello chocolate (not to be confused with Nutella) and vanilla-honey, amongst others.  On top of that, they throw in a freshly made crepe or waffle, some bananas or strawberries, chocolate sauce and a couple of dollops of the clearly-in-house-made whipped cream, and you have a dessert that will put you in a delightful sugar coma!

It was close to 11:00 p.m. when I made my way to Demetre's, but there were still a good number of sweet-toothed patrons enjoying some of the sugary creations - this was clearly be more than your regular two-scoop waffle-cone kind of place.  They make all of the ice creams on the premises, using fresh Ontario dairy and utilizing a special freezing process that prevents ice crystals from forming in the carefully crafted artisan frozen treats.

The servings provide you more than enough ice cream and extras to share comfortably, but my group decided to be gluttonous and each have their own; three ice cream crepe dishes, one with peanut butter ice cream, one nutello chocolate and one with the house chocolate.  The best thing about these desserts, right down to the whipped cream, is the balance of sweetness with the bold flavours.  There is a truly special way they do things that prevents the strong flavours from overwhelming the whole dish.  The peanut butter ice cream was nowhere near that almost sticky consistency and too-rich taste that can be attached to some PB creations; the whipped cream was a clean and creamy compliment to the light chocolate syrup; and the fruit was fresh and surprisingly bright considering the winter months.

I am a self-proclaimed cheap dessert-eater, but here I felt like I got much more than I paid for.  The dishes come in at about $10 each - but, if you're sharing, which is probably more appropriate than polishing off a whole plate alone, it is quite affordable - especially for the top-notch quality.

The cherry on top was the service.  It was fast, friendly, and appropriately attentive.  A few casual checks were done here and there and an offer for re-fills was made - so simple, but so important.

If you haven't done so yet, check out Café Demetre. It's a sweet spot to get some sweets.

Sweet Flour bakeshop is a tremendously original idea. It's a custom bakeshop in Bloor West Village that revolves primarily around the cookie. Their website lays out their philosophy best: there is nothing quite like a cookie just out of the oven. That cookie, just out of the oven, and the experience that goes along with its creation, is exactly what Sweet Flour is all about. I say 'revolves primarily around the cookie' because although your perfect cookie is their goal, they don't stop at cookies. Everything from homemade granola to muffin tops and ice cream sandwiches to gingerbread is there for you to claim and customize as your own. For me, Sweet Flour delivers the experience of one of my best-remembered childhood memories: watching cookies bake through the oven window and patiently waiting for them to cool just enough to eat.

So what exactly does it mean to 'customize' cookies? At Sweet Flour, it means you're in charge of what's getting made. It all starts by picking what you want to bake. You can choose muffin or cookie batter, and from a couple variations of either of those, but your best bet is probably the classic cookie. It's perfectly sweet with hint of vanilla and butter. From there you decide what you want in the cookie; trust me, it won't be an easy decision to make. There are tons of different treats ranging from chunks of chocolate to crunchy nuts to soft dried fruits. You get a choice of two. Then they mix it, form it, and bake it ultra fast. Your cookie is perfectly hot and baked and in your hands in about two minutes.

Sweet Flour doesn't just stop at custom cookies. They also cater parties with baked goods, bake and decorate custom cookies for events, do cookiegram deliveries, and even package their cookies into kid's loot bags.

One thing is made perfectly clear from the minute you walk in until the minute you step out the door; these people care about quality. Everything in use seems fresh and high grade. From the glass bottled locally source milk to the fair-trade coffee to those incredible cookie ingredients, all of it seems to be bought with both quality and you in mind. A rare outlook nowadays when everything seems to be about the bottom line.

The aspect about Sweet Flour I immediately noticed is that their space has expansion written all over it. I'm sure this is the only one, but the layout, decorating, even the logo, all of it made it feel strangely familiar, like I was somehow used to it. This place definitely screams franchise, and I wouldn't be shocked to eventually see one downtown, at the mall, even at the airport. While that certainly isn't a bad thing for the business, I personally felt as though it sort of takes away from the connection to my childhood feeling.

I know there are a couple more places in Toronto that do the same sort of custom cookie experience that Sweet Flour does, but I'm not sure who did it first. The only thing I can say is that I've been to Sweet Flour twice, and both times it was a pretty good experience from start to finish. However, although the cookie does come out hot, fresh, and made to order, it did cost almost 8 bucks for two of them and a glass of milk. Seems a little steep to me, but as a treat, it's nearly perfect.

Living in the Junction and relying on transit can make for a lack of choices when it comes to food, particularly stuff that's considered artisanal. While that may have been true a few years ago, boy-oh-boy, the times are changing. Those of us living in the neighbourhood awhile have seen its dynamic (albeit slow) change, particularly when it comes to food; but in the Junction's ever-expanding food landscape, a few places are setting the stage. Enter the Junction Fromagerie.

Junction Fromagerie is sitting non-coincidentally right next to Delight, a chocolate shop that's perhaps known in the neighbourhood more for their ice cream than their handmade chocolate. Both Delight and Junction Fromagerie are brain-childs of the same people, Jennifer Rashleigh & Jeff Brown, and the association is obvious as far as quality goes. While Delight doesn't have any cheese, they do have a uniquely flavoured and way-better-than-it-sounds Quebec blue cheese ice cream. Soft and creamy with an exacting amount of high-quality blue cheese, it's obviously well crafted and surprisingly tasty.

What makes the Junction Fromagerie different from the handful of other cheese specialty shops in Toronto is their strict direction to Canadian products; they only carry Canadian cheeses, local and artisanal mind you, but Canadian nonetheless. They're also particularly partial to Ontario cheeses. Their in-house made butter, crackers, and croustinis, in conjunction with those small-batch and locally sourced cheeses, make them a worthy underdog in an increasingly competitive business.

The Junction Fromagerie brings with it some old-world charm, and at first walk-in, you may mistake it for a boutique fromage on a quiet Paris street. Big-frame bay window and a creaky wood-laid floor set the space. Besides that, the whole store is fairly nondescript other than the front case brightly displaying their cheeses.

Don't know your Comtomme from your Bleu de la Moutonndere? No worries! Not only is the staff knowledgeable and the cheese labeled and explained, but the Junction Fromagerie also offers cheese tastings and pairings that not only teach you about the cheese they carry, but also inspire you to be a bit more adventurous in your cheese selections. Although these tastings aren't a regularly occurring event, they do happen. Their Stone's Throw Cheese and WIne Pairing event, which was created with the folks at Stone's Throw Winery, sold out super quick.

The appearance of Junction Fromagerie signals more than just beautiful cheese being available in the Junction. It also serves as an important reminder that when it comes to food, the Junction is fast becoming a neighbourhood that is known for quality.

I am not one who is opposed to going out and dining alone, but this is one place where you definitely want to bring a friend along. Offering a tapas-style menu full of Spanish dishes, with a hint of Latin American flare, Torito (Spanish for "little bull") gives you the opportunity to sample a variety of dishes and flavours, and provides a great atmosphere for sharing with friends.

Torito's dining room is quite small, but has a great look and feel. Spanish pop culture images tastefully adorn the back wall and it has an intimate atmosphere and décor modeled after a traditional Barcelona Tapas bar - having never been, I will have to take their word on that.

At first glance, two things stood out about the menu; they had so many options for beverages that the wine and drinks section made up for half of their selection (no complaints here), and I did not know what most of the items were - Patatas Whatas?. Thankfully, the knowledgeable staff were more than happy to explain the menu to me.

Always an advocate for ordering the specials, I began with the Picos and Jamon, thin prosciutto-like ham wrapped around crispy breadsticks, and the Huevos Escoceses, boiled quail eggs battered and fried - quite good!  Following that were the Crab Croquettes and, with the server's recommendation, the Patatas Bravas and Chorizo, or potatoes and spicy sausage.  The Crab Croquettes were perhaps a bit soft for my liking as I do enjoy a bit of crunch, but they were seasoned and plated nicely.  The Patatas Bravas were my kind of "meat n' potatoes" - simply delicious!

The food is flavourful, fresh and clean, and is not hidden behind a barrage of spices and sauces.  Most importantly, it is served in a timely manner.  Torito offers hot and cold tapas, and instead of everything coming out at once to litter the table, it is brought out in a staggered sequence; the cold remain cold, and hot remain hot.

On my next visit--and I will make my way back--I am definitely ordering the Ceviche.  When it arrived to my neighbouring table, it looked fantastic!  If I can recommend something I did not actually taste, it would be that.  If you have tried it, please comment and let me know the verdict!

A few cautionary items to draw your attention to: the restaurant is open only from 5:00p.m. - 11:00p.m., so it is not a late-night-bite place; there is an 18% gratuity (before tax) applied to parties of six or more (not unusual, but watch out for it); and Torito's spread is not for bargain eaters.  For my party of two, with only one single-serving alcoholic drink each, and a dinner of 4 appetizer-sized plates, it was just over $65 before tip.  That said, there is a difference between dining and eating; and Torito is a dining experience that I am happy I had.

Torito is a "little bull" of a restaurant that packs a punch!

Margarita's Fiesta sounds like it should be a delightful, authentic, and fun Mexican dining experience. I had extremely high hopes for this restaurant. As a self-professed Mexican food addict, I could not wait to try this place out. But unfortunately, Margarita's Fiesta was no party at all.

Friday night on Baldwin Street is a lively place with an excess of restaurants, all of them boasting lots of patios, people, music, and conversation; Margarita's is no exception. They have a cozy patio out front, a larger patio on the roof, and tons of colourful umbrellas and luscious plant life. Add in the sounds of the Gypsy Kings, and it's enough to lure anyone in.

The restaurant is quaint and decorated with traditional Mexican and Peruvian artwork, and the restrooms are an art gallery in and of themselves, a fitting homage to Mexico's own Frida Kahlo and her incredible self-portraits. Sounds fun! I know! But that was where the fun stopped...

When we arrived, we were greeted with a grunt, and then pointed to a table on the lower patio. When we asked if we could be seated upstairs, we were told it was closed, only to see guests seated upstairs within the hour. Not a great first impression...

It took a solid 15 minutes before we saw anyone willing to accept our drink order of a pitcher of sangria ($24), which arrived with more ice than wine, a few apple slices, and little flavour. Ever the optimists though, we decided to overlook those and a few small details, and we were anxious to try the food.

We decided to start with their 'famous' nacho chips and guacamole, which arrived only minutes after ordering. The quick arrival slightly redeemed the long wait for cold drinks on a hot Friday night, but the fact that plates, or even napkins, were almost impossible to come by brought us back. Apparently, according to our server, cutlery is reserved for the special people that order entrees.

Almost a half hour later, we were finally allowed to order our mains, after numerous sidelong glances and polite 'excuse mes' to our server. Between the three of us we ordered the Chicken Taco Salad ($12), Chicken Quesadillas ($11) and Vegetarian Enchiladas ($14), each with a side of salad and/or rice. When our meals finally arrived, they were much smaller than I expected, especially for a Mexican restaurant, which is normally known for their large portions size and abundance of extras like salsa, cilantro, sour cream, hot sauce; none of which found their way to our table.

Our meals were okay, but certainly not noteworthy. The taco salad was crispy and fresh, but lacked the colourful palette of ingredients normally found on a taco salad and was overall, a little bland. The quesadilla was small-one tortilla cut in half-with a meagre side salad and no additional toppings to speak of. The enchilada was a decent sized portion, but swam in so much grease and oil, it was difficult to find the substance of the actual meal, whihc was supposedly green peppers, onions and cheese. Overall, we were really quite disappointed with our drinks and our meal. On top of the unfriendly and snail-like service, I was very underwhelmed by my experience at Margarita's Fiesta.

If you are looking for a fun, friendly and rewarding Mexican dining experience, be sure to try out Ahora on Dalhousie Street the next time you find yourself in our nation's Capital, which is Ottawa by-the-way;) Until then, I will be on the lookout for a Toronto Mexican restaurant that lives up to what a Mexican restaurant should be.

On a recent, cold winter's Wednesday, I had the opportunity to have dinner at Caplansky's Delicatessen on College Street. Having heard a number of things about Zane Caplansky's mission to re-invigorate, or at least continue the waning culture of the deli, I was intrigued.

The first thing I noticed, besides the tiny vestibule, is the number of framed magazine covers and articles adorning the walls. It is obvious that this place has captured the attention of many reviewers, both far and wide.

The decor is pure deli. Open all the way back to the meat counter, with requisite white-hatted carver, it is a mixture of banquettes and bare wooden chairs. The walls are covered with kitschy pressed signs advertising everything from chopped liver to catering. Clearly, a lot of work went into making this place feel authentic; like it had been here for 80 years.

Our server was quick to get our drink order and explain the daily soup and what the kitchen was out off. He was back, eager to help, a couple of times before our decisions were made.

Within moments, he was back with our soup order. The borscht was hearty and thick with shredded cabbage and chunks of meat. It was slightly sweet and full of flavour, with just a hint of tomato. Possibly one of the best borscht's I have had in Toronto. My guest's turkey soup, which happened to be the daily soup special, was interesting to say the least. Everything in the bowl, turkey and vegetables, was shredded very finely. It had a hint of smoke, which left us wondering if they were using yesterday's house smoked turkey breast. It was quite tasty, but completely unexpected.

With our soups almost done, our server returned with sides of smoked meat poutine. As a second course, it was the perfect size for two to share. The fries were crisp and cooked well. The gravy was more of a ragout of smoked meat and onions, seasoned thoroughly. The only complaint to be had was the small amount of curds.

With all our bowls cleared away, the mains soon arrived. I opted for a smoked meat sandwich. It arrived with a pickle spear and a small cup of oil and vinegar coleslaw. The meat was moist and well smoked. The fattiness was exactly as I ordered. The sandwich came unadorned with mustard, which was nice as four styles were provided for you to choose. The coleslaw was sweet with a little tang, neither overly vinegary nor oily.

On the other side of the table, grilled kebabs were ordered. The lamb was cooked perfectly, tender and a beautiful medium rare, with a nice crust, which pleasantly tasted of charcoal. Served with a grilled vegetable medley and side salad, it was quite a large portion. Care should be given, as the kitchen uses metal skewers, which, without warning from the server, turned out to be very hot to touch.

All in all, it was quite a good meal. Everything the kitchen put forth was prepared with pride. The only real issue was the desserts: a mixed berry crumble and a chocolate bread pudding. Both were incredibly sweet and had their issues with technique. Unfinished, however, the server asked what we thought and immediately offered to find something more appealing when we told him our thoughts. Kudos to the good service.

Caplansky's Delicatessen lived up to the promise. The food is very well prepared and delicious. Coupled with the easy-going, friendly service, I can see myself going back there time and again.

Cool Hand of a Girl offers simple and healthy food made with organic products, which has become what you'd expect from a place in the Junction as of late. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate how great I feel after a wholesome meal made with locally-sourced, pesticide-free food, but to me, one of the most important things that a restaurant can and should do is make their guests feel welcome. That's where Cool Hand loses points. Maybe it's all part of the appeal for the artsy crowd you can expect to see, but Cool Hand can make you feel as if you're an annoyance to them just for being there. So although I did enjoy my Chicken Tarragon sandwich, I just can't see myself getting back there anytime soon, and somehow, I dont think they'll care.

- If you haven't eaten at The Lakeview, I'd suggest you do.It's quickly become one of my favorite places to go when I'm craving diner food, but want to stay away from the typical greasy spoon diner type-of-place. The Lakeview is open 24 hours-a-day, and that definitely contributes to one of the cool aspects of this place: it isn't that you can eat imaginative diner-esque food at 3 o'clock in the morning on a Tuesday, but also thatyou can eat it at 3 o'clock in the afternoon on aSunday and the experience is entirely different.
That's because it's inconsistent, but not in a bad way. It's inconsistent because of the diverse group of peeps you can expect to see there when you go: Sunday afternoon is the brunch crowd, Saturday evening is the daters, Friday late-night is the Ossignton bar crowd. Whenever you go, it's a different sorta experience.
It's not just diversity that makes this a kick-ass experience, the food is also spectacular and truly imaginative. The style of upscale-diner definitely comes through on their menu withitems like theCorriander Walnut Pesto Omelette, a Peameal Brie and Havarti Cristo-style sandwich, and the Lakeface Albacore Tuna Melt. It's a genuinely nice blend of the expected and the unexpected. As a side note, I need to mention the impressive veggie burger they've got that's made from black beans and served with a wild mushroom saute and caramelized onions. Spectacular. Whether it's their 24-hour menu or their brunch menu, vegetarian or carnivore items, this place cranks out some delicious food.
I'd definitely recommend you check out The Lakeview. They're doing diner food right, 24 hours-a-day.

Here is the best advice I can provide if you're thinking about heading to Khao San Road:

1. Make reservations. Since it opened, this place has gotten great buzz for providing authentic, flavourful Thai food. As a result, people from all over the city have been flocking to this casual downtown joint for lunch and dinner. (They also do take out orders.) My friend and I arrived at 6pm on a Thursday and the place was already almost full: tables of two and four, plus the larger tables at the front that could be utilized for larger parties or cafeteria-style seating and the bar were occupied by a mix of couples, friends and colleagues from the surrounding businesses. While we waited to be seated, I noticed a sheet of laminated paper at the host's stand imploring potential, hungry customers to be patient while waiting for a table to become available.

2. Come hungry. Portions are more than reasonable and priced accordingly. We were starving and decided to try a number of dishes and split them between us: cold rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves and Thai basil (Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw); crispy squash fritters (Gra Bong); a curry dish with bell and hot peppers, kaffir lime leaves and the ubiquitous Thai basil (Gaeng Panang); pad Thai; and a house specialty of stir-fried minced beef with holy basil, topped with a fried egg (Pad Gra Pra). We also ordered the only beer available, Singha. Not entirely sure why there is only one, but it's a light, refreshing beer and I had no complaints about it.

3. Temper your expectations. The food at Khao San Road is good, yes,but it was not exemplary. It wasn't bad by any means, but I had very high expectations that were sadly unmet. The exception was the Pad Gra Pra which was very, very good. It's a house specialty so if you go, you might be best to stick with the items on that particular part of the menu. There was nothing wrong with the food in particular; however, after hearing such glowing reviews from both friends and reviews, I was anticipating more.

Additionally, we found the service lacking. Our order was taken promptly and our first round of drinks appeared in short order. The problems started when food began to arrive at our fairly small table faster than we could eat. I pointed this out to our server who shrugged and kept piling on the plates. Once we had all our food, our server disappeared, a problem on two fronts: we had no room to maneuver and we wanted another round of Singhas. We were able to flag her down eventually and we were served with much reluctance from that point.

Khao San Road is not a bad restaurant by any stretch. The food is better than average but not spectacular. Stick with the house specialties and you'll likely do well. If you're going to go in for a sit-down meal, reservations are a must. Better yet, call ahead for take-out and have a couple of beers ready to go at home.

My chicken lived a healthy, happy life. She was lovingly cared for, allowed to roam the yard, and fed fresh corn and barley. How do I know? The other day I was going to my neighbourhood grocery store to buy a whole chicken. You know the type of bird I mean. It sits in those refrigerated, glass boxes at the back of the store; the only indication it was ever a chicken at all is the familiar sight of wings and breast meat. As its lifeless body sits there, I can't ever imagine this thing having feathers, breathing, living. Truth be told, buying that chicken is a mostly unceremonious experience that people rarely give a second thought to.

But something spectacular happened to me that day. I didn't buy that chicken; I didn't even get to the grocery store. On my way there, I noticed the Butcher by Nature storefront, and I felt compelled to check it out and see what all this 'By Nature' business was all about.

Butcher by Nature gives life to that lifeless chicken. Much like purchasing pedigree, the butcher and owner, Frank, knew all about my chicken and all the other chickens he was selling for that matter. He knew the farmers personally, and he knew that they were passionate about raising animals. He spoke proudly about the pesticide-free and natural-focused environment the farmers raised their livestock in. Clearly, this is a different kind of eating.

The shop is fairly small, but truly cozy, and the store is classic with more butchery area than retail shop. The retail area has shelves lined with locally-sourced dry products, like jams and honey, and fridges lined with locally-sourced meat products, like duck and eggs. Butcher by Nature also has a passionate, knowledgeable owner. Actually, forget that last bit; calling Frank knowledgeable is an understatement. The art and science of butchery is seemingly ingrained in his bones. Much like those chicken's proud lineage, Frank was raised to do butchery.

Pesticide-free, hormone-void, locally-sourced meats, combined with an experienced owner and a pleasant store-front is what Butcher by Nature is all about. And of course, they're not limited to just chickens. They carry quite a large variety of meat including duck, venison, pork, and beef; all of it butchered and prepared in a bunch of different ways.
Fear not. Eating all this organic natural stuff isn't for just the rich. In fact, most of the products at Butcher by Nature are actually reasonably priced. In most cases, you can expect to pay just a few bucks more than you would at the neighbourhood grocery store. That, combined with the absolute passion surrounding what they carry makes it an easy choice for meat. Even if you're not in the area, Butcher by Nature is worth the trip.

So, if you think that chickens, or most other animals for that matter, magically end up in refrigerated, glass boxes at the back of a grocery store, then you owe it to yourself to check out Butcher by Nature because when it comes to meat, it's all about where it comes from.

Offering up "snacks and libation" from 5pm to 2am, Monday to Saturday, this brand new spot just north of Queen proves to be a great and funky stop to grab a little bite. 

There are three reasons why this new restaurant appealed to me... 

First, the atmosphere is very cool and casual - there really is no theme or décor; it almost looks as though they opened before they were done decorating, but in a charming way that allows it to become almost homelike in its honesty. Even the menu is printed on a piece of lined paper that remains set on the table on a (mini-sized) clipboard.

Second, someone here has tapped into that great ordeal; you have already eaten dinner, but the energy spent on socializing has left you feeling a bit ravenous. The problem is that you don't want to go out for a whole second meal. The answer: Snack Bar. The small, inexpensive portions are a perfect pairing with after work drinks (you won't ruin your dinner appetite) or a nightcap (you won't stuff yourself to the point of uncomfortable).  

Third, they understand that "snack" to food-lovers means more than grabbing a granola bar or settling for a muffin for satisfaction.  They have nibble-sized some of your favourite late-night snacks, including a grilled hot dog, pork belly on a bun, Jamaican beef patties and pizza pockets at an appetizing price-point of $3 - $6. There are a few other items, like oysters (coming in at $6 - $7) and latkes with gravlax, to give the menu some oomph.

I started with the pork belly on a bun, one of items I saw featured on their website - a delicious crispy pork morsel tucked inside a steamed bun, filled with Asian-inspired flavours (like Hoisin and chili sauces) and some leaves of arugula, making a wonderfully balanced salty treat. 

Then, I rounded things off with a grown-up version of the nostalgia-inducing pizza pocket. This is really more likened to a mini-mini-calzone; it's crispy and airy, stuffed with cheese and laid upon a bed of rustic tomato sauce. After the super flavourful pork belly bun this almost seemed bland, but it was perfectly cheesy and the crunch was on-point. My dining partner caved in and got the hot dog - it was smaller than expected, but hit the spot - followed by the Jamaican beef patty. Both were good, but the bun and pocket are a more interesting choice at the Snack Bar. 

The drinks menu is very scant, but I won't sneer at a cold beer. Overall, I think 416 Snack Bar is on its way to being one of those great spots in the city. I'm going to keep my eye on this one - it's something new and unique and, I use the word again, honest. This could prove to be a new favourite for many a food-loving Torontonian.

Crepes aren't just for dessert folks.  That's what Dewey Truong, owner of Chococrepe wants you to know.  Yes, they are paper thin, but they aren't as one dimensional when it comes to their meal potential.  Walking into the Queen West restaurant on a hot summer day, the last thing that I wanted to eat for lunch was a Nutella and chocolate smeared crepe, so it's a good thing there was so much more on the menu.
 
Don't let the name fool you.  At Chococrepe, the menu is divided into savoury and sweet options.  So yes, they do offer the obligatory Nutella crepe along with a slew of other sinfully sweet creations, but they also have an impressive selection of crepes with fillings usually associated with sandwiches or wraps.

To start off we had the Pesto ($9.25) which came with egg, mozzarella , pesto and arugula served on a buckwheat crepe.  Now I'm not an eggs anytime of the day person as I lump them into the breakfast only category, so this probably wouldn't be my go to crepe, but it was tasty nevertheless.  The egg was fluffy, the pesto made its presence known without stealing the show, and arugula is never a bad idea. 

All of the savoury menu items come served on buckwheat crepes which are a bit similar to whole wheat wraps in their texture and consistency.  Despite the name though, it's interesting to note that buckwheat is gluten free, so while I can't speak for the filling, the crepe itself is a good option for those who are at least sensitive to gluten.

To round out our savoury options we tried the Country and the Chipotle Chicken (both $9.25).  The Country comes stuffed with cheddar and punctuated with wood-smoked bacon and caramelized pear.  I'm not even a huge fan of bacon (I know...sorry) but I loved this crepe.  The saltiness of the cheddar, the smokiness of the bacon and the sweetness of the pear blended so nicely into a ménage a trois of flavour. (What?  It's French...like crepes...)

The Chipotle Chicken though, with a generous amount of tender chicken breast, mozzarella, arugula, and chipotle mayo, might have been the winner, but I like anything that comes served with a side of heat.

At this point it's fair to say we were beyond full, and I was convinced that yes, crepes could be lunch, but it wouldn't be fair of us to ignore the dessert crepes completely.  So we tried two.  The Berry Banana ($8.75) is the Platonic ideal of a dessert crepe.  Covered with sliced strawberries and bananas, then drizzled with dark and white chocolate, it looks like art (think Jackson Pollock).  This crepe had a nice balance of tart, thanks to the strawberries, and sweet, thanks to everything else. 

Our last crepe of the day came in the form of Crunchy Pear ($8.50), also beautiful in design with sliced Bosch pears, a generous sprinkling of crushed almonds, and painted with milk chocolate, it was a bit sweeter than the Berry Banana due in part to the milk chocolate, but won in the texture category.

All of the dessert crepes here are made with the typical sweetened wheat flour and served open-face which gives diners the artistic license to fold, roll, or just dive in as is.  And it just looks prettier.

Oh, and I should mention that all of the crepes are huge, taking up plates that are larger than your average plate.  My suggestion is to bring a friend, or two, and sample multiple crepes like we did.

Did I forget to mention the hot chocolate?  Oh yes, we sampled a couple.  They take their hot chocolate seriously here at Chococrepe.  All flavours are made with melted Valhrona chocolate and you can have your choice of having it made with dark or milk chocolate (and in some cases, white) and with cream or milk. We really wanted to try the popular Fleur de Sel Dulce de Leche made with dark chocolate, but sadly it was unavailable, so we went with the Pumpkin and the Coconut.  The Pumpkin ($5.95) was made with milk chocolate, so as not to overpower the spice and milk instead of its heavier counterpart.  It was tasty, but I would liken it more to a chai latte than a hot chocolate.
The Coconut (also $5.95) however, made with white chocolate and cream was something else.  It was rich without being cloyingly sweet and the coconut flavour came through nicely.  I can definitely see myself going back for one of these once the temperature starts to drop, but if you're craving one now, Truong just installed a brand new air-conditioning system that he's very proud of. 

I would also be remiss not to comment on the excellent service at Chococrepe.  Truong himself is a living doll, and he goes out of his way to make your experience at Chococrepe a memorable one.  He obviously loves what he is doing, and says that he wants eating at his restaurant to be a comfortable and social experience, not to mention a delicious one.  Check, check, and check.

Footnote:  Why doesn't the saying go "as flat as a crepe"?  Let's face it, in comparison, the crepes pancake cousin from the West has a bit of a weight problem.

With a secluded feeling and an amazing view of the Toronto skyline, Pauper's Pub arguably has one of the best patios in Toronto. The wings are slightly charred and saucy, and they have a pretty decent draft selection. While the second floor lounge is a cozy space, the first floor could use a reno because with its handmade 60's fabric lampshades and dull brass railings, it definitley doesn't hide it's age well.

Let me start by saying I am truly a Latin American food snob. I am fortunate enough to know what the good stuff - the real stuff - tastes like, and I resent those who do it poorly. It's not difficult food to make, but it takes both time and love to create great Latin American dishes, and it frustrates me when I see melted cheese from a jar smeared on store-bought chips that are passed off as "Mexican food" in restaurants. So it was a relief and a thrill to hear that the head chef from The Black Hoof was helming Grand Electric and promised, "Mexican food, craft beer, brown liquor and loud music."

I met my dinner companion across the street at The Mascot at 5:45 and watched as a line started to form outside Grand Electric. The baristas suggested we get ourselves over there before the line up got too long, warning us we'd be eating at 9pm if we didn't get it in gear. We dutifully lined up at 5:50pm behind two parties. Within five minutes the line had extended half a block behind us. At 6:02pm, the doors opened and people flooded inside. We were shown to a table for two and marveled at just how quickly the small space filled up. Tables were gone by 6:05 and the bar was full a minute later. Music blared, servers started making their rounds and Grand Electric was off and running.

The bar is quite the thing to behold. Bourbon-heavy, it is run by enthusiastic and well-informed staff.  It towers over patrons and is a great focal point for the restaurant. In addition to bourbon, you can try several craft beers including Churchkey and Canucklehead cask ale. Both are excellent, but if you haven't tried a cask ale, you should know it's not carbonated. Don't let that dissuade you from checking it out, though, as it has a fruity and slightly bitter taste. You'll be hooked after your first taste.

The menu for Grand Electric located at the back of the restaurant on a giant chalkboard. It is split up into appetizers, tacos, specials and dessert. Given the advanced buzz that's been generated, we opted to try as many dishes as possible. We had the guacamole and nachos (an excellent test of a Mexican restaurant's mettle), tuna ceviche, chicken frito appetizers, one of each taco, and in the end, we went for the key lime pie for dessert.

Beers in hand, we eagerly awaited our food which came out surprisingly fast considering the kitchen must have gotten just crushed with all of us arriving at once. First up came the guacamole and chips. The dip was generously salted and had lots of lime juice, essential elements both. Without enough of those two simple ingredients, guacamole falls flat, but this was the best restaurant-made I've ever had (oh, and it comes with a huge serving of light-as-air pork chicharron as a garnish; a great aesthetic touch as it towers over the guacamole & chips). The fresh corn tortilla chips were also both well seasoned and delicious.

A plate of three tacos was delivered to us, and we hung on every word our server said as she explained which taco was which. The first three were the sweet pork belly al pastor with pineapple, the fried queso (cheese) and spicy arbol chicken. It's not that spicy, I promise, especially considering some of the other choices. Of these, the only miss was the queso which I thought could have benefited from some salt. Having said that, the other two were simply wonderful, especially the pork belly.  We also tried the Baja fish taco, a lightly breaded tilapia fillet topped with bright, fresh cabbage. The textures of the soft tortilla and the crunchy, crispy toppings had us grinning from ear to ear.

Not-to-be-forgotten is the chicken frito dish we ordered: a mound of crispy, fried chicken pieces slathered in a sweet and citrus-y coating and sprinkled with healthy doses of cilantro, jalapeno peppers slices and little, red, evil chile peppers. I like heat, but skipped over the red chiles in favor of the jalapenos. Sweet, sour, spicy, juicy, crispy, hot...there was nothing about this dish that should be changed. Ever. I will most definitely be ordering this one again.

Overall, this was one of the most fun and delicious meals I've had in Toronto. The atmosphere is supercharged in the restaurant, filled with happy customers taking pictures of and devouring the food coming out of the kitchen. While you can hardly say that each dish on the menu is truly, authentically Mexican, it hardly matters when it's this good. A word to the wise: go early or you will be waiting for hours for a seat, but even if you do end up waiting, it'll be worth it. There is no other place in the city putting out food like this.

Coffee Tree has some seriously outstanding coffee. I guess they should. They tout themselves as being Toronto's first onsite roastery--since 1988. Despite all that time, it's not a colossal roasting operation. In fact, it's a small machine in the front window of the shop, but that's part of the appeal of this place: fair-trade coffee roasted onsite, in small batches, right in front of your eyes.

As it becomes available, Coffee Tree scrawls all of their different roasts and blends of contrasting kinds of beans on a chalkboard near the front entrance. Some of these blends and roasts change from time-to-time; others are Coffee Tree's signatures. On any given day, you can expect to find Casa Primi, Sensuous Morning, Tuscany, and Millionaire's Mixture; some of their well-known signatures. Other days, you can find blends that have been created exclusively for the week or month.

Regardless of what you choose, this coffee is superb, roasted perfectly, and balanced. Sip it slowly, and you'll definitely find complexity. There's the perfect blend of sweet and savoury and none of the unpleasant bitterness you'd expect from other coffee shop brews.

But it ain't all coffee at Coffee Tree. They've got a surprisingly detailed food menu, considering it's a coffee joint. From breakfast, lunch, and dinner, to French toast, sandwiches, and empanadas, they've got something for whatever time of day you go. They've also got a chilled dessert fridge featuring in-house made desserts, which includes what they call--and I'm inclined to agree--the World's Best Carrot cake. If you're there, give it an unregrettable try.

The shop layout is the typical long narrow space of most Toronto street-level businesses, and unfortunately, their furniture and decorating ideas aren't much of a help. Despite having unforgettable coffee, the space makes the experience of drinking it feel closed off.  They do, however, support local art by featuring a local artist's work on their walls for sale, and that certainly is a plus, but when I was there, the art wasn't something I was particularly captivated by; but I'm told it changes. All this place really needs a little reno, and it would be near perfect, or at least get 5 stars in my review.

Despite the poor decor choice, they still roast some brilliant coffee. Even if you're not in the neighbourhood, it's worth the trip.

We visited Brassaii during Summerlicious this year and their selections were fabulous. Prior to ordering our meals, we focused our attention on their specialty cocktail list which featured several special mixed drinks and Caesars. I wish we could have tried them all. Instead, I settled for a tasty Gin Caesar topped off with a slice of cucumber and a grape tomato; while my date enjoyed a Balsamic Bramble: a sweet mixture of gin, chambord, and champagne crested with some fresh fragrant berries.

Chowing down for dinner after taking the edge off; I ordered a sweet flavoured vichyssoise topped with a chive creme fraiche as my appetizer; sirloin steak frites served perfectly to my liking with a sensational chimichurri sauce that sent a wave of excitement through my taste buds accompanied by perfectly seasoned Yukon fries; and although I normally pass on dessert; I, thankfully, let the temptation of their dark chocolate raspberry delice overtake my sanity to perfectly cap off my dining experience.

My date enjoyed two crab cakes served with curry aioli and mango salsa as her appetizer which looked very tasty, and I suspect they were SO tasty, and that that was probably the reason I wasn't even afforded a nibble. Her entree was a filet of baked salmon seared to pink perfection, with a pureed mash of wasabi potato and fennel, presented elegantly next to a julienned citrus salad; and, as her sweet tooth is always stimulated, this time she enjoyed an almond butter cake topped with freshly sliced strawberries and a Brassaii specialty their home-made basil ice cream.

All in all, I definitely would'nt hesitate to recommend Brassaii. It's a true neighbourhood gem that isn't as hard to find; it's located just 100 metres west of Spadina Avenue on the south side of King Street West.

What makes for a great neighbourhood restaurant? There are certain essential qualities that it must have: a friendly, knowledgeable staff, a charming host, great atmosphere and above all, fantastic food. Tabülé is unquestionably one of these restaurants. Serving amazing Middle Eastern cuisine, Tabülé is a midtown spot not to be missed.

Tabülé offers fresh, intensely flavoured dishes from start to finish. Over several visits, I have had the pleasure of trying about half the menu and have yet to come across a dish that wasn't utterly delectable. Normally not a big fan of eggplant, I make exceptions here for the babaganüj, a gorgeous pureéd eggplant dip mixed with tahini, garlic and lemon juice. Additionally, the fried eggplant has great char on it and is finished with a lemon & garlic dressing that adds a bright note to the soft, creamy, rich starter. Not to be overlooked are the fresh, pungent tabülé and the labni which is a yogurt cheese mixed with a healthy dose of garlic and topped with zaatar. Finally, the hot cauliflower appetizer was recommended by the host who did not steer us in the wrong direction. Finished with Lebanese tahini, there were polite fights over who would get the last morsel.

Once you have gorged yourself on the hot and cold mezze (starters), it is time to move on the main event. There is always a fresh fish of the day, topped with the bright house lemon and garlic dressing. The grilled mains all come with heaping portions of rice with crispy onions for texture as well as grilled peppers, onions and zucchini. The kefta is certainly a popular option and a tasty one at that. Consider them Lebanese meatballs, made with a mix of ground lamb and beef, tomatoes, onions, parsley, garlic and lemon juice. Always perfectly cooked, they are steaming hot upon arrival at the table, a little bit pink inside. Also fabulous is the charcoal-broiled shrimp that have been marinated in Middle Eastern spices. Spicy and succulent, they are even slightly better with the squeeze of lemon that accompanies this particular dish. You will not want to share them with your dining companions.

While you are thoroughly enjoying your food, take some time to look around and drink in the atmosphere. The restaurant itself is cozy without feeling claustrophobic and the dining room is host to just about every demographic in Toronto. You will see couples on dates, families, birthday celebrations, even bachelorette parties. On Saturday night, people wait patiently at the bar for a table and are entertained by the belly dancing show at 9pm. Though a little calmer during lunch, Tabülé certainly does not lack atmosphere. Upon return visits, you will notice that you see the same wait staff over and over again - a good sign in a turbulent industry. Hospitality is the name of the game here, and it is done expertly.

Should you have room for dessert (and if you don't, just loosen your belt a little. It's worth it), check out the künafa ashta. Lebanese custard is topped with super fine shreds of phyllo pastry, pistachios and rose water syrup. Light and not overly sweet, this dish is a superb way to end a meal and is a paradigm of why Tabülé's menu is so successful: it combines many elements in a balanced, seamless dish. It is at once creamy, crunchy, a bit tart, a bit sweet and is highly aromatic.

Like the final course of the evening, all the dishes at Tabülé balance flavor and texture and, because of this, the food is elevated beyond the ingredients. Pop in for a meal, or have one delivered to you: either way, you enjoy a hearty, mouth-watering meal that will have you coming back for more.

About a year ago, Bloor and Lansdowne saw the closing of its neighbourhood institution: The Dale. The Dale had been serving 'greasy spoon' diner food in the neighbourhood for nearly 60 years, but what emerged from behind the brown paper and dressing screens of a renovation was so much better.

The Bloordale Pantry, opened by young couple Rose and Anthony, has moved this venue from institution to gem. A lot of love went into this place; and not only love for their little diner, but also love for the neighbourhood in which it sits.

Upon entering, the greeting was warm and friendly, which wouldn't be strange as my guest and I have eaten there a couple of times, but you don't need to be a regular to feel at home; every one of their guests seems to be rewarded with a warm smile and happy hello.

The room is decorated with local art mixed with diner kitsch. It's all brought together by red vinyl booths lining one wall, and an old dinerstyle counter and stools lining the other.

The menu's main theme is diner food with an all day breakfast and lots of sandwiches, but it's all updated regularly and prepared well. It also features a lot of Italian fare with both a panini and pasta section.

On a recent visit, my guest tried the 'Mac'n'Cheese', which she thought was cheesy and good, albeit needing a little more flavour. My Bloordale Brisket sandwich was sloppy and well cooked--as it should be! The brisket meat was tender, but not falling apart. The barbeque sauce was a little sweeter than I generally like, but overall the sandwich was filling and comforting just like diner food is supposed to be. Served with their expertly seasoned and perfectly crisp French fries and creamy coleslaw, it was quite a large portion.

Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and with a menu that has vegetarian options and interesting daily specials, like meatloaf, 'Jalapeno Popper' burger or house cured trout, The Bloordale Pantry pretty much offers something for everyone.

- It wasn't that long ago that Bloordale was a strip of Toronto that felt neglected. In fact, most people may feel like its still neglected, but looking around, it's evident that there are signs of improvement. That's where Three Speed comes in. Located unseemingly near Pauline on Bloor street West, they definitely took a risk opening up in this somewhat seedy Toronto neighbourhood. But regardless the risk, it seems to have worked for them. Packed nightly with 20-something hipsters, it's difficult to get a seat if you show up past 8 or 9 o'clock, but don't let any of that stop you. As far as 'Blansdowne' goes, bar-wise there just isn't much that competes with it. 

Three Speed is brought about by the same people that started the Communist's Daughter, and they also have some affiliation with The Dakota, so you can expect the same sorta crowd and atmosphere--and dare I say pretentiousness--that you'd expect to see in any of those spots. If you can find the dam place that is...

Three Speed is difficult to notice. In fact, if you weren't directly looking for it or didn't know where it was, you'd probably go right past; and if it wasn't for the red lights strung about the front window spiking my curiousity, I probably wouldn't have ever discovered it either. So when you're walking around Bloor and Lansdowne, and you finally do find it and get inside, the hidden-factor sorta gives the feel of a Bloordale oasis.

The inside of Three Speed is not what you'd expect by the near-crumbling exterior. Inside it's dimly lit, low-key, and seriously comfortable. With exposed brick, wood panels, and art galore, it's an easy place to want to hang out at.

Scribbled on a chalkboard and suspended on the bar wall, Three Speed has a slightly random food menu that displays their feature items, like mussels served in 1 of 3 styles,  Lo, Med, and High, indicating 'speed' but not content. You can expect well-rounded flavours of lime, fennel, and roasted garlic. No mistake, these are mighty good mussels.  But if there's a bunch of you, and mollusks aren't your thing, I'd recommend the Party Plate. It's a nice spread of cheese, meat, and pickled goodness. If you're not the sharing type, I'd go with the sirloin burger. Although I've definitely had better, this is still a savoury and sizeable burger that won't disappoint you.

Like I said, it feels like the neighbourhood is on the mend and slowly losing its feel of neglect. There are even a few other cool spots that followed suit and opened up in this neighbourhood, like Holy Oak and the Starving Artist; both businesses that are beginning to do well.

If you're in the Bloordale area, hanging out at Three Speed is an easy, but slowly becoming not the only option. But the fact remains, these people have taken a crappy, ex-Karaoke dump in a less-than-desirable neighbourhood and turned it into something special that is directly impacting the culture of Bloordale and for that, they definitely deserve to be commended. Nice job Three Speed.

It's just overpriced, ill-prepared pizza, but because this place holds nostalgic value for a lot of Junction locals, it's often busy. You're better off grabbing a slice on the takeout side of Vesuvio's. A slice is cheaper, and for some reason tastes far superior.

Out on a cold winter's week night, some friends and I thought we'd head to Terroni on Adelaide for a casual bite. Not having a reservation, on what appeared to be a very busy night, the hostess recommended that we try their new venture, La Bettola di Terroni, which was close by.

Once we arrived, we were all immediately impressed by the glass-walled pantry in the entranceway. It is always comforting to find a restaurant that flaunts its freshness. To me, it screams, 'Come in! We know what we are doing!'

We took the advice, and waited for a table in a very cramped entrance way. With three other patrons in front of us, the hostess desk seemed very busy, but soon we were greeted and seated having had a table reserved at the suggestion of the hostess at Terroni.

The first thing we noticed, sitting at the end of a very long shared table, was how loud the music was. A mixture of 60s R&B and 70s Disco; it was far too loud. We actually couldn't even hear each other. Being a trio, I had to use my friend to the left to convey what I was saying to the friend sitting opposite me. At one point, while trying to explain my thoughts on my salad to the person across from me, they smiled, nodded, and asked 'so what salad are you having'? I'll admit the restaurant was packed, bustling, and full of all the noises that come with that, but despite that, the music was the biggest contributor to the noise.

Our server soon appeared and did a great job answering all the questions we threw at him about red and white wines. He spoke well and seemed to truly care about recommending something we'd enjoy. Unfortunately, upon his return he gave the white to the red drinker and vice versa. To his credit, he noticed his own mistake and did not make it again with any of the refills.

Looking at the menu, anyone familiar with Terroni will find a lot to like here. It is, as their website describes, a sort 'best of' all the food at Terroni, with something for everyone.

Bread arrived with olive oil to dip. The oil had a nice earthy bitterness and was quite enjoyable. Our salads arrived soon after: a Giuggiolosa with mixed greens with Cambozola cheese, grilled peppers, pine nuts, black olives, honey and a Barbabietole e Caprino with roasted beets, goat's cheese, lamb's lettuce, pistachios, candied lemon zest, and anchovy balsamic dressing. The Giuggiolosa was slightly too sweet and could have used a few more of Bettola's exceptional olives to add some more saltiness, but the Barbabietole e Caprino was near flawless. The beets were well roasted, and the flavours all stood out, as they should have. 

Looking at the menu, one of my guests fondly remembered having eaten Arancini di Modica on a ferry ride once from Italy to Sicily, so out of nostalgia, we ordered them. Arancini are breaded and deep-fried balls of rice, cheese and other fillings. At La Bettola di Terroni, they're filled with mozzarella and a pork ragout. They were a step above their peasant food origins, but all of us agreed that they weren't spectacular, didn't live up to the nostalgia, and we wouldn't be compelled to order them again.

Our pizzas arrived soon after. Having been to other Terronis before, I knew what to expect, and so we decided to split two pizzas between the three of us. Although thin crusted, they're not small.

We ordered a Smendozzata, with sausage, red onion and gorgonzola on a tomato base, and a C't Mang with prosciutto, pear, walnuts and honey with gorgonzola and mozzarella on an olive oil base. The Smendozzata was classic Terroni style, and just as expected. The Gorgonzola was sharp and salty, and the sausage had a hint of fennel. Tasty. The C't Mang was also excellent, with the perfect combination of salty and sweet, and a nice sharpness from the Gorgonzola.

Overall, it was a good meal. With La Bettola di Terroni, the Terroni family has added another feather in its cap. La Bettola di Terroni serves classic, Italian comfort food and serves it well. Besides the noise level, it's be a great place to take a date, bring the family, or bring friends.

Anyone remember when Future Bakery was big business? It had multiple locations around Toronto, and it was focused heavily on the food and culture of its Ukrainian ownership. While the Annex location is still kicking strong and remains a popular beacon for starving U of T students, the others, except for the tiny St. Lawrence Market outlet and a baking factory in the city's Westend, have all but disappeared. All that remains is a lone, ceramic Ukrainian Easter egg sitting high up on a shelf in the Annex location. But time moves on I suppose, and there's a reason that despite the others all going under, the Annex location is still packed at almost all hours of the day.

Future is cheap. Straight up, that's probably one of the predominant reasons they're so busy, but it's not as if you're getting some reheated crappy food for your money. They make some pretty good stuff. (Right off the bat, I'd like to point out that there is a food outlet right in the back of this place, and I think they sublease it to sell food in there, but I am including it in this review, despite that they might be two different places.) Most notably, you can grab a pretty good breakfast there, especially on a Sunday morning. Sundays in the Annex are deadsville; everything is closed until the early-afternoon, so if you live in the area or you happen to find yourself there because you thought everything would be open, this is a great place to grab a pleasant morning breakfast or a greasy hangover cure.

Future has some seriously amazing cakes, and if that's your thing, then you should know that Future is probably one of the best values for cake in the city. Besides having a killer selection of top quality cakes, they all sell for about 5 bucks a cut. There are a whole ton of different kinds too, ranging from fruit pies and caramel-based cakes to cheesecakes and heavy-chocolate tortes. Although I don't find their coffee particularly spectacular, they do have it available, and it's still a pretty natural choice to go with the cake, despite being nothing-more-than-average.

Once the warmer months hit, Future place has got a pretty spectacular patio too.  Busy, big, and perfect for people watching, it's easily the 2nd best patio spot in the Annex. It covers the whole side of Future's corner building, and it's an ideal place for cold pints.

Future pretty much accommodates everyone. Early morning breakfast, late night after the bar, mid-week meeting spot, in-between-classes study hole; no matter what you're using it for, chances are that Future will be able to offer you something. So despite the fact that the Ukrainian aspect is no longer really existing here--or at least not being a visible existence--it hasn't slowed this place down at all. Most likely, people haven't even noticed the lack of Ukrainianess. And while purely for nostalgic reasons, I find that a bit on the disappointing side, as long as every time I go in there I can be reminded of Future's past by that lone Uki Easter egg, I'll make due, and I'll being eating cake.

Despite all of the new multi-story buildings going up in the area, the Entertainment district is still full of lively, exciting, cool and truly unique places to check out; from the theatres to the restaurants, it is a great area to spend a night or two and explore.  I hesitate to say I "stumbled" upon this particular location as it is quite visible across from the main strip of theatres on this part of King Street, but I did enter on quite the spontaneous whim.

Their contemporary and inviting atmosphere is infused with Motown and Blues décor and music, which sets the mood perfectly for their southern dishes.  They offer up a nicely balanced menu of traditional Cajun-style grub and the more typical Canadian restaurant fare; from fish and fried foods galore, to goat-cheese-adorned salads and honey-garlic chicken, there really is something for everyone.

I popped in early and was greeted with the notice of half-priced appetizers before 8:00 p.m. - a great opportunity to try a couple.  There are plenty of barbecued chicken, rib and steak platters to choose from, but what could be more appropriate than their cornmeal crusted catfish sticks?  I had them with the goat cheese and Cajun-roasted pistachio salad, and it turned out to be a delightful meal.

The catfish sticks are a must. After I ordered, a small plate with one tiny morsel of something arrived in front of me - this was worrisome.  Thankfully, it was just a mini-muffin sized, mildly sweet portion of cornbread (a side note: not enough restaurants give you complimentary bread at the table anymore; it does not have to be an overflowing basket of buns, but just a small bite of something light and delicious starts the meal off right). When the fish did arrive, I was more than impressed with the serving size. They were light and crispy and with smokey-sweet Cajun spice and served a tangy tartar sauce.

The salad had a hint of that same Cajun spice on the pistachios, but was otherwise just as expected for greens, except for one crucial detail - the copious amount of cheese!  Finally, a restaurant after my own dairy-loving heart!  I have too often overpaid for goat-cheese-promising pastas and salads that have fallen short.  Joe Mamas, on the other hand, gave me a meal-size salad, with more than my fair share of cheese, and all at half-price no less!

I eased myself into my first southern cuisine experience with a dinner of appetizers, worried that I might be confronted with an over-spiced and over-fried spread.  Thankfully proven wrong, on my next visit to Joe Mamas, I'll be diving into their menu with less hesitancy.

Real Sports Bar and Grill is an amazing place to go if you are an avid sports fan. Casual viewers need not apply. A bar boasting North America's biggest HD TV screen, and at 39 feet, they are not exaggerating, creates a certain atmosphere, but that may not be what everyone is looking for in a sports bar...let me explain. 

Real Sports is shiny, flashy and new. The place is decked out with 199 other HD TV screens, all vying for your attention, on top of the main attraction. The bar is lit up with translucent coloured panels, creating a space that feels a bit more like a nightclub than a bar and grill. The wait staff all look really good, but it seems to take the entire quarter of a basketball game to get your drink or order a meal.

Real Sports menu is comprehensive and well thought out. They serve 12 different flavours of chicken wings, and a great selection of sandwiches and burgers. I can attest to the quality of both the Grilled Chicken on Swiss Panini and the Grilled Portobello Mushroom Sandwich ($13, $12). Real Sports also serves of a variety of appetizers, hot dogs, poutine, salads and some filling entrees of ribs, salmon and meatloaf. But here is where the fun stops. I have not had good luck with the appetizers at Real Sports, often finding the portion to be smaller than I expected, and the food lacking a certain something. The calamari was a bit dry, and the chipotle mayo has been done. When I ordered the sweet potato fries as an appetizer, the portion of "5 spice aioli" that came on the side could have been consumed within the first two fries. I was not impressed. 

Food issues aside, Real Sports serves up 112 different beers on tap, and a decent selection of wine and whiskey. Expect to pay a steep price, however. With most of the beer prices ranging between $6.25 and $8.50, and wine from $9 up to $23.50 a glass, the "sports" theme of the bar is quickly replaced with the pricing of a mid-range restaurant. I must admit, I have never been able to digest the alcohol prices at Real Sports.

What Real Sports lacks in food and prices, however, it makes up for in location and style. Located walking distance to the Rogers Centre, and across the street from the Air Canada Centre, it is, literally, a 30 second walk to the ACC, giving meaning to the "real" in Real Sports. With more TV's than you could find inside the biggest BestBuy store out there, you will never miss a game or event again. It really feels like Real Sports is actually playing every sporting event in the world, and you can take your pick. 

Real Sports boasts a 90-foot ice bar, which swaggering up to and ordering a drink at feels pretty cool (pun intended). It's a neat gimmick, but also extremely functional, as those sitting at the bar always have a cold drink. I have just never quite figured out where to rest my hands. 
Real Sports is loaded with seating, it always seem that there is a place to sit. With the bar spanning over two levels, all with forward facing booths, there really isn't a bad seat in the house.

If you are looking for a good time, and not extremely concerned with the quality, or price, of your food and beverage, then by all means, head over to Real Sports; I can almost guarantee you will have a good time. Seeing the 39-foot TV for the first time is a fun experience, especially when your team is playing on it. If you go to Real Sports with realistic expectations, you will not be disappointed.

You're downtown, you're headed to a game and you need to grab a bite to eat before you head there. You take stock of your options and think, "These places all look kind of similar - where should I head?" Might I suggest you check out Joe Badali's, an Italian-themed restaurant on Front St. West, steps from both the Rogers Centre and the ACC. The spacious bar/restaurant has something for everyone, a key to success for large groups that often book parties there.

A friend and I popped in the other day to check out their fall/winter brunch menu. Given our choice of bar, table or booth, we opted for a cozy booth in the middle of the restaurant and were given three menus from which to choose our meal. A bit overwhelming, perhaps, but our waiter explained that one menu was strictly for their new pescetarian promotion where you can choose the fish you'd like and how you'd like it cooked. Feeling like it was a little early for ahi tuna, my companion and I went for the brunch options: I had the eggs benedictano and he had the steak frites, ordered medium rare. To accompany our selections, we ordered the pear and cranberry cider and the maple bourbon lemonade. (Both drinks made by the fabulous bartender, Katie, who also makes mean After Eights and Monte Cristos.)  

A plate of house- made bread was brought to the table, accompanied by olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Warm, crusty and soft on the inside, we polished off that complimentary snack pretty quickly while we sipped our delicious drinks. The wait staff is clearly comfortable with time crunches of customers and took into consideration that the tables around us had a short amount of time to eat before they needed to head elsewhere. The service was swift and friendly for them, while it was a little more relaxed for us  - though by no means slow or lackadaisical.
When our brunch plates arrived, we were eager to dive in. Neither my companion nor I had been to Joe Badali's in quite some time and wondered how brunch would stack up. The portions were a good size and, importantly, cooked as they should be. My egg yolks were runny and the Canadian back bacon was a great salty accompaniment. The ciabatta base was a nice touch, as it worked well to absorb the leftover yolk on my plate. The home fries might have been a bit crispier, but the peppers and onions were crunchy contrast to the creaminess of the eggs. As for the steak frites, the steak was indeed medium rare and had been rested properly before being brought to the table. By the end of the meal, only a few pieces of diced fruit were left in our respective cups.

Since we felt like indulging at this particular brunch, we allowed ourselves to split a very generous portion of white chocolate mousse cake with strawberry topping. Not overly heavy, it was actually quite a nice way to wrap up a meal. As mentioned earlier, we also tried the After Eight and Monte Cristo specialty coffees. Topped with whipped cream and a cherry, these were decadent and deliciously boozy. We allowed ourselves a few minutes - and a couple of glasses of water - before attempting to get up.
When asked about the capacity of the place, we learned that Badali's can hold up to 750 people, making it a great place for large parties. We also discovered that they set up a secluded patio in the summers, blocking off the adjacent parking lot in order to make it a pleasant place to escape the downtown crush. If you happen to be in the area - say, before a concert, a Leafs, Raptors or Jays game - check out Joe Badali's. You're bound to find something for everyone at reasonable prices. And if you're in the mood for a drink, I highly recommend checking out either the maple bourbon lemonade or pear and cranberry cider. Had it been later in the day when we went, I suspect there may have been a few more rounds of these!

Man. This whole area is pretty packed with coffee shops and the like. Just up the road in The Junction, there's Crema, The Good Neighbour, and a Starbucks; just down the road in Roncys, there's Alternative Grounds, Coffee and All that Jazz, and yet another Starbucks. And that's just to name a few... The neighbourhood, it seems, is littered with coffee shops. So how does Hula Girl stack up against all the rest of them? Really, really nicely.

Hula Girl isn't just another boring-old coffee shop; they're an 'espresso boutique', and they focus their boutique-ish expertise on blends of Kona coffee beans and turning those blends of beans into near-perfect cups of espresso. The owners are clearly not only passionate about coffee, but knowledgeable about it too; it becomes blatantly obvious with the first sip. The espresso is noticeably balanced and brewed with a high-level of skill. Simply put, they have some truly nice people that are dam good at pulling espressos standing behind their shiny brewing machine.

No worries if espresso isn't your thing. They have some of their Kona blends brewed and served as the standard coffee fare too, which is also seriously good. They've got a nice window at the front counter with some baked goods. There isn't much there right now, as I think they've only recently started serving food, but it sure would look good stocked with some interesting, local pastries and deserts.

The space is beautiful too. Chances are, after you pick up an espresso you're going to want to stay for a bit and soak up some of the killer atmosphere. Old wood, exposed brick, shiny chrome, the entire space is exquisitely designed and faultlessly put together. Fair warning though, the insides may be pretty to look at, but they sure aren't big. It's ok though. What Hula Girl lacks in space, it makes up in comfort. Sitting around Hula Girl and sipping an espresso just feels good. The space is nice, and there's a few wooden chairs and a little bar space where relaxing music, a comfortable vibe, and fantastic coffee is all in abundance.

Chances are, they'll be busy too. People around here seem to have already shifted their morning-coffee-loyalties over to Hula Girl, and that's a good thing, for Hula Girl and you. Somehow, in this small environment, more people just make it feel cozier, which you'll appreciate. And obviously it's good for Hula Girl because they get to succeed and stick-around, and honestly, there isn't much that's nicer to see succeed than an independent business run by nice people.

Good on the folks at Hula Girl for opening up on this tired part of Dundas with its old pizza joints and 2 dollar palm reading shops. This street really needed a place like this, and no doubt the people that live there will appreciate it too. Especially among all the artsy stuff that's crept up around here, pizza and palm-readings aside, Hula Girl seems perfectly at home.

Like I said, the coffee is spectacular. So if you want some near-perfect espresso made by people that truly know what that means, then Hula Girl should be on your to-do-list; but if you're looking for a place to grab a donut and suck up some free-WiFi, keep walking up the street to The Junction or down the street to Roncys.

By the Way Cafe in the Annex sort of has the feel of eating at a friend's house, as far as the space goes anyways. It has all the elements of a cozy space that just feels comfortable and easy to relax in. 

No complaints as far as the food goes either. By the Way has a decent sized menu with enough on it to keep most people satisfied. Despite being busy, our food arrived hot and was cooked perfectly: softly-poached eggs for the bennys, light and golden fried crust on the calamari. Where By the Way loses some points is with the service. It seemed to take forever between times the server came to our table. So overall we waited quite awhile to get, well, everything, but the quality of the food made up for most of those waiting times. 

This may be one of those places that is completly hit-or-miss, but the time I was there, the food was defintiely a hit.

"So, are you going to eat a steak first?""You might want to sneak some meat in with you.""Enjoy your...vegetables."

These were not uncommon responses from folks when I said I'd be heading to Live Food Bar. I too was skeptical but went along for the ride anyways when a friend suggested we go. While perusing the online menu, I was genuinely stumped as to what I would get. I already eat at least one - but generally several - vegetarian meals a week, so I'm not opposed to eating a meal with no meat. But Live is a vegan, organic restaurant that features recipes without gluten, without sugar and certainly without any animal products which is outside my culinary experience. If you happen to feel the same way, I suggest you go with an open mind as Live has an excellent reputation and it is well earned. 

I settled in to the table at the front, which has a great view of the world walking by, of the bright, cheerful restaurant. While I waited for my dining companions, I had a look through the drink list and eventually settled on a bottle Mill Street Organic. (Should I come back in the summer, I will definitely sample the cocktails on the lovely patio!) When the ladies arrived, we ordered a bottle of organic cabernet sauvignon and started going over the menu for the millionth time. It is an extensive list with dishes that should appeal to just about all diners. Appetizers, salads, bowls, mains, pasta, dessert: Live certainly does not lack for choice. The three of us agreed that we wanted to try the chick pea fries, so we ordered those while attempting to make a decision.

Finally, we made our choices: raw sushi with pumpkin & sunflower seed nori rolls and a detox salad; "Bacon Cheese" burger; and tempeh cakes with a warm corn, avocado and white wine salsa. Orders placed, we tucked into our wine and the chick pea fries which arrived shortly thereafter. Crispy on the outside, piping hot and soft on the inside, this non-traditional take on a staple hit the spot, especially with the homemade BBQ sauce on the side.

Our mains arrived in a timely manner, and we hungrily tucked in to them. The sushi roll had a great combination of flavour and texture. I was a little jealous of not ordering that one for myself, but my giant plate of food was more than enough. The tempeh (an Indonesian soybean product) cakes were piled high on top of the wonderful salsa that was accompanied by a spicy chipotle aioli. If you're hungry, get this dish. It was undoubtedly for the best that I did not order an appetizer, as well as the cakes and sides were so surprisingly good that I was nearly scraping my plate. 

As for the "cheese bacon" burger, it passed the taste test. The patty consisted of chick peas and had macadamia cheddar "cheese" and eggplant "bacon." I can see your eyebrows raising. The eggplant had a smoky flavour and was quite good, though certainly not bacon. The cheese in question was a bit of a head-scratcher, though not unpleasant. The gluten-free bun was nicely toasted and the BBQ sauce was a great touch.

Since we had already gone through much of the menu, we thought we should give dessert a whirl. All the desserts are kept on display in near the back of the restaurant, and there is quite an array from which to choose. We opted for two: the tiramisu and the Black Forrest cake. Now, my Italian friends would be horrified to find a tiramisu without real cream, but it really was quite good with a strong, but not overpowering, taste of espresso. Similarly, the Black Forrest cake was rich, creamy and cut nicely with the cherries on top. No complaints - I certainly didn't feel like I was missing out.

Live has a great vibe to it and customers were constantly arriving either to have a seated meal or to pick up their take-out orders. The music is at just the right volume and the staff is friendly and accommodating. We were there for several hours and never felt rushed, nor got the idea that we were no longer welcome. Food arrives promptly and with a smile, water bottles are refilled, and the service is relaxed. So take your vegetarian friends, take your carnivorous friends: they will likely all be satisfied. The portions are well-sized and, most importantly, the food is delicious.

Playa Cabana Cantina is the latest restaurant to open in Toronto to fuel our newfound taco addiction in the city. It's located in The Junction at 2883 Dundas St. West (at Keele).

Playa Cabana Cantina is the second location for Playa Cabana - with it's first location on Dupont (at Davenport). The Junction has accepted it well, considering there were absolutely no reservations available for the whole weekend - but they assured me that they keep the bar open for walk ins.

So we walked in. Right away I was impressed by the decor, there's plenty of neon-lit signs including a shout out to JUNCTION - WEST TORONTO, and an "Keep and Enforce Prohibition" sign at the bar - perhaps a little tongue in cheek reference to The Junction's past as a dry neighbourhood until 2000.

The menu here is set up a little differently than other taco favourites like Grand Electric or La Carnita. Instead of ordering tapas style - one taco at a time, Playa Cantina's menu includes everything from tacos and tostados to burritos and enchiladas along with a side of rice and black or pinto beans.

We started off the meal with guacamole and chips. The chips arrived warm to the table and were extra crispy and fresh. The guacamole was smooth and not too spicy for our tastes. The bartender replenished the chips free of charge too, which is a great touch.

Playa Cabana Cantina has a fresh oyster bar set up, and at $2 a shuck, we couldn't resist them. They were huge, no skimping here, and were served with horseradish and hot sauce. Then, we each ordered a set of tacos with a side of rice and black beans, after starting off with Amber Agave Margaritas.

The Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos were served on a corn tortilla with melted cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo. They came to the table piping hot, and the mix of brisket and cheese was perfect along with the extra crispy tortilla. They were reasonably priced at $14 for an entree.

Next up was the Tacos de Pescado (Baja-Style fish tacos) for $13 . They were a little underwhelming in comparison. The breaded tilapia didn't have the substance to stand up to the guacamole and shredded cabbage filling. Usually I'm a big fan of a good fish taco but this wasn't the best I've had lately.

Personally, I prefer picking and choosing different tacos to try instead of ordering them as a personal entree. The sides of yellow rice and beans were fresh and a great addition, but it would have been great to try a few different kinds of tacos instead of three of one kind.

With another round of drinks coming, we felt the need for some dessert... Unsure of what to get, the bartender recommended the Mexican Flan, so we gave it a shot. After waiting a little longer than necessary (I think the kitchen forgot about us), our bartender arrived with the flan, which was actually 2 mini flan served with whipped cream. He apologized for the delay and said the dessert was on the house.
Overall the personal service at the bar was great, the bartender gave us a lot of recommendations on what to order and was more than helpful. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual, it didn't have that 'too cool' vibe that many new restaurants are picking up on now.

We definitely will be returning to try out the burritos and other menu items along with the amazing guacamole again too. The tacos were flavourful, with fresh, house made ingredients but not the best of what the city has to offer right now.

Pros: Good prices, friendly staff, family owned and operated. 

Cons: Took a little while to print the label, but they were able to fix the machine. 15 minutes total. I will update this next time I go. 

I live nearby and my family lives in Maine. This place was across from the US post office so I went in to check it out. New location and it's a family operated business. Pretty friendly and helpful to get my Christmas presents shipped at a reasonable price. I think it was less cost than shipping it at the post office, too. I will be using this place more often.

Totally a horrible experience! From security guards at the entrance to bar tenders, no one knows how to talk human. They're extremely rude in any question or assistance we asked. A friend got his wallet stolen and was yelled by the security guard by trying to search for it on the  floor. Lost-and-found was so useless. Will never step foot in this club again if you don't want to ruin all the fun you have while in Vegas.

Excellent location, close to Kensington Market. 

It's definitely a favourite spot for a pint or two when in the area. It's even worth a special trip for the various bands/events/televised football (soccer) games. 
I think I've seen more selfies taken in their washrooms posted than from any other area pub. They are decorated pretty cool!

As mentioned, the pints feature a great selection of both difficult to find imports and domestic items. 

The vegan food options, although limited, are available. I had the vegan shepherds pie and thought it was fantastic. Fairly priced and well presented, along with accompanying side salad. I was stuffed!

The service was friendly and competent. 

Will be back. Again and again.

My first time at this establishment (overdue!) and I will certainly be back. 
They had a great selection of food and drink. 
Fantastic and friendly service. 
I enjoyed a superb cup of coffee and was offered several different non-dairy milks for it. 
I accompanied that with my first ever pumpkin pop-tart which has set the new standard for any and all future treats to enjoy with a cuppa!
I'm looking forward to seeing live entertainment there at some point in the future too, as they have space for that as well. 
I would recommend this establishment without hesitation.

Service was poor (no silverware when my food arrived, begging for coffee/water refills...) and ambiance was dreadful. Sunday brunch and there's a middle-aged, top buttons undone, "DJ" pumping out crap from the corner of the room. Saturday night, sure, I'll expect bad dance music and deal with it but Sunday Brunch!? I asked an employee if the music could be turned down since the bass was so out of control I needed ear plugs but the volume remained the same. Cool bloody mary bar concept but it was messy, you can't make your own rim because the alcohol's already in your glass, and it always seems a little unsanitary...My food was decent but this place is trying too hard and is not good enough for a return.

Pretty tacky place but gotta love a rooftop?! Food was pretty gross American Mexican food. My taco salad was just like what you'd get at Eddie's under Towers. At least corn tortillas were an option for a taco, though. The margaritas tasted like jolly ranchers but my mimosa had a generous champagne to oj ratio. I'd go back to hang out on the roof..

I have dealt with many apartment complexes, but this place by far is the worst place EVER! The manager Janice Lee is the worst part of the living there. She is most disrespectful, unhelpful and rude manager I have encountered. They kept our deposit even after their walk through claiming they were very happy with how clean we left the apartment. When we moved in we already had our own fridge so they took theirs out. Once we moved out they accused us of stealing their fridge and kept the deposit. Janice refused to even look into our situation and just said "do whatever you want because we are keeping your deposit". Go on Google and read their other terrible reviews. They suck. Whatever you do, save yourself a headache and deposit, and stay far away from this stupid place and worthless "manager"

I sought out the new b-dubs in downtown Kent. Having never been to the new location I was impressed with the building and T.V set up and everything else. Very impressive however it ended there our waitress on a dead afternoon came by 4 times and really didn't talk the even ask us how the food was she would just grab our drinks with no heads up and bring them back. Really frustrating service. Very disappointed because with only 3 other tables being served on the floor by other ppl idk what in the hell could keep you from providing some decent service

I wanted to take a second to write a review about Dr. Degen along with his office staff. What a stressful time it was dealing with a double failed root canal, and after a few visits with a few different doctors,  I was able to get different opinions, but I decided to come back to Dr Degen for treatment. I felt as if he was most honest, very confident and I never once felt rushed, he answered all my questions and concerns. I had previous nerve issues and honestly just felt scared to have any more dental work done.  He made my fears become so calm and I just trusted that he would do his absolute best! I got teeth 31 & 32 extracted and both my top wisdom teeth removed all in one visit. His office manager Cory is fantastic and was very helpful from the beginning , even after 50 questions... the front and back office was super friendly, helpful and always smiling. I'm sure it makes for a great place to work and as a patient I would most definitely return in the future if needed.  I have found a wonderful office and just pleased with my decision to have chosen him as my doctor- Post care was just as great of experience and would highly recommend there office! Very clean office too! :)

I suppose that I have some explainin' to do, considering that my group of 3 friends and I dropped $500 on dinner here yet only gave it 3 stars. 

So, let me start with the sides. We tried the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, gold yukon potato puree and asparagus. The hen of the woods mushrooms were quite good, but nothing I can't put together myself. They had no great sauce, no POW factor. The gold yukon potatoes were fine - nice potatoes that were boiled and pureed to baby-food texture. No special or unique flavors going on there. Finally, I'm convinced the asparagus was just microwaved in some water. Very poor effort there, guys. Considering each of these dishes was $15-$25, I'm very disappointed. 

Now, onto some better things. I had the lobster bisque which was very good. Nice and creamy with succulent chunks of lobster. The only complaint I have, if it even counts, is that they served me a ton. It was very rich and I didn't have a cup of bisque, it was a giant bowl. 

On to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here, nothing; just pure steak goodness. It was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered. 

Overview: The service was impeccable. The wine list was extensive (however out of our price range, at $125 per person without drinks). Though the steaks and bisque were great, the sides were eerily reminiscent of my grandmothers (terrible) cooking. I think Craftsteak is a poor value for your buck, therefore I'll give it 3/5 - A-OK.

Stopped by Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay while having a great weekend with old college friends in Vegas.  Burger Bar definitely added to the great weekend.

Let's start with the drinks - they have an excellent beer selection, including fat tire which is one of my favorites.  Pitcher for $22 = very happy me.

Their burgers were cooked to perfection and included fresh, very tasty ingrediants that matched some of the other upscale burger places I've been - like Five Napkin in Manhatten.  I had the Black Jack Burger, which I can attest was fantastic.  My friends also enjoyed the American Classic, Black Angus Beef and Original Ultimate Burgers.

As far as sides, I tried their sweet potato fries as others on Yelp have said they are fantastic - I thought they were good but nothing special.  If I were to go back and I would probably go with regular fries.

Finally, the atmosphere was great.  Very modern place and it was packed, everyone was having a great time.  Great experience, I would definitely recommend.

Service With A Smirk.

Went in to buy a snack , and asked the kid behind the counter how much one of the brownies was, and if it was plain (no nuts). Looked everywhere but where I was standing, and said "Looks that way." Condescending as hell. Two dollars for a stale brownie, and stale service. Never again.

Granted this company is cheap but they are cheap for a reason. So first I get a gray Nissan Sentra I think it was and I was very unimpressed by the condition of the car. Then I'm driving on the highway and the car damn near stalls out on me and could have gotten me killed! I was close to the rental office so I took it back and demanded that I get a different car and be compensated for my troubles. I got a different car but instead of the company trying to make up for it and put me in something nicer they give me a car that had ink stains everywhere! As far as compensation goes the manger told me they would have to get it checked out as if I was making it up and after a few hours how did I know that they would call back and say nothing was wrong with the car?! Overall, I didn't like the whole rental experience from this company and never get in a gray Nissan! It might save your life!

Fun place to be...esp.during spring training time. If you're into getting autographs it's easy here during spring training. I'm not even that into sports but I'm originally from Ohio and my friend (ohio friend) comes here esp.for spring training (she loves the Cleveland Indians who train here along with the Cincinatti Reds).  The amount of signatures and pics of players we've gotten over the years is amazing.  The games are fun to watch...I just chill and drink a margarita. The whole ball park is so family friendly. They do events. My family enjoys the halloween event.

Great food. They keep it simple here by not allowing for substitutions. You just pick a number on the menu that matches what you want. Pretty much anything you order is delicious. This used to be a little hole in the wall but they re-did it - expanding the space and making it more modern looking. If you love chicken and waffles and basically comfort food, then this is the spot. It's busy at lunch time.  Each time there has been a good experience.

I am so happy I chose Dr. Nachbar for my breast augmentation.  Surgery (cosmetic) or not is a big decision. His website was very informative - advising people the proper questions to ask cosmetic surgeons. The staff was welcoming and kind (especially Tammy). Dr. Nachbar is realistic with clients about their expectations. He does not impose any preferences and allows you the client to make the proper decision for yourself (ex: how many ccs to get for your breasts).  He is  very energetic and you can tell he loves what he does. His sense of humor helps diffuse any nervousness you have when talking with him. I had my breast augmentation done May 2, 2014, and I'm still happy with the results. His description of the healing process and what to expect during recovery was on point. Thanks Dr. Nachbar for giving me a lil more pep in my step.

I stopped by Noosa this past week and had a great time! The soy salmon was a delicious meal. I sat at the bar because I came in alone so I didn't want to take up a table. After about a minute of me sitting down I realized I made a good choice! The bartenders working were AMAZING! Not only did they give great service they were entertaining and fun to talk to! Both Tiana and Jay or "T" and "J" ( which is what they told me to call them) addressed me by my first name the entire night instead of "sir" or "Mr" which gave very friendly vibes. They made sure my drink was always full and that I was satisfied with everything I ordered. I will definitely be back and am sitting at the bar again even if I had other people with me. GREAT FOOD even better service! But like I said I recommend sitting at the bar area and ask for "T" and "J"!

I cannot express my gratitude enough for A&M. We returned from out of town Sunday night to discover our a/c was broken...this leading into a heat advisory and 110+ temperatures. We got A&M as a referral and gave them a call. They said they would be out between 1 and 2, but would call first. At 1:10 we got a call that they were on their way. For the next 3 hours, Bill, the technician, spent his time professionally and diligently fixing our a/c. He even made sure to let me know that the damage was covered by warranty and I would only be paying labor (which was so reasonable considering the conditions -- up on the roof and in the heat!!). He was sweet, gentle and kind to my dog (despite her incessant barking) and incredibly friendly with me. I couldn't ask for a better experience to fix my a/c in sweltering heat. Thank you, Bill!

I had my eyelashes done a few years ago, and loved them. They were a bit too long, but they lasted well over two months and were surprisingly were very low maintenance. The woman who did it just said not to be rough with them, to not use mascara, and to use oil free remover.

I wanted eyelash extensions again for a trip I was taking on a Friday. The Sunday before my trip, I went to this location for a petite set. I was given a packet of materials, and part of it said to get your lashes done at least a few days before an event. Lucky me, I thought, because I was going about 4 days before leaving. I figured my lashes would last for at least a few weeks and then I'd have to get a touch up to just fill in empty spots. Boy, was I wrong.

First of all, the woman who worked on my eyes must not have washed her hands. I could smell a strong peanut butter smell, and those little latex finger things they use didn't help. 

Second, my lashes lasted for less than a week and a half, despite me following their instructions to the letter. I didn't wear any eye makeup for several days before, I didn't wash my eyes the day I got them and for a couple of days after, and I barely wore any eye makeup at all and definitely did not use mascara. When I did wear eye makeup, I used makeup remover that was oil free and meant for lash extensions. I was on vacation but didn't swim or submerge my head. When I took a shower, I kept my face out of the water at all times. Even with me being extremely careful, every time I blinked another lash would fall off. By the end of the week they were 90% gone.

I was extremely disappointed with the lashes. I am also pretty suspicious of the fact that they push you to get an annual membership so you can get a refill once month. 

Anyway, I'm glad I got a Groupon for this because I would have been even more mad if I had paid full price ($250). Never coming here again.

Just had my carpets and furniture (upholstery) cleaned by Bill M. with Trademark Carpet Services. They looked stunning and smell so refreshing. Trademark Carpet Services uses top of the line cleaning equipment. They even showed me how the equipment works and how much dirt was being removed.

Thanks for your hard work, Bill. I look forward to using you again in 6 months.

I give this shady, unprofessional, worthless RV dealership a ZERO!!! Do NOT buy your RV from them. You are better off purchasing a RV from an out-of-state dealership such as Utah or Arizona. 
We bought an $84K fifth-wheel from this place and we had a horrible experience starting from the receptionist all the way to the general manager. The sales staff is a joke. They are lazy, unprofessional, smokers and drunks. They think they are too good (arrogant). The management is a bunch of shady, incompetent liars. They shift the blame onto their subordinates, or they make you sound as if you are the one who is wrong or mistaken.
The service department is just as bad. They tell you that they have fixed/repaired the parts, but when you get it home, nothing works properly. They also keep your trailer for weeks at a time, so if you plan on using it, good luck getting it back on time for your next trip. 
Trust me, they rig everything. 
DO NOT buy from this dealership. Save yourself the time, money and headache by purchasing from out of state.

Incompetance, unprofessional, stupidity and inaccuracy is how i would describe the management of this facility. 
If you read their response to by initial review, you will find they make reference to my "displacement of my fob key, or to be specific, "I didnt place my fob key in a convenient place." (Same thing). Well, that is completely inaccurate. It's apparent that this manager is stating FALSE information. If you recall correctly, I had my husband's vehicle with his set of keys and he had my vehicle with my set of keys (which OBVIOUSLY would have MY key fob on my key chain). Therefore, tell me how this is NOT putting my key fob in a "convenient place?" Really? Are you that stupid? Having my key fob on my key chain is NOT a convenient place? This manager clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. As I said previously, I wasn't trying to scam the gym by getting 2 keys fobs. I am not a deceitful person. All I asked is for this facility to provide me with a way to get into their gym, "that I fund," if I didn't have my set of keys. They talk about providing security, but i guess they prefer that you to wait until a customer leaves the gym, grabbing the door behind them, before it closes, in order to get jn. This is what I had to do on several occasions, as I didnt have my set of keys with my key fob. And each time this happened, there was NO staff member present around 7pm to even IDENTIFY me. Do you call this security? I could have been a "non-member" walking into the gym for free. What a joke!!! This leads me into my next question...what is one to do when they forget their key fob and no staff memeber is present, to let you into the gym after 5:30pm? Are you supposed to go home and abandon your workout for the day? I know I am NOT the ONLY person out there that this has happened to. 
As an owner of my own company, I believe in conflict resolution, honesty and customer service. So let me be the mature, managerial, adult here and say humbly, that my comment on the early termination fee was incorrect. The $341 fee was my contractual commitment. I realize this was my contractual responsibility, which is why I paid it. So I stand corrected on this. Why doesnt this gym offer an APOLOGY to me, rather than be argumentative and flippant???
Bottom line, these people are not real business men, because they should know that you don't argue with a "paying customer." Obviously their egos are more important than their customers. But what can you expect from a mediocre, gym manager? You're NOT that important.

If you are looking for a no hassle car buying experience Rodeo Kia is the place. We purchased our first Kia Soul in 2016. I called Rodeo and gave the sales manager the specifics on what we were looking for. But I also stated we were not 100 per cent sure. There was no pressure. Three days later we picked up the exact car we wanted no hassle what so ever. Recently I started reading the reviews on the 2018 Soul and some of the new features were changes that made us think about taking a closer look. Well last week Rashad (he did our paper work last year) left me a voicemail just checking in and we are now driving the 2018 Soul Plus and we could not be happier!

This is by far the worst experience I've ever had with any car rental company. The agent was rude, did not to her job in checking that the car was damaged (had to come up and tell her as she didn't take a look at the car whatsoever) and I was given a filthy vehicle that had dirt in the floor mats and bird poop on the chair in the back! Before I picked up the car, I asked what the 'other' charges were on my bill (amounted to about 1/3 of the price) and she didn't know. 
When I mentioned the car was dirty and had a strong smell, she told me I was wrong because she cleaned the car herself.
Any attempts to fix the situation with the location were fruitless as I was told multiple things by multiple people and nothing ever came of it for weeks even though I called back once a week to try and discuss the situation. I finally went through Avis' customer service who solved the issue and they provided excellent customer service.
I'd like to stress the following: as a company Avis is great, it's this particular location that seems to employ rude employees and is owned/managed by a woman whom they called "Mrs. Mary" who does not seem to value her customers or giving good service of any kind. There are plenty of other Avis locations to rent from in Montreal, please choose one of them instead!

Bad food, worse service. Skip it.
We went on a quiet weekend when there was plenty of staff and open tables but lack of organization seemed to be rampant. The food really wasn't anything special and the service was terribly slow and not all that friendly. Also, the trays that the pizzas are brought out directly on are thenstored ON THE FLOOR/SIDEWALK once we were done. Absolutely disgusting.

I definitely plan on going back to have Byron add to it. The shop is very clean and inviting and everyone is very friendly. The artists are truly very talented. You can view each artists' work on their website. If you are looking to get a tattoo, I would definitely recommend Black Lotus Tattooers!

This place is the best! I used to eat lunch at this location all the time because it was near work. Not only is the food fantastic but the service is too! The manager Jeremy is so friendly and helpful. I stop here whenever I can for a delicious and healthy bite to eat.

Favorites here are the Chicken Tortilla soup, the Salsa Verde Shrimp tacos and the Grilled Gourmet Chicken tacos.

Went to Sapphire Friday night and was impressed with the interior and the service they provided.  After they sat me down on my reserved table that's were it went downhill.  Everyone expected a tip for everything.  I had a two hour open bar and every time I ordered a drink the server would ask for a tip.  When I got vip dances they make you buy drinks and they add taxes and don't expect your change back because they'll just keep it as a tip.  I give this place 3 stars just because it does seem like an upscale type of place and it does have plenty of beautiful women. But the main reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 is because the girl I was with was really cool.  She was one of the rare ones that will actually talk to you even if you tell her no.  She was so full of energy and really kind I had to get a dance and boy could she dance.  I planned on being there for about two hours,  I stayed for over 6 hours just talking with her and getting a few dances here and there.  She definitely gets 5 stars.  If you want to have a good time and not just another girl trying to take your money talk to Evelyn she's got a great personality and serious skills at dancing.

Worst place for breakfast in Gilbert, horrible food. This place really needs to invest in a real cook.
Will never come back, period.
We estimated that half of the patrons sent thier food back (at least one time, some folks had to send back more than once) and the smug servers were totally unphased, they must be used to it.
Save yourself the headache and go somewhere, anywhere, else. This dump only survives on the overflow from the Farmhouse next door.

Stopped going here after all the heath code violations but thought we'd give it one more shot last Friday, wish we hadn't.
Even with reservations we waited over an hour for our food, not because it was busy but because they sat us at a table by ourselves but wouldn't start cooking until more people came in to fill up the table.
It was well over 90 degrees in the restaurant, despite every person complaining they would not or could not help the situation.
Lastly the food is horrible and way overpriced, the "show" was a non-starter as well. 
They do still have the dragon lady walking around, frowns for everyone. SMH.

Ordered online with over 24 hours notice for my daughters birthday.   Picked up my order (which was not what I ordered) at the pick up time requested.  When I got to the store was greeted by a nice young girl who made sure I knew this was just her second day and that she was alone.  When I told her what I ordered and she could not locate my order she proceeded to call her manager, that manager was just has helpful as the 2 day employee.  Needless to say since I had prepaid for the cupcakes, I took whatever was on hand.  No discount or reimbursement for the wrong order.

I couldn't be more pleased with the arrangements they made for my daughter's baptism. The center pieces included ivory roses and hydrangeas. They were so beautiful and elegant! I didn't need any other decorations at my reception venue because the flowers were so lovely. The head table arrangement was my favorite, bigger and more elaborate than the other center pieces. It was so beautiful, elegant and sophisticated--totally exceeded my expectations! They delivered everything to the venue on time, which made the day much less stressful for me. Additionally, their customer service was exceptional, they were just wonderful, easy to work with and very accommodating.

I've been disappointed with florists in the past because you typically get something smaller and more disappointing than what is advertised in photos. VIP Floral Designs delivered the opposite--something bigger and better than what I expected! I couldn't be happier with my experience with them. I highly recommend this florist.

Very obviously lots of holiday lets which can raise argument for and against, but well done to the residents. Beautiful, historical and a place I would want to visit again.

Terrible experience. I bought 4 tires from a different NTB, it included free tire rotations. I was in the area so came to this location to get them rotated. While they were doing that the mechanic came out and told me my struts were leaking oil and needed to be replaced, said he could do it for $900. I thought this was weird because I had just taken my car in to the dealer to get an oil change and if they could have sold me new struts I'm sure they would have. When I said I'd think about it he tried to get me to sign up for their credit card, said "he was just trying to help me out."

The next weekend I took my car to a mechanic I trust and he told me the struts were in good shape and not leaking anything - so NTB was either trying to rip me off or are incompetent.

To further lower my opinion of this shop, a few days after the rotation my car said all the tire pressures were low - they didn't even do that right.

Went here after Christmas to build a stair railing. All the wood for the precut kits was warped. Tried to find an employee to ask about steel or aluminum options. When I eventually found one, they couldn't help me but said they would call someone else. Waited 20 minutes for help then left in frustration.

Passed a group of 6 employees hanging around talking at the front of the store. Very frustrating, won't shop here again.

I had their mushroom schnitzel on rice, so delicious and not greasy or dry. My husband and daughter had their cabbage rolls with potato and it was a hit with my picky daughter.  

The owners are so friendly and helpful.

Love the clean friendly atmosphere here.  I go regularly and so was looking forward to the New Years Eve party.  It was awful.  The band was the only good part.  They served Chex Mix and tostitos with salsa as the "snacks".  Really?  Not enough places to sit down, not enough drink stations. People in the crowd were rude and pushy. A $35 ticket was a waste.  I would rather have had a nice dinner somewhere else.

If you think that the place isn't a hangout, just count the number of bar stools.  Ought tell you something.

2.95 PBR  beers turned me in.  But do try a bowl of the house's chilli.  Ask for your onions and cheese on the side.  Mix it how you like.  The Cook has a winning recipe!

At check-in Cibola Resort folks mentioned The Haymaker (when you go show your room key for a pleasant benefit).

We were sat in 1 of the 2 booths facing the bar.  Shielded from all the commoners (ha). Travis our Server, turned out to be the Bar Tender.  Great attitude and great service.  Made the statement that he figured we were staying at Cibola because "everyone around here has been here before, and knows the menu, including breakfast, is served all day long.".

Pleasant place.

We got the Oriental chicken salad and chili.  Breading on the chicken was very good.  You should ask for a extra thing of dressing with your order.

The fried green tomato BLT with a avocado was good and juicy.

If it wasn't my lunch time, I'd have tried one of the Eggs Benedict that Travis bragged on about.

Ok it is past 6 pm, Mike and Jill can handle it. See photo

I refuse to accept this dis-honest behaviour!! I caught this cab from the airport to downtown Calgary and tipped the drive $9, how can the airport let this firm be a contractor/service for their airport??

This food here is fantastic! My wife and I eat vegetarian most of the time, and this is one of our mainstay restaurants for take-out nights. But don't let the 'vegetarian' label scare you off, this is just damn good Indian food by any standard.

Our usual order is the aloo paratha (potato bread), masala dosa (dosa stuffed with spicy potato), and the chana masala (chana dal in a liquidy masala sauce with rice). One order of each of those is enough food to stuff two people, for a total of $18.53+tax+tip. Note that's 1 order of each of those, total, not 1 for each person.

I'm docking one star because the service when you eat in is lacklustre to say the least. Most of the time they don't seem to care whether you get water, take your order in any reasonable time, etc.

But the food is good enough to keep me coming back again and again for take-out.

Got home from the airport last night (Sunday) at 11 pm. No food in the house, and starving. Check what's open: Mi Gia Phung. Why not try it?

Ordered the deep fried spring rolls, the large Thai-style pho (me) and the medium vegetarian pho (Jackie). All were delicious.

Apparently they don't necessarily close at midnight, it's whenever they stop getting business, which "might be 11 pm, might be 2 am". So that's kind of annoying because you can't count on them being open if you roll in at 11:15 pm, but if you're lucky they might be open even later.

Most importantly though, the food was delicious and the waitress was friendly (I think her parents might own the place? They were hanging out in the back.) Will definitely return.

Let's start with the positive: the pastries, baguette, and sandwiches here are great. (I haven't tried the quiche.) The country-style pate sandwich is my favourite.

The reason I only give it three stars is because of the service. And not that the staff aren't helpful - they are. They're great. It's just that there are never enough of them. Twice I've come here and there is only a SINGLE person trying to cover the cash register, make coffee, get pastries for people, and serve tables. Totally impossible!

Or during the lunch rush, there might be TWO people. They still can't keep up. They're trying, but they can't keep up. It ends up being a frustrating experience for me, and I'm sure it's frustrating for them, too. I really wanted to love this place --- it's very close to my house --- but I just can't deal with the lineups when taking things to go, and slow service when eating in the restaurant.

If they only did coffee and take-out pastries and baguette, it would be fine, but with sandwiches and quiche, and table service, and fancy coffees, it just doesn't work.

So this three-star review is not really aimed at the food, or the staff: I'm hoping that the owners read this and start putting some more employees in the restaurant!

The Works is one of my regular stops for a spontaneous restaurant meal on the Danforth. Solid beers (I like the Barking Squirrel), ridiculously good fried pickles with spicy mayo, and a great selection of burger toppings. I always order one of the pre-selected combinations (usually something spicy) rather than choosing my own toppings. Poutine for a side is also great - better curds than many places. Did I mention that I'm not watching my calories when I come here? The veggie burgers, which my wife gets every time, are also apparently great - I haven't tried it yet though.

Every time I've been, we've been seated quickly and service has been good, even when in a big group.

Being located near Donlands, The Works is easily walkable from the Danforth/Greenwood area or Greektown. Highly recommended for nights when you just feel like a great burger and appetizers!

I moved into East Danforth this past summer, had my first appointment with Dr. Petrou last week. His office is small, with just a tiny sign outside. But that doesn't matter, what matters for an optometrist, at least for me, is (a) competence, and (b) friendliness. Dr. Petrou had both.

It was just a simple eye exam, but he was patient and explained to me what was going on with my eyes (I got 0.5 dioptres worse over the last year, which has me very concerned), explained what I can do to slow the degeneration, and discussed my glasses, contacts, and the possibility of laser eye surgery. (Not an option: they want to see stability for 2 years before considering it, so that you don't get the laser surgery only to need glasses again in a year.) Anyway, we discussed my options and then he re-ordered my contacts for me; same brand as I was already using, so that was nice.

His secretary showed up late so when I got there for my morning appointment, he was answering the phone (in Greek!) and scheduling appointments himself. He seemed to accept this with a sort of patient resignation; I get the feeling it wasn't the first time it had happened.

Anyway, this is not a flashy office, and most of the patients seem to be older, but I would highly recommend giving Dr. Petrou a call.

The food, service, and staff at the Gourmet Deli are all authentic and excellent.  On the wall they have written their full menu on the black board; it is a mix of New York Deli, Southern European cuisine and Italian restaurant.  All of the specialties are created by Carlo, or Emilie and reveal their Italian & French heritage.  
I have been for lunch many times and have enjoyed ordering my favorites that remind me of the New York Deli's I grew up on.  Most recently I have been just ordering the special of the day; today was a French lentil soup created by Emilie and it was wonderful.
The service is very fast, especially considering every dish is created to order.  Over time they have been busier and they seem to have increased their staff to keep up their service level.

Nathan and his company seem very trust worthy and responsive.  They were able to replace a battery and fit in a few scheduled maintenance issues without an appointment.  What was impressive is watching them work with several  customers while I waited; they are very focused on their reputation and long term relationship with customers, not a one time money grab.  I will work with them again, I hope my next experience is the same.

I am sad to report poor experiences with the service department of  Chapman BMW.  Before their move to the new facility in Chandler they performed well for me but now they seem very comfortable and boarding on arrogance with the limited choices available to BMW owners.  What is most disturbing about their attitude was a lack of interest in determining a solution to the problem of a safety critical component of the car.  They spent all of their time attempting to limit or eliminate their responsibility.  Babbitt is an excellent alternative to Chapman BMW and I have given up on the dealer.

Motorcycles of Charlotte is a fantastic store for enthusiastic motorcycle riders. The staff is very knowledgeable and helps in every matter. For Triumph riders it is a pleasure to spend money there, because you get a great customer service and help after the purchase. The part department is a great help too and could answer all of my countless questions regarding accessories for my Street Triple. The service department does a great job of taking care of the bike. If you want to finance the bike, the business and sales team gives you excellent advise. Allover, fantastic store, fantastic European bikes, fantastic customer experience. 

Last but not least, ask for an insurance quote at the store. It doesn't cost anything, but could you save a lot of money. In my case over $600 per year.

I highly recommend the trolley pub! Vincent, our pilot, was a wonderful guide. We had such a fun time and it was the absolute perfect thing to do for a night on the town with friends. We did the Uptown tour, but the Noda tour sounds awesome too. It was raining for a lot of the trip yet we still managed to have a ton of fun, drink plenty of beers, and jam out with the speaker Vincent provided.

Two words: cheddar biscuit. If you're a fan of biscuits and cheese, and who isn't, this spot is a must try for breakfast or brunch. I get the #3 egg, cheddar, and avocado on a cheddar biscuit and it may be one my favorite breakfast sandwiches of all time. I think many others tend to agree as Saturday mornings at the Dilworth Sunflower location are busy. The space is on the smaller side, so plan on feeling a bit crammed, and possibly waiting a bit for seating and/or your food. To-go orders are always an option. It's worked out fine each Saturday that I've gone and I've definitely left happy with a full tummy. 

Though I haven't tried their pastries and desserts, they look amazing. Sunflower even has a number of vegan desserts, you're into that kinda thing. They do have a full coffee and tea bar. The green tea latte is delicious!

I must say that I'm disappointed with Alexander Michael's. For the most part, each time I've dined there I've enjoyed the food. I'm a huge fan of the veggie burger and fries, and the prices are reasonable. The space is great, and I adore the 4th Ward neighborhood. In fact, I live there. 

That said, I've been consistently underwhelmed with the quality of service that Al Mike's delivers to its patrons. On a couple of occasions I've felt as though the server did not really care much about my dining experience. As an example, recently I went with a friend who explained to the server that she was gluten intolerant and order the GF pasta. Despite that, her pasta came with two slices of bread on top. To me, that seems like something that should have been considered, and if it was an honest mistake, that would have been ok. However, the server acted as though it was preposterous that she asked for another plate. She was extremely disrespectful despite the fact that my party was respectful towards her. I really want to like and enjoy this spot and I think the food is great, but the experience of eating out is 100 percent framed by your service and on a couple of occasions it's been subpar to horrible at Al Mike's.

The $10 all you can eat lunch special was on point. There are probably 20 or more rolls to pick from, including tempura rolls, a philly roll, and a couple vegetarian rolls. It great that you can also get small orders of noodles and alike. The service was quick, and we didn't do much waiting for food despite putting in 4 rounds of orders. I'd highly recommend the lunch special! The space was cool and interesting as well.

Sea Level is one of my favorite new restaurants in Charlotte. I've been in a couple of times with my boyfriend and so far we've tried the shrimp po-boy, catfish reuben, lobster roll, and $1 Sea level oysters. Everything was delicious, but the catfish reuben was the real stand out dish. The sandwiches all come with french fries, which are really tasty. The lobster roll could use a little more butter drizzled on top, but that's my only critique of the food so far. 

What I really love about Sea Level is that it seems to strike a great balance of semi-fine dining, while also being casual, if that's what your mood is. To that end, there's a big patio, and a good bit of bar seating, so even on a busy weekend evening, you may be able to be seated without a reservation at one of the aforementioned locations. Additionally, the service is fabulous. The servers are very professional - They know their stuff and they ensure patrons have a great dining experience. Finally, I love that there are cheaper options (i.e. $2 beer, $5 house wines, ~$12 sandwiches, and $1 oysters), and there are plenty of high quality, more expensive options as well. You really can achieve whatever dining experience you are looking for at Sea Level, whether is be a nice date, casual happy hour drinks and oysters, or somewhere in between!

I grew up in Little Italy amongst the best Nona's in the country and had an unforgettable memory of what good Italian was supposed to taste like.  Short of going to a top Italian restaurant, this is it ... Real Italian flavor with top quality ingredients.  You can purchase frozen entrees, appetizers, and side dishes as well as fresh pasta and sauces.  If you zip home before the family or guests arrive and put it in your own cookware for heating, the house will smell amazing and they'll think you are a professional cook.  The store is owned and operated by family and a lot of love goes into everything they make.  The fresh pasta is what separates their products from the rest...it is outstanding.  Unlike the reviewer who rated it a three without tasting the products, I have sampled most products and they have all been excellent.  Anyone I've sent there (many), have been equally impressed.  Give them a try and say Janice sent you.  Whether I am doing my own Italian cooking or just want it done for me, I always start with at least their pasta.  Enjoy!

First time here tonight! My husband & I took a trip to Las Vegas & I yelped near by restaurants that were open late & El Dorado Cantina pops up. I have to say this place is phenomenal! From the nice ambiance, nice servers to the amazing Street Tacos, let's not forget the flan! It's a MUST have. I'm a Latina & I know what flan is supposed to taste like, and this was AMAZING!! Chef Paco was very sweet & took the time to introduce himself to us. I will definitely be coming back before I head back to the OC.

I was asked to make cake pops for a baby shower and without thinking about how busy I was agreed of course. While I was stressing about how I would find the time to make the cake pops the living social deal came across my email. I figured it was fate:) I purchased the 2 dozen cake pops for $25 deal and then scheduled my order the next
Day. I wasnt picky,  just requested whatever colors and flavors I could get for the deal and not have to pay anything extra.  I went yesterday after work to pick up the pops and was thoroughly impressed with the end results! Not only were the cake pops ready when I arrived, but they were absolutely darling! Definitely above and beyond what I expected for my $25 deal. I couldnt resist trying one (the shower is tonight) and as I thought they taste amazing as well. Well done Michelle! I am surprised there arent more positive comments on here. I feel like everyone always takes the time to leave negative comments but its also important to remember to leave the positive ones. Give this new business a try!!

Rooms are essentially new and are incredibly well decorated (wish my house looked this nice). While I didn't get an opportunity to eat at the Blue Hound, I did have drinks there and it was definitely a nice environment. Will be back in Phoenix this January and I will definitely be staying here again.

Attempted to enjoy this restaurant twice when it was Extreme Sushi and was disappointed both times. With the change in ownership and name I thought it was time to try again. I had high hopes, but again they were not met. The service was ok, but nothing exceptional. The selection on the menu was good, but the actual food was disappointing. The rolls were creative, but piece size and ingredient distribution were inconsistent. The Sushi pieces were small and the rice didn't hold together. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but I expect perfection when it comes to sushi and only one place has met that expectation... Kobe Sushi on the 215 and Rainbow.

After having consigned about about 20 items with the original owner, whom I was very satisfied with, she was so awful to work with.

Don't let your cab driver talk you out of going here.  Mine tried to, something about the recession and "old" food and bad neighborhoods and and and.  I think he was just OCD or something.  

This little Italian place has very good food, the prices are reasonable for Las Vegas and a lot less than what you would pay for a comparable meal on the strip.  The bruschetta appetizer was light, flavorful, and on a piece bread toasted just right.  My ribeye steak with a reduced balsamic sauce was cooked just right and I would definitely have it again.

So the what are the downsides?  Well it is located off of the strip in the lobby of an apartment building between a Papa John's pizza and a massage parlor.  Sounds worse than it really is.  Its Vegas.  There a A LOT of massage parlors around!  The Caesar salad was a bit bland for my taste, but still pretty good.  The restaurant was also not as busy as I would like.  There were only three parties in the place on a Thursday night during the peak dinner hour.  I have no idea why this place is not busier, but it does make for a nice quiet atmosphere and great service.  Go figure.

Staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas for our annual summer trip when we craved some pizza. So I yelped pizza and Bistro came up with the best reviews so we decided to give it a try. 

The pizza was so good with the most perfect crust. My husband had their spaghetti /meatballs and  really enjoyed it. The food was good and so was the service. The young guys behind the counter were really nice and just friendly.... Had to find in chain restaurants nowadays. 

Will definitely go back when we're in town.

Just came here with some friends and couldn't leave without writing a review. Ordered the Assorted Plate (pork skirt, pork butt, pork jowl, pork belly with and without skin) and the quality of the meat is fresh - which can explain the $59.99 price tag for the plate. The servers are very attentive even though it got a little busy. The decor is very quaint and has an elementary school theme and I'm glad we tried it out. We will definitely be coming back!

I wanted to discuss a skin condition I had to explore my options, she walked in and said "What do you want to do?"  When I told her I though that's why I was there she said "well your insurance won't pay of it" and never any discussion.  I left frustrated, and upset with myself that I didn't ask to see someone else.  I waited 6 weeks for the appointment.  Wasted so much of my time!

This is my happy place!  Discovered it about 3 weeks ago and I've been here 6 times.  My husband and I have tried the philly, gyro and burger. For me... I can't stay away from that Philly... the perfect ratio of mushroom, onion cheese and juicy meat.  It all blends together to a perfect, almost creamy bite every time.  Everything is made to order so it's really hot and fresh.  I love the steak fries that are always well seasoned.  The restaurant itself is very clean and the staff are very nice and polite.

I keep telling myself I'm going to try the gyro salad but I'll save that for after the new year when I get on the scale after the holidays.  For now I'm blissfully happy just thinking about this hidden gem.

I've eaten downtown and enjoyed my meal so I was excited when it opened at Suncoast.   I really should have read the Yelp reviews before I came.  Zucchini sticks were bland and cold in the center.  Pot pie tasted like celery and there was 4 small pieces of chicken, also cold.  The meatloaf is the worst thing I ever eat, cold and hard... No amount of pasty gravy made it edible.     Then the check came and I was so angry that I wasted that amount of money on worthless food!

This has restaurant has been on my bucket list for a while and since eating there last night it has earned a spot in my regular rotation.  Arrived about 6:30 pm and waited about 30 minutes.  Service was very fast and definitely adequate, we received a carafe of water and pot of hot tea which was all we really needed.

The food was outstanding. I was a little nervous it would be dangerously spicy after looking at some of the reviews but it was spot on!  My nose ran a little which for me is a good thing when eating Sichuan.   Everything is highly seasoned and perfectly flavorful.  

The menu is extensive and includes pictures (helpful). We had the jelly noodle appetizer, toothpick lamb, tan tan noodles and special fried rice.   This was a lot of food for two people but we never mind leftovers.  In fact, I got up early this morning to eat them before my husband woke up!

The place is loud (in a good way).  We had a large boisterous party of about 12 next to us but as soon as the food came they got very quiet.   I'm planning my next visit already.

If you have only been at Halloween time I think you are missing out.  The true farm/orchard experience is on a regular non-holiday weekend, you can wander the orchard and scarcely see another person, pick veggies and not wait it line!

True, you can't get apple cider donuts but the peace and serenity is worth the trade off .   On those weekends you will absolutely forget you are in Las Vegas.

Great food and service!  Come last night right when they were closing (accidentally). We were standing outside the door because we thought we were too late.  The cashier saw us and waived us in with a big smile.   The cashier was beyond knowledgeable and helpful with the menu.  We received out food very quickly and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The Cherry Popper Burger was outstanding and the truffle fries are addicting.   One of the very best burgers in town. All the staff were friendly and happy and we never felt rushed, even though we were the last ones there.  This was my third time there and the food just keeps getting better and better.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.

One word to describe this place, balls! The service was one of the worst I've ever experienced. It took them 45 minutes to bring our food out. They had 1 server and one sushi chef working and there were 7 tables seated just at the patio alone

The guy that seated us didn't look like he worked there. The only xtreme thing about this place was the dude's shirt. The waitress didn't even thank us after. The sushi was decent. Definitely not worth the service. Balls I tell you, balls!!

There are a lot of pho restaurants in this town. This one is my favorite for 3 reasons. 

Reason #1 - It's got the word "pho" in the name, so you know it's good.

Reason #2 - They are from "Saigon", where pho was invented, so you know they know what they are doing here.

Reason #3 - The number "8" is a very humbling number to give ones self. It's better then 5 and not as douchey as 10.  So you know they've got class.

Yup, the humblest, most authenticest, phoiest restaurant on Eastern. Much better than Pho Saigon 7 and less pretentious then Pho Saigon 9.  

Till next Tuesday Pho Saigon 8, when my parents will pay for my dinner again!!

So they raise their prices but the pho tastes like onion water. Onion water, people. We are probably still going to come back cause its the closest pho place to us and Annie pho gave us food poisoning.

Decided to use our mailer for the buy one get one free Delmonico steak for my husbands birthday dinner.  While the food was very good, the service needs some work.  I had ordered my steak with blue cheese and despite asking for it three times, it was never brought to me!  Our water glasses remained empty throughout our entire meal as well.  And, while they brought us a complimentary birthday cake, they never asked if we'd like coffee or an after dinner drink!  In addition, the table next to ours had to send their steak back as it was served rare and he had ordered it well done. I certainly hope service improves as its nice to have options.

Cheikh is by far the best in the transportation business.  We were staying at the planet Hollywood hotel, and wanted to pick up our family from Ohio (whom have never been to Vegas before) in style. We were taking to limo services when Cheikh THANKFULLY intercepted us. He was nearly the same price as a dinky 6 seater limo, but he was a HUGH, sound-system hooked up, music video synced party bus. He and his company we're the highlight of our company.

I use to go to this place every time I came to LasVegas but,I went there on March 29th,and got the Salt Pepper Lobster,and the waiter brought a parcel lobster and tried to pass it off as a whole lobster!
When I question him on the rest of the lobster,naturally he got upset because I caught him trying to scam us!
Needless to say we will not go back to this place again!

Normally the staff in there is so nice and always honor my coupons. Not today..I was  $0.69 away from the $40, and she would not honor my coupon...I wish I got her name..I only got the SM name, and his name is Mike...I'm very upset..I'll be making my way back there to return everything I bought, and I'll be shopping Walgreens from now on...

My hummus appetizer was huge and delicious. I wanted to eat all of it but it really is better for sharing. I love lamb so I had the 8oz lamb chops. Really good I wish there had been more. My potatoes were good but nothing to write home about. The rice was nicely spiced. The lamb was served with tzatziki which really added to the flavour. Nice atmosphere and beautiful outdoor patio. Service was friendly and quick.

It looks tiny from the outside but inside the burgers are big! The lamb burger was perfectly cooked and I had it with chipotle mayo, mustard, lettuce and tomato. The fries are skinny and really good. There are a wide variety of burgers including turkey, Kobe beef, grilled chicken, bison, as well as salmon and tilapia. Not in the mood for a burger? You can get a steak, fish and chips or several types of salad. Sides include fries, sweet potato fries or rings. The only downside was the table next to ours was very noisy and made it difficult to talk but the food more than made up for it. There is an outside patio and it looks like they are expanding.

I am not from the Toronto area and this is my first time here. We had lunch at Top Gun steak. All of their items are named for characters from the movie. I had the iceman, a steak burger with lettuce tomatoes roasted peppers and garlic mayo. The fries are homemade served with aioli sauce. Really delicious! The stores and booths are unique, vintage and full of exotic and local items. There is live music provided by corner musicians with homemade instruments. We didn't have time to see everything and plan to return soon! Definitely a must see when in Toronto!

I haven't been to Swiss Chalet in a while and was surprised by how the menu has changed! The 'usual' fare is near the back of the menu and some of the new items are Cheesy Bacon chicken Penne, Pesto chicken Penne, Chicken Parmesgan sandwich and perogies! I had the Pesto Penne and it had big chunks of chicken and it was delicious! my son had the cheesy bacon penne and really liked it! This particular restaurant was clean and not too busy. The service was fast and friendly. I was happy overall with our meals and will return again when I am in the Mississauga area!

They are allowing us to stay with him all day and have answered all of our questions honestly and patiently. Dr. Stephen Lewis his surgeon has gone out of his way to make my son's recovery as easy as possible. He visited my son on his day off! I was so thankful for that. It's still early in the process but we are extremely happy with the care we have been shown here. Wonderful hospital!

I loved the decor but my burrito was underwhelming. The chicken was nice but the refried beans and rice were just boring. Nothing to help it stand apart from other burritos.

We've stayed here twice because of it's location to Western Hospital. My son had an appt. there and the hotel is only a few minutes away. It is conveniently located close to restaurants and the subway. The rooms are nice and the beds comfortable. However, while we were there one of the main elevators stopped working and the phone in our room was not working either. The staff is very friendly and more than helpful. There is a Starbucks and bar in the lobby and a small snack shop with typical snack fare as well as any toiletries you may need. The rooms have coffee makers but no fridges. The TV was HD and offered a nice variety of channels. The hotel needs an update but for a short stay it is nice. Also has complimentary WIFI.

We were in Toronto for a show and went here for dinner. The veal marsala was amazing! It melted in my mouth. My son had the venison and it was also amazing good! We were disappointed they were out of the wild boar lasagna. I assume it's because it is also very good. The restaurant is very big inside and decorated like an old Italian piazza. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. Our water glasses were never empty. I love Italian and was blown away with the food here.

I moved from NYC to Toronto last year. I had the top EXTENTIONS "great lengths" done at a top Madison ave salon many times. I had no idea where to go when in Toronto so I called great lengths canada and asked who they would recommend. Deville was one of their favourites as well as a couple of other salons. So off I went with moderate expectations. WOW! Best EXTENTIONS I have ever had. Perfectly blended bonds so invisible not the least bit chunky. Can't rec'd this salon enough, oh and the prices are half that I was paying in NY yet another plus. Parking is free and in the rear couldn't be a more easy solution. This is now my hair "go to" in Toronto! Run don't walk!! And let me just say I'm a Yorkville girl who is VERY picky!!!

Friendly servers. Melt-in-your-mouth Tender cuts of beef to grill at your table. Prime Kalbi was so yummy. We ordered a combo that included a little of everything and added an order of prime Kalbi. Plenty of delicious food for 3 adults with moderate appetites. The portions aren't huge because of the amazing quality of meat they serve so if you have a lumber jack appetite, plan on spending a little more. Used a Groupon for the whole meal that would have cost around $50-$60 (not including drinks)
5 Stars for food
4 Stars for price (without the help of a Groupon of course)
And FYI to wheelchair-bound patrons, the seating is all booths. Unless you can transfer to the booth, don't plan on getting under the table. The design of the table doesnt allow a chair to pull in at the end. Plan on bringing a laptray to eat off of. A little inconvenient but so worth it.

I have been going to Shear Excellence for years.  I have to tell you the experience is awesome.  First, the decor is very tasteful and comfortable, not uptight. Second, they offer you a beer or drink when you arrive. Last but not least, the service is out of this world.  Stephanie is my stylist and I am amazed every time I walk out. I might be the hairiest man alive and somehow she makes me look like a gentlemen.  In fact, she has become a good friend who happens to cut my hair. Good people, straight up.

I have to say it's worth the wait.

I showed up and had to wait 20 mins. for breakfast on a Sunday (which really isnt bad).  OPH does a good job moving people in and out.

I had the corned beef hash and it was great.  I was very pleased to find out that it's homemade and NOT canned.  Needless to say the taste was out of this world.  There was so many choices I need to to keep going back.  Next on the list: crepes.

Wonderful place - excellent quality food and kind staff.

I agree with most of the other reviewers except for the comment about "The South."  I think that was flat out rude. 

Anyway, the Skyland restaurant will not blow you away.  The food is good, cheap and somewhat fast.  It's your typical diner, kind of weak coffee, overcooked sausage and thin white bread.  I typically get the Skyland Special.  Try the pancakes, I think they are perfect - not too fluffy and not too heavy.  

The atmospehere is eactly what any diner is - a bit loud if the the wrong people are there and eccelctic.  

Go there as an alternative to a chain breakfast restaurant and you will be happy.  Go there expecting crepes and you will not.

My group of four visited tonight for the first time.  I have to say it was just ok.  I love the concept and the atmosphere but the service was lacking.  To be more specific, it wasnt our waiter, he was great.  Insead, it was the kitchen staff and their mistakes.  First, we immediately got a table (yay) and we ordered our drinks and apps, the apps arrived before the drinks.  Ok, not that big of a deal but there was more.  Second, we ordered our meals and two of the four dishes arrived before the other two.  Both dishes were cold and the other  two did not arrive until the waiter noticed and had to go to the kitchen and start all over.  The food comes back and was incorrect and the cold meals originally delivered were simply reheated.  Have you ever had reheated duck?  I don't recommend it.

I love St. Francis.  The staff there is very friendly and kind.  Recently, my dog cut her eye open and I called several "Emergency" hospitals.  Not one hospital was willing to see my dog right away.  Instead, I called St. Francis (my usual vet) and they saw here right away and did surgery.  Also, I have found that they will beat any price found on petmeds.com or others on flea and tick medications.  Lastly, they are extremely reasonable and I have never questioned a bill or their methods.  

You will become a raving fan like me.

The Mad Greek will not wow you from the outside.  When you pull up you will undoubtedly think the place is going out of business.  However, they just opened up and the decor reminds you of an old diner.  I mean a really old diner.  

Enough of the aesthetics.  The food is good.  I had the gyro sandwich with fries.  The gyro was STACKED with meat and the veggies were fresh.  I must also say the pita was fresh and hot.  The tzatki sauce was good.  I prefer a little more garlic in my sauce but this was good regardless.  My wife had the Philly Cheesteak and it was great.  

Again, the decor is weird, the parking lot looks run down, but the food is good.  Try it - you will be surprised just as I was.

I gave it two stars because they try too hard and the flavors are forced.  By that I mean, I dont think the flavors are genuine.  

This was my first time to Copper.  Upon entering you are greeted by a very warm and friendly staff.  The decor is a not at all "modern" as some have described (I guess those people think modern is anything that's not painted beige).  I do agree seating is tight especially if you get a table in the corner by the windows.  The music is contemporary indian.  

The food was just ok.  I visited during restaurant week and there was a limited menu.  However, you are fee to order off the regular menu as well.  I ordered the cucumber avocado soup, the chicken, and the mango kulfi for dessert.  The avocado soup was not good.  I found it to be bland and the texture off.  The chicken was dry and needed more sauce to get by.  The mango kulfi was ridiculous and had deep flavor.  

If you are looking for a serious Indian restaurant - this is not the place for you.  If you are interested in trying something a little different and an enjoyable atmosphere go try Copper.

I agree with previous reviews, the place was a ghost town.  However, I never let that deter me from trying things out.  I must say I was a little skeptical at first - but now I am a fan.  

I had the miso soup, rice vegetable spring rolls and chicken and steak teriyaki with mixed vegetables.  First, the soup was flavorful and had a  little fire to it which I loved.  Second, the spring rolls were fresh with a nice assortment of fresh veggies that came with a sweet peanut sauce.  Lastly, the chicken and steak teeriyaki was great.  Many places you go (especially at this price point) will simply throw some veggies down and mix in the teriyaki sause.  Not here.  Instead, I found a great mix of broccoli, peppers, onions, mushrooms etc.  And yes, the mushrooms were big as another reviewer stated.  However, who complains that their mushrooms were too big?  The chicken was full plump pieces and the steak was just ok.  The rice was delicious and not doused in soy sauce.  The only drawback - I found things a little too salty.  

If you are looking to recreate your trip to Asia, this is not the place for you.  If you want fresh ingredients, nice flavor and decent prices - try WAM.

Just ok.

I waws there a few nights ago and had the spaghetti and meatballs.  My wife had the spinach pie.  It took a good while for someone to recognize we were there - but after that it was fine.  In fact, our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and had great descriptions of the meals.  However, the food was just ok - not to say he over promised, he didn't.  The food was just ordinary.  The meatballs were a little overcooked and the sauce was average.  I did try my wife's spinach pie and it was simply spankopita in huge portion.  

I recommend this place if you simply want a drink and an appetizer.  It's just average at best.

Mediocre food and lack of service ended with the waitress giving herself an 18% tip. While I have no issue with tipping I think:

1. They should try to earn the tip- she didn't. She brought one platter from the kitchen to the table and didn't even bother to refill out drinks as well as took 15 min to come back to collect my CC after she dumped the bill on the table. I asked if I could pay someone else and the staff told me no, I had to sit and wait for her to come back.

2. Because of the above, this was not a tip but a surcharge. The HD Cafe should warn that they charge 18% to have their servers bring you food.

Won't go back.

On top of that, the bathroom was filthy.

I have been hearing about this place on the radio for years but I live in the far west valley so it's a drive. Finally got there and couldn't get enough of the sweet BBQ sauce. Amazing on everything I had. The fried pickles were a bit too salty for my taste but the appetizer quesadilla was amazing! I could have had that for an entree. The green chili burrito was PACKED with meat and a definite get again. The combo meat sandwich was also an excellent base for more of that sweet BBQ sauce. I would go again with no hesitation, if ever on that side of town.

First time going and feel no urge for a return visit. It was 6:30 on a Friday night and they didn't seem busy but still took 25 minutes to give me my order as I waited alone in the lobby. 10 minutes of it was looking at my order sitting on the rack with the single employee playing on his phone. He eventually looked up and checked in with me even after he was the one who took my order and handed me the bag. I ordered the Italian beef, fries and cannelloni. The sandwich was not impressive and the fries over cooked. The cannelloni was however very good and the crust still crunchy.

He is the best of the best; he is very thorough and takes his time from the very beginning with the consultation down to the very end.

Went here off a suggestion from a family member. Definitely some of the best ice cream I've had. When I arrived there was only one worker behind the counter, a little frazzled but kept her cool despite the line forming. I ordered a scoop of Roasted Marshmallow and a scoop of Bailey's. The roasted marshmallow was delicious; it tasted like a campfire in the best way possible. I was a little disappointed in the Bailey's because I couldn't taste it, but the ice cream was still delicious. Definitely recommend checking this place out!

Service was great.  Dropped off on Friday and they were ready by Tuesday, I had two pairs of pants hemmed.  I don't often have things hemmed or taken in, so I don't know if they were a good price, but I think a little pricey.  $28 for two pairs.  Over all friendly and would return.

This place is a DUMP. I've stayed in holiday inn expresses that were nicer. Our room is like a dungeon. Also, the woman who checked us in laughed at our last name (it's a common Irish name. There is even a famous author with the same name).  We wanted to use the shuttle.  We had to call three times to finally get an answer and then person was beyond rude.  On the second day, they just never picked up the phone and we had to call a cab.  

We called and complained and they offered us a free night at the same hotel - why would I ever go back ???

Don't stay here under any circumstances.

Went here with a party of four last night, and we had a great time!  It wasn't where I expected to find it; sandwiched between a TJ Maxx and a Marshalls, but it lived up to the reviews.  Got there around 7:30 and told there was a twenty to thirty minute wait which was fine with me because I can always shop, but we were seated within ten minutes.  No one was super starving, so we skipped on appetizers.  Solid beer selection which pleased our group.  They also have alcoholic milkshakes.  One person ordered the granddad.  Holy booze - this shake was delicious, but there big and strong so be careful!!

BURGERs:  You can choose from organic, free range beef, bison, chicken breast or a veggie burger for all of the burgers.  I don't eat a lot of red meat, so when I go all in when I get a burger!  Two of us got the Monty; peppercorn rub, horseradish cheese with a Cabernet sauce and onions... SO GOOD.  Ordered medium rare and they were perfect.  Other side of the table did the custom burgers and they were extremely happy as well.  Burgers come with homemade potato chips, but you can also substitute fries and coleslaw too.  Chips were great, and the fries were good too (they had some kind of rosemary seasoning).  By the end of dinner, everyone's plate was empty.  Service was great too!

Bottom line: Check it out.

Went here for a nice dinner before a show. The bartender decided he knew girls better than we knew ourselves and insisted on making us fruity martinis rather than the dry martini we requested. Finally he agreed, and he made the two worst martinis ever. When we didn't drink them and ordered wine, he made fun of us for not liking our drinks.  He was the most annoying bartender I've ever experienced. Then our Red wine came in HOT milk glasses.  It was gross.  And the food? Mediocre is too generous of a description.

I have been to elements three times; the first time was excellent, the second time was good enough, and the third time was so awful I feel the need to ward off anyone else from visiting this restaurant.

We had two good experiences with elements, so when we saw a groupon for a four-course tasting menu, we bought it without hesitation.  Side note: our first excellent experience included the tasting menu. He ordered the four course, while I ordered a salad and entree.  His four courses were full of delicious food that was enough to feed us both.  Neither of us were able to finish our meals, and we left full and happy!  But tonight, our tasting menu options and delivery were beyond disappointing.

We decided to sit at the bar tonight.  When we sat down we were eyed down by the female bartender who reluctantly took our order.  She didn't bother to tell us the specials, which we later overheard her share with other customers, and she didn't ask if we were interested in any food.  Before we were finished with our drinks, she brought over our check; were we being rushed out of this NOT crowded bar?  I had a bad feeling, and I wish I would have trusted my gut to leave.  We asked her for another round and let her know we were going to order dinner and had a groupon.

Our service was bad before we told her we had a groupon, and it only spiraled down from there.  But bad service I can handle, it was the food that made me jump onto yelp!  The tasting menu was for family style service so we had to pick the same four items for dinner.  Family style?  This is different than last time, I thought.... Our first course was a variety of meats, cheeses, and olives.  It was a much smaller portion than he had during our first visit to elements, but who needs to over eat meat and cheese anyway?  The second course was a beat and goat cheese salad.  The salad was large and more than enough for two people (aka filler).  When our entree arrived I almost fell off of my barstool.  There was one filet of salmon for the two of us to share.  It wasn't a monstrous sized salmon as big as my head, it wasn't two of my fists, it was a small piece of salmon meant to feed both of us.  I am mortified that I didn't call attention to this at the restaurant, but I couldn't believe that I had been served a 'family style' portion of salmon that included only one piece of fish.  WHAT?  Dessert wasn't memorable, but what I do remember is not being asked if I wanted coffee to accompany it either.

I'm not even mentioning in detail the bartender's awkward comments that we cleaned our plates during our meal or that another bartender knocked over my glass of wine. Please, don't go to elements.  There are too many better restaurants in Pittsburgh to waste anymore thought on this dump.


Note to restaurants: If you don't like people who use groupons, then please don't invite us into your restaurant only to treat us poorly. Like I said earlier, this was our third visit to Elements.  We bought the groupon because we were repeat customers, we liked the restaurant, and now we will never go back.

**UPDATE**
I followed up with Groupon and Elements.  Groupon refunded our money with no problem at all.  When I called Elements, they said the owner wanted to speak to me after reading my review on yelp, but he wasn't available.  He called me back once, and I returned the call.  I haven't heard back anything.

Yes! This is a fantastic bar! Our bartender was awesome & very knowledgeable about beer, the food was good, and they have a great variety of beer. Very nice, relaxed setting. If you're debating where to go, go here.


... Since my first review I've been back twice.  Both times the services was really really bad.  This makes me sad, but I've crossed them off my list; service is too hit or miss.

I almost feel bad giving Dean's such a bad review because they try to be a nice salon, but it just isn't.  They're great with coupons; you'll almost never pay full price for a haircut.  This explains why I got my haircut there so many times.  Each visit was more bizarre than the time before.  The last time that I went to Dean's, two of the stylists lectured me on the 'bad' product that I used on my hair (a bumble and bumble product...).  

Overall, my haircuts were never good.  Mehh at best.  I've been to three different stylists there and only one of them spoke to me while cutting my hair.  That can be an awkward hour long hair cut... And the salon is dirty.  Maybe my standards are too high, but if I'm getting my eyebrows waxed, I believe that the hair should be wiped off of the chair.  Or that there shouldn't be noticeable dust bunnies all over the salon.  There are just so many better salons in Pittsburgh (MCN), please don't waste your money here.

Burritos and quesadillas were fantastic. Chicken was perfectly cooked. Agree with others that the guacamole was not the best, although not horrible either. Staff was very friendly.  They also deliver in the area with a $15 minimum which is an added bonus if you live nearby.

If you haven't tried Coach's yet, you're missing out. Great casual atmosphere, lots of beer, great specials, and the food is REALLY good. The nachos are amazing. They use pita chips (a spin on traditional bar nachos) and you can get beef, chicken, or pork on top. They also serve different flavors of fries such as cajun, garlic, and sweet potato. All are really yummy! Save room for dessert because they have a trained pastry chef & he doesn't disappoint. 

Haven't tried it yet, but they're adding brunch on the weekends; I'll certainly be checking that out soon

I'm from the Bay Area, CA where there are just several coffee shops that value crafting coffee actually well. But it seems the bay is actually one of the top places to more likely find such coffee shops, where a cappuccino is actually a cappuccino.

So here's this awesome spot in Las Vegas I've personally found, the first so far in this city.  It was worth walking past a few Starbucks shops on the way here! It is literally written on their walls how they value making coffee right here (there's cool chalk drawings of the differences between different types of orders, TVs showing the farming process, etc). 

The shop is really clean and rather spacious. It's a nice place to even study, have a conversation, or just meet, with outdoor seating as well if you really wanna. It's currently nicely air conditioned indoors, well furnished with tables, and for the jusr 3 times I've been around they've played a nice variety of music.

After all I've said about crafting a cup of coffee well, I'll say it was amusing watching another customer complain outloud, asking what was going on today, and how her "furtado isn't even hot enough" ^_^ ... What is to note though is how they handled it. They were generous enough to make another one, and just maintained courteous service pretty much. Besides that they've just been the nicest people so far, nice to talk to.

Bonus support: Bruxie is pretty close by, if you want a more filling waffle & chicken meal first. Mmm.

I rented a Triumph Tiger for 5 days from this dealership. The bike performed flawlessly for the entire trip. The bike was ready for me when I arrived early. Everything was explained carefully and the guys at the dealership were very accommodating. Dylllan in particular was very helpful. The whole rental experience was seamless and I would rent from them again in a heart beat. Planning next years trip now, in fact.

If it wasn't for the Groupon I had purchased I would have walked out the door before I sat down.  

They sell pizza out the back door but refuse to serve it in their restaurant. When asked to be served the pizza I was told by the owner that "it wasn't a pizza parlor". So rather than serve me what I wanted I ate an overpriced and bland meal. 

My advice: Spend your money at a restaurant that will accommodate your needs.

Stay away from this place!   This place been recommended me by the Costco.  brought my professional loops to repair the frame arm , they fix the arm but broke the glass in the frame.   My loops cost 1600$    They offer to repair and repaired was poorly made.  I ask them sent it to the company who made the loops.  They refused.  Gloria the receptionist and the owner was sweet in the beginning until they made mistake and then She became  rude !!! and unprofessional     Once again due to neglect and poor skills of the repair guy I would not recommend this place     75$ repair cost a lot of stress and now I have to spend thousand dollars to get new glasses.

Pros:
+  Pet friendlly (we did our homework and found only 4 other hotels near the strip that allow dogs, 2 are extremely expensive).
+  Huge suites!!  Ours was 1,000+ s.f.
+  Heated indoor/outdoor swimming pool & lounge area (the pool was so warm even though it was xmas time) and open long hours (8am to 11pm)
+  Kitchen - very convenient, full size fridge, range, and dishwasher (they even have dish washing liquids, just bring your own sponge)
+  Washer/dryer in the bigger suite
+  Free internet!!  Although their website says you need to pay, at check-in we asked them if they had free internet and they gave us the complimentary login and password.  awesomeness!
+  Big bathroom
+  Non-smoking, non-casino hotel, very peaceful
+  Only about 10 mins. walk to the center of the strip, faster than driving!

Cons:
-  Dusty!  Not sure if it's all of Vegas but I had never noticed so much dust in my room at other hotels before.  
-  Valet parking: kinda inconvenient when you need to get something from your car
-  Sofabed is extremely flimsy, if you have more than 2 people, insist on 2 queen beds.  the sofa cushions are much more comfortable.

Other points:
*  Should call ahead of time to make sure your room have the # of beds you requested when you booked.  (We didn't get our 2 queen beds although we checked in at 2pm.  They were nice enough to switch us to a slightly bigger suite with washer/dryer.)
*  Hotel lobby is extremely small!
*  In-room food service was overpriced (and food was only so-so).  Ask the front desk for a nearby delivery restaurant.  We ordered from there our 2nd night and got a ton of food for 1/2 the price we paid room service!
*  Don't go to the 7-11, it's shady.  You can shop at the am/pm or the Shell food mart across the street.

Overall, it was a good experience for the price we paid ($98).  I would definitely return to this hotel.  I give it a 4.5 stars.

A spontaneous trip to Metro Diner. My partner and I wanted pancakes so she yelped what was closest to us and this place came up. 
The place has seating capacity of 91 so it's pretty big for a local breakfast joint. They also have seating outside. 
I ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs and my partner ordered Yo Hala on the square. My dish was good but I've had better. The Yo Hala is a different story, it was my first time trying something like it so I didn't have anything to compare it to. All I know is it was the bomb!!! 
Jessica was our server and she was very attentive. We will definitely go back and try other stuff.

First time customer here. Rented a car with no reservations and it was a breeze. Ms. Fujiama was very helpful and straightforward. I had a reservation with Payless but when I got to there, Payless had a very long line. Although it was expected since Payless was the cheapest you can get online. So I decided to just try to get a quote from Advantage right there and then and got a cheaper deal. Was upgraded to a Rav4 as well. Their vehicles are recent models. Great car rental experience. Will definitely use the company again. Every rental company is different. Advantage will require you to provide the following: Valid Driver's license of course, Credit card, and a proof of car insurance(even if you're buying their insurance). I don't know if you can rent from them if you don't have a car insurance. They never asked for utility bills though like other rental companies do.

I was in awe how clean their cutting board was! lol. This place will make you feel like you're not in Vegas. The food made me reminisce that time when I was at the night market in Kowloon! A place I definitely will frequent more often. I tried the BBQ duck with rice and washed it down with a Thai tea. I will recommend both! CLEANEST Asian restaurant I've been to!!! You gotta try it just for that reason!

Wonderful place tucked away on Adelaide West, seems small when you enter, but has some great space in the back to relax. It has a very cozy feel to it and is well decorated, ideal for a relax working spot. Although it was a bit warm when I was here.

Half coffee shop, half kitchen/house store. You only get one selection of coffee (columbian). Unfortunately, the Batista wasn't very knowledgeable and wasn't able to tell me if if the beans were from a single origin. Espresso was good, not outstanding.

Hands down the best seafood I've had in Toronto, and I've grown on the Mediterranean with an abundance of freshly caught seafood. Seafood is cooked very simply, the way it's supposed to be (no fancy dressings, etc.)
Decoration is funky, and adds a fun touch to the experience. Apparently, the owner's dad was the artist that brought "the breast" to Toronto (the women's breast that is). Check it out!

My husband and I found this business at the Arizona home show.  The owner was very nice and the company was licensed and bonded so we thought we were in good hands.  We had the owner come and look at our brand new home and give us an estimate of painting the inside of our home.  The price was reasonable and being that we found this company at the home show and because the company was licensed and bonded we hired them to do the job.  We were told the job would take 4 days and we checked on the progress every day.  Again this is our brand new never lived in home, on the last day of painting we checked on the progress only to find the painting was completed along with major damage to our brand new shower.  The owner did not call us when the damage occured and when we contacted him he fessed up and apologized that one of his workers had fallen off a ladder and broke an entire slab of stone in our shower and promised to take care of the damage.  When we asked why we were not told when it happened the owner said he was trying to come up with a solution first.  Seemed odd to us we werent told immediately but let it go.  We then had to get the original stone installers to our new home for an estimate and provided the estimate to the painter.  The owner of the company did send us a check for the difference of what we owed him and the damage to our stone which is still not yet fixed as it had to be ordered so we have been without a shower now for over two weeks.

We thought this would all be behind us and that it was just an unfortunate accident that wasnt handled very well.  That was until we found further damage to the outside of our home.  It was obvious more damage was done by the companies workers!  They had dragged a pallet of paint from our gate to our back door in our backyard.  The pallet was left in our backyard and we were able to trace the lines the pallet made all the way to its last ending point.  Based on the tracks it appears the workers pushed the pallet around the corner of our house and pulled so hard it removed the stucco and paint from the side of our BRAND NEW house.  

I was never advised of this damage either and when we emailed the owner of the company we never received a response.  We are beyond dissatisfied with this company based on the damage they did to our home not once, but twice and how it was handled.  We have never written a review on a company before and have never been so dissatisfied and wanted to warn others of our experience with this company.  Our suggestion although the price may be reasonable choose another company for any painting needs BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY!

Quite possibly the worst food I've ever eaten in my entire life. Literally. We ordered the chili beef, garlic chicken, and masala noodles. The chili beef was just spicy. It had absolutely no flavour. The garlic chicken was too sweet. And the masala noodles were the most horrific food I have probably ever eaten. They were extremely dry and there was so much "masala" powder on them that brining the fork two inches from my lips caused me to gag. If you're near Markham and Steeles and are craving Hakka food, make the drive up to 14th and eat at Fredericks!.

Spiffy place, definitely a social setting. I enjoyed the concept of the bar not to mention the staff especially Taylar who was extremely helpful and informative. Taylar made the experience amazing keeping a smile on her face throughout the entire time. I do think the drinks could be a little stronger, I could barely taste the alcohol. Overall it was a cool experience.

Not great but just ok.  Backed oysters were above average but the yellowfin tuna was unremarkable.  New York steak was not as tender as it should have been.  I think they did not serve Choice cuts.

If you have been to Morton's and other pretentious steakhouses, you are in for a treat.  This place is very retro steakhouse, almost corny.  I love it. Steaks are great salads are build you own with ingredients delivered to the table.  The outside looks like a windowless bar but the inside is warm and inviting.  Is that Bogart in the corner with a martini?

We came here for a full dinner but left after our drinks so this review does not grade the steak but the lackluster service. 

From the moment you walk in, you are (or should be) tempted to leave. The "hostess" doesn't smile or greet you, but hastily takes you to a table. Then the waitress comes with the same attitude and lack of knowledge of the food, wine or beer. She couldn't answer even what beers they had or what was different about them. After saying we were ready to place our order she disappeared. After a long duration she returned, at which time we decided we had enough. 

I may give Longhorn another try, but not at this location.

The atmosphere is pleasant in that it feels rather cozy and the servers are extremely good here. 

However, the letdown for me is the food itself. 

The filet mignon I ordered looked like it was pan fried and it was the thinnest filet I have ever seen. It was a good cut, though being nice and lean and cooked as requested. 

But... I couldn't taste the steak. All I could taste was their salt / seasoning salt. It was completely overbearing. I also ordered a baked potato with nothing on it and steamed broccoli. Well, you guessed it, all it tasted of was salt. I drank so much water afterwards trying to get rid of the salty taste but it just didn't work. Honestly, it was a terrible feeling for what could have been a good meal with pleasant service.

We were staying at the Camelback for Christmas and decided to go to BLT for Christmas Dinner as they had a special menu. We could not have been more disappointed. 

The initial toasted bread and pate was very good and all seemed promising. But this was then followed by a salty greasy puffy bread. 

The snails and the salad was quite good if almost too large as the salad was absolutely huge, but that's not really a negative. 

Then came the moment of truth - turkey dinner. It was dry, small, and mine had lots of skin and cartilage in one of the slices. Very unpleasant. Plus, the sides were very unorthodox. A chicken pot pie with gravy and dark meat. Not good. The brussel sprouts - a $10 side - were cooked with bacon and ham and all you could taste was salt and smoke. The sweet potato - another $10 side - was blended with marshmallow on top. Yes - marshmallow. We tried digging for the sweet potato but we couldn't find it beneath the marshmallow. 

The service wasn't bad, but the food lacked any subtle flavors and everything was overdone.

There are much better choices out there as we discovered during the rest of our stay.

Went on a weeknight and was treated to great service and delicious food.

tiny and really packed, but we were served quickly. the margaritas were great with not too much tequila, and the fish tacos were awesome! fresh and filling considering there were only two and they were quite small.

Sushi was nice, fresh fish of a good quality, but, a bit pricey and the service was a little hit and miss. Took about 20 minutes to bring our drinks which was rather long when we calculated about one server for every table ! All in all though, perfectly fine for a quick meal if you are near by, but I wouldn't go out of your way.

The place was fully booked and we didn't make reservations, so we sat at the full service bar. The bar tender Annahita, took wonderful care of us! Drinks were creative and paired well with the food, and holy crap the food! I recommend the tuna tataki as a small plate and the 49th state roll. By far some of the most creative and tasty sushi we've had in a while!

This location has great service and as always the food is great. The only thing is the play area. I have been here on so many different occasions that I'm disappointed to have to say that time and time again the play equipment is disgusting. The room always has a nasty urine odor to it. But it's the actual climbing equipment that has made me not allow my kids to come and play anymore. Every time they start climbing their hands, knees and feet end up black from grime. The slide is so gross and sticky you can't even slide down it. I'm not sure what the cleaning requirements are for these types of areas but something desperately needs to be reevaluated and fixed. I understand that lots of kids play throughout the day, but it is just unacceptable to have such a filthy play area.  
I hope they can get higher standards of cleanliness established as soon as possible.

My husband I and both have been seeing Alisha for four months and I cannot say enough great things about her as a stylist and colorist. She is meticulous and thorough. Every hair cut has been fantastic. And her skills at doing color are better than any I've ever had. She always checks the costs before you have any services done, and I feel the prices are very fair for what you get. I'm a Chicagoan so I've had many many extremely expensive hair services done in the past and Modern Salon is less expensive than what I've had before and offers better service as well. 
Everyone is very friendly, polite and goes out of their way to assist you. I would recommend Modern Salon to anyone but mostly I would say book with Alisha. She is such a great stylist and a wonderfully warm person as well.

I want to rate this company as a negative 5 star company. I don't have the energy to  write a detailed review because for the last year and a half, my energy has gone into playing phone tag and  complaining about  the lack of service from my usual tech. The day I received my keys for my house a year and a half ago, I checked out the condition of the pool. The pool was clean but the vacuum was very slow. I called to let them know it's not working properly an was told that I need to turn it on.  That was their attitude towards the situation. My reason for calling that day was to avoid what actually ended up happening....which is a pump replacement. For the last year and a half I have been calling to say that, basically, the pool is constantly dirty and green because it's not working and have asked if someone can check it out. Usually, my request is ignored. If, somehow magical forces collided, and the tech actually does take a look, I have been told that the issue is an o-ring replacement or a diaphragm replacement.  I have paid for parts multiple times but I am not sure if the parts were actually replaced because the issues continued. Again, my concerns were ignored until just recently they told me I need a new pump. I am irritated because they are sayin I let the pool get too dirty and that's why the pump has gone out. I  have tried to complain about the tech letting the pool stay green during the winter months but nothing was done about it. Their response was that the tech never mentioned anything about it. Of course not! He would be snitching on himself for not doing anything about it. They tried to tell me that the pump went out because I never had the cleaning service done. I never did because why would I have them brush the steps and tile when I do that myself and I do not trust them enough to take care of the other comps ta of their cleaning service because they rob me already by not doin anything when they see the pool needs to be backwashed and when the pool is green. Plus, they never said the cleaning service is needed for the pool to function properly. They were only trying to up sell this service. 

Also, this company will try to sell a service to lower yor calcium level. Don't fall for it. They will call and email you about it...DO NOT fall for it. Many pool companies try to sell this service but it's bullshit. My bottom of my pool contained a lot of dirt because the vacuum wasn't working and it was green for months but the tech never took the initiative to fix it but yet I'm getting calls AND emails about my calcium levels. Really? The tech will report that but NOT a green pool? I do t think so.
Plus, while speaking with an overly defensive customer service representative today, this individual read through all of the notes and NOT ONCE did he mention the calcium levels were high. That's because it's all fake.

The only reason why I am a customer is because of the salt pump.

Wow! The employees and owner all live up to the name and their mission. The owner came by to check out my situation the next day after I contacted Honest Pool Care. He was very eager to check it out, as he was concerned about the problem becoming worse if we waited too long. He was very thorough during his visit. He wasn't there for the full hour. Therefore, he had no interest in charging me for the full hour visit. He gladly reduced the price for me. Awesome! He could have very easily charged me full price as he was there for more than 30 minutes. He told me what he thinks might be the root of the issue but stressed he would talk it over with some repair techs to be sure and to avoid unnecessary costs and repairs. After discussing with his crew, he called me to inform me of their findings the following day. I love that this company is on top of things! Regretfully, I was a former Poolman customer. Dealing with that company is like pulling teeth. It takes a week just to talk about an issue with that awful company.  He was honest and told me what he had initially thought was the issue, no longer seems to be an issue at all. He explained to me what was going on and offered me options to fix this problem.  I appreciate that as well because he could have easily taken advantage and  only offer one solution...one where his company would profit. Experiencing this level of great customer service helps to ease my nervous attitude toward this situation. Also, I must note that I live in South Phoenix. I called multiple pool companies that claim they service Phoenix and surrounding areas. However, none of them were willing to come this far south. Honest Pool Care, according to this site, services Tempe and surrounding areas. This company is willing to come to this area. Also, they could use horrible business tactics and "tax me" in a way for the drive but, thankfully, they did not. I absolutely love this company.

I was happy to see that  this mall has this restaurant because it is one of my favorite places to eat. I usually go to the Promenade location....and very happy there but Vaughn Mills its a totally differrnt story....
I am walking in with   my husband and two kids. Right at the front they tell me i have to leave my stroller behind...are you kidding me... no restaurant has ever ask me to do that before...what if one of my kids was sleeping? i actually  try to time it that way so i can eat a meal in peace.

Since we were all hungry i figured ok lets just stay in.I asked for a booth because it is easier to manage my 3 yr old in there.The waitress gave me a weird look and said that a booth is not available and we can  sit at a regular tabe...why...i do not know...the restaurant wasn't even that busy

.ok so i am getting pretty irritaded by now...i insisted of getting that booth...she gave it to us but with an attitude. I figured it can not get any worst than this lets just enjoy our meal.

As i am getting the menu i ask for the high chair...the waitress tells me she can not give me the high chair because we are sitting in a booth...what?!..i always get a high chair sitting in a booth and it is never a problem and maybe if you didn't take my stroller away i would be able to put my younger child in there.

At this point i asked for a  manager. She tells me how it is dangerous for my son to sit there because it is blocking the waitress to serve the food to our table  and the food is hot...and they are concerned about safety...believe me there was more than enough space 


I was quite upset at this point so she brings me a high chair...the one that you are supposed to strap in to a chair...hello...i can not strap this to anything we are sitting in a booth...am i supposed to sit my 1 yr old child in a high chair that is not straped in into anything...i think that it is pretty dangerous!

Don't ask why but we stayed anyway with me and my child sitting on my lap.

BUT I TOLD MYSELF I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN ...EVER!

It is a waste of a good restaurant...poor management!

I would highly recommend the Promenade location. They have very friendly stuff...stroller no problem...you can sit whetever you like...with a proper high chair...really i have nothing bad to say except that.i am always very pleased with their service and of course that they have yummy yummy food at a reasonable price.

Had the Thanksgiving turkey burger. Burger didn't taste fresh. In fact, the burger came out in record time which further makes me believe it wasn't fresh. There was very little sauce and stuffing in the burger. The sweet potato tots weren't cooked thoroughly either. In conclusion, there are better options in the city for the price point that Wahlburgers is in.

My boyfriend and I are visiting Scottsdale from NJ and we just happened upon BQ one afternoon while exploring.  What drew us in was the sign outside announcing their $3 tacos and $3 margaritas during happy hour.  This was a great find.  We had a few tacos, 2 of which were the happy hour special that day and one extra -- one was salmon & mango which my bf said was amazing, another had cactus in it, and mine was pulled pork if I remember correctly.  Both the food and margs were amazing.  The bartenders were extremely friendly, one even gave us a bunch of recommendations of bars to check out while we were in town.  The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars from me is because it closes so early.  It seems like so many restaurants in this area close by like 9 or 10pm, which is crazy to me because Im used to not even going out to dinner until 830 or 9pm.  Regardless, we're going to try and stop in again before we leave.

We got a great deal at Bally's for a totally adequate room.  After quickly losing $40 (I'm a big gambler ;-) on their slots we went to Ellis for the BBQ dinner.  Told the wait would be 1 1/2 hours we got called in about 45 minutes.  Chicken and ribs were very good.  Wife did not like the beans which were watery (but I thought tasty).  We were given plastic fork, knife & spoon which made eating difficult.  (Try slicing meat with a plastic knife.)  Corn was pretty bad.

We ended up going back there for 2 breakfasts (mid-week BTW) and had no trouble getting in.  My wife was very happy with hers.   I had omelets both times and 1st was good and 2nd was passable.  Good toast (no small thing) and breakfast potatoes.

We did play slots there quite a bit.  My wife ended up breaking even (including losses at the big casinos) and I didn't lose too much with several hours of play.

Ellis is a 1 (Vegas) block walk from Bally's by a less than delightful fenced off, abandoned parking lot.  A couple of street people (junkies?) seem to sit out by the 7-11, but no trouble.  My wife was glad I was with her.

Not really busy while we were there so smoke was not a problem, but it's one thing I hate about casinos.  I wonder why non-smokers have so few (or no) options?  Do smokers lose more???

We only went there during the day.  If I went at night I would want to drive.

I am something of a burger connoisseur and these burgers are AMAZING! My husband and I eat here for $13 total and we are always super satisfied. The owners take pride in making everything fresh and presentable, and the care that goes into their cooking can't be beat. I do not understand why people complain about the wait or ambiance and let that negatively affect the score- it's the FOOD that matters, and the food is incredible for the price.

I was finally able to try Du-Par's and their "famous" pancakes. Well, they were good but not as amazing as I was hoping they would be.  I ordered a short stack which was still too much to finish. I am glad I tried them but am certainly in no rush to go back.

Spent 15 minutes arguing with the woman who did my intake paperwork about whether insurance for domestic partners "is legal" in the state of Arizona.  She came just short of accusing me of insurance fraud.  I finally had to insist she call the insurance provider and confirm my coverage.  What a narrow-minded, unprofessional office.

I had a mixed experience with this company. I am currently 29 weeks pregnant.  We hired them to pack and move me out of a 3-bedroom rental into our new place. In part, I blame myself for contracting with the on nothing more than an email quoting an hourly rate for packing and the move. If they quote you an hourly rate, I _highly_ recommend getting them to commit to a maximum time-frame for your project and have them provide a price list for any packing materials to be used.

The two men I had for the packing were courteous and relatively efficient. I was shocked, however, at what we ended up being charged for boxes and packing material. Especially, when asked, they could not provide us any sort of itemization for what was used. 

The next day for the move, we had one of the same people and a new person who seemed to be about 20 with very little experience moving. Again, they were courteous and very careful in the handling of our furniture. But they were the slowest movers I've ever used. 

It took just short of eight hours for them to move a three-bedroom house. There was a great deal of chatting between the two movers and hanging out in the truck. The "greener" of the two movers also frequently hovered around seeming uncertain of what needed to be done next.  I was literally standing over them in the 110 degree heat by the end of it trying to get them to finish. It then took them close to another hour to get hold of the main office and try to figure out the paperwork. 

We had planned to also use this company for my partner's move in two weeks but, based on our experience, we will be using another company.

Have driven past this place for over a year and finally made my first visit today! Cutest little cafe. The front of the cafe is quaint and cozy, boosting some lovely kitchen & misc house ware items for sale. As you make you're way through the cafe there is another area showcasing various items and then additional small tables in a semi-private room. I can see it being a really good spot for meeting a study group or something of that nature. The menu is small, with the focus on speciality lattes. I indulged in a Nutella latte and it was delicious. I think I'll try the toasted almond latte next! I also grabbed a peanut butter cookie and it was the perfect amount of soft and crunchy. I'm glad I finally got to check this place out and look forward to my next visit :)

Where do I begin? Custom poutine has never looked so good. I opted for a regular sized poutine of the vegetarian variety, with tomatoes, roasted red pepper, goat cheese, sour cream and of course gravy. It was a little soupier than I had anticipated, but I can only blame myself for choosing so many sauces/cheeses. I just couldn't pass any of those up nor do I regret my decision. My boyfriend got a large poutine, which was basically enough to feed a family of four. And he topped his with gravy, sauteed onions, mushrooms and chicken. We were unable to finish his so we packed it up and enjoyed the rest later that night. And it was delicious! I should also note that the service at this location was impeccable, my boyfriend forgot to check off which gravy he wanted, he left that box blank, so when they brought us our dishes they also brought a soup bowl full of gravy for him, just in case, without us even asking. I just thought that was really intuitive and great customer service! All in all, I will definitely go back to this location next time I'm in Montreal.

It is unfortunate that a pet insurance company has chosen to deceive pet owners.  Read the fine print.  They take your premiums (not clarify what is not covered, auto-renew) but do not pay the claims.  I am not sure what other pet insurers do, but the industry seems like a scam as for $600 for a healthy pet, one would be better off putting it into a savings account.

Justin Philipp was the only dentist out of 5 dentists I saw said that I needed crowns because I had cracks (which I found out that I didn't have cracks). He didn't even show me where I had cracks. It took 6 hours to prep my teeth for 3 crowns because he had to see 10 other patients at the same time. He didn't bother to explain what he is about to do or what he is doing or how much of tooth structure will be drilled away. Almost all the work was done by his incompetent assistant who kept dropping the temporaries on the floor and didn't even bother to clean up and said that she couldn't tell which temporary goes to which teeth since they look the same! The only thing this dentist did was 'drill' and didn't put the thread around the prepped teeth or temporaries.
I had a lot of pain with the temporaries but the dentist couldn't be bothered. Instead of figuring out what's happening, they hurried to put the permanent crowns on without asking me if I am satisfied with them. I had TMJ for a month along with other pain but the dentist was ready to send me to the Endodontist when it was a bite issue. I asked him to take an xray to verify the post work but he refused. So I went to see another dentist and found out that these crowns have 'OVERHANGS' and he graded this work as a 'C'. This will lead to tooth decay and bone loss. 
I really wish I hadn't gone to see him. I went to see him because he was on TV and awarded on the magazine which I found out that you can pay them to be on. He over treated my teeth that didn't need any treatment and went to extreme measure (crowns). Now I lost all the good healthy teeth because this dentist was greedy, don't care about patients' health, and incompetent!

The closest good sushi you'll find downtown. I've been going to Ichi Ban for a couple of years and have to say that its the best sushi you can find in downtown. They have a lot of specialty rolls such as the phoenix suns roll, spicy Tuna with unagi on the top with dressing. Pretty tasty. Their sashimi is fresh and made to order. The only bad thing about this restaurant is when your eating and it's not busy, they seem to be spying on you and makes it a lil uncomfortable for  you peeps that can't stand that the staff is looking at your every move. For me, I just want goo sushi and this place definitely hits the spot.

I'm typically a very patient guy and don't like to bash any business but since I'm still stuck here, I might as well make my time useful. Do NOT, and I mean DO NOT come here for an oil change or any service. As soon as I pulled my truck in, I noticed two gentlemen sitting in their stalls doing paperwork. Both just sort of looked at me like a lost little child or soul, trying to find their parents and without the tendency to come out and just say we will be with you shortly. So I waited 10 minutes and just as soon as I was about to hope back in my truck and drive off, a gentlemen comes out and asks me sorry about the wait but what can I do for you. ? I want an oil change how long please? About 1-1.5 hours. Okay long story short, there were others in the waiting area bitching and nagging about the super long wait and Never again will they come here.  After about a 99.5 minute wait I go outside and ask my advisor, do you know how long until my car is ready. It's been over 1.5 hours? Let me check... Waited another 15 mins till my 100% charged IPhone had about 20% left . Finally went back outside and this time I walked into the auto area and saw my truck just sitting there. I go and let him know what's my truck doing there?  Looking puzzled, he goes to the back yells out a name and said bring the truck up! Then he looks at me and said I guess you don't have time for the free car wash eh? Paid and left.  That's how my experience went.  You've been warned

Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli is one of my favorite places to eat. I use to go a lot back then, when the owner Alex somehow disappearred to the Middle East ( maybe finally getting married ).  They use to stack their portions with a lot of meat. Since new ownership, they are cut back on the protons but the food is awesome as usual. Their mix grill and chicken kabobs are a must try. With the aromatic smell of their rice along with a side salad with greek dressing, it compliments the meat very well. Their homemade lemonade was very tasty and the owner is very nice along with his staff. Kinda like home cooking except when they get super busy, be prepared to wait awhile, but well worth it.

Just had lunch at Thai Hut with my fellow co worker who insisted on trying a new place. Got to Thai Hut, menu was pretty simple to choose from.  We got our food pretty quick.  I had the yellow curry chicken. It was mediocre at best. My colleague's Beef panang tasted pretty bland. Chicken was prepared probably in advance as it was not as hot as we had hoped. Prices for downtown is reasonable and the service is fast.

We stayed for one night. It is a standard older hotel that has been updated. Rooms are still small but modern. Staff are friendly and helpful. We stayed in a room by the elevator and ice machine. So it was not the best room. All night we heard a knocking in the wall. We think it is a loose water pipe. It was weird, it sounded like someone knocking on our door. Overall it is a nice clean place,nothing special.

I expect more from a chain restaurant. The hostess was chomping gum and seemed annoyed that she had to stop texting when she had to seat us. About an hour before close the servers were sweeping up the peanuts and moving tables. We all felt rushed. It didn't help that the beer was warm. Problem from restocking and not rotating. We won't be back.

we used to live in western Virginia with the nearest comedy club being Improv in DC and overall enjoy the comics here just as much as we did in DC.  Plus the costs at Madison's is much cheaper and the food better!    The venue at Madisons is a little different sort of like comedy in a long trailer but then the DC Improv would stuff people in like sardines so for us no problem.  Anyway we love it especially from what we had in Virginia

This company is straight garbage. We rented the 3 Rivers Party Bus for the Luke Bryan concert July 22nd. The problems were as follows:

1. They showed up late to pick us up. Not just a couple minutes late, but 30 or so minutes, which then led them to be late for the two other stops.
2. Half of the amenities that came with the bus, just weren't any good/didn't work.
   a. Speakers didn't work
   b. TV didn't work
   c. Poles in the middle were rusted
   d. Bus in general was just dirty
3. Driver wasn't pleasant at all. He was ignorant to some of the people on the bus. He also was talking poorly about our group because we weren't feeding him (We would have, if he wasn't ignorant to our group)
4. On the way home, we were going so fast, that when the driver hit a bump on the road, we would fly out of our seats. This might be ok for some, but not us.
5. Finally, they charged my friends Aunt an extra $400 just recently. 

In conclusion, I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. If you are looking for a good Limousine company stay clear of this one.

I have been to Udupi Madras Cafe multiple times and the variety of DOSA'S there is incredible. I love the mysore masala dosa, Chettinadu Masala Dosa, the delicious chili paneer masala dosa and the list goes on. The desserts are equally great. Dont forget to try the Udupi Special GADBAD Ice Cream, its one thing you cannot miss if you go to udupi. On saturday and sunday, it even has an awesome BREAKFAST BUFFET with variety of chutneys, south indian delicacies like vada, idli, Upma,Pongal, sheera etc.  The prices are very reasonable, the staff is friendly and overall ambiance is great. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine. It's one place that really reminds me of my native place and the culture of India.

I wasn't expecting much as far as food. They did however serve me the best chicken wings I have ever had period. I enjoyed the cuban but I am docking the star from review bc I wish bartender told me how amazing they were.  I had to hear from the guy sitting next to me on the bar. He said I should have got wings for app and entree. They should pull the chicken off the wings and make a chicken melt or salad sandwich. I'm telling you they are the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!( all the way to end exclamation marks)

Very poor.

No exhaust in the bathroom. As you probably know Vegas gets really hot, so this can be a major discomfort when steam builds up from your shower.

I broke out in rash (i thought it was bed bugs). I stay in hotels all the time, never had this experience before.

I was told I would get call from GM, never did.

Several staff members rude and unhelpful.

They wanted to charge me $17.99 per day for internet access. You could not get internet access in either of the 2 Starbucks on site. I strongly suspect that is because the hotel would not allow them. Even my 3G phone had very slow download.

I had 2 small packages delivered to my hotel. They charged me $21 to accept delivery of them, in other hotels I have stayed in that was a free service. I really got the feeling they wanted to squeeze every last dime they could out of you.

I would not recommend to anyone under any circumstances.

We came for my nephew's recent marriage. The place was very packed as it's apparently the popular place during spring training. Hubby ordered steak. It seemed like a blackened piece of char but he tried it. He said it was hard to describe, but the absolute worst steak he's ever had. This place needs a new chef or something. The steak doesn't come with a baked potato, but it came with cut up carrots and corn on the cob. The carrots didn't look appetizing and I didn't see anyone who had finished them- what a waste. He ordered the baked potato at a charge but he shared it with me. They give you a huge salad that's drenched in a dressing- Italian maybe. Service was ok- our guy was nice. What I was very irritated by was the staff yelling Excuse Me! every time they needed to get by you. We were a group of 8 trying to make it to a point where we could grab a nice pic of the couple, and so as a group were trying to make our way thru this crowded place. I found it rude the way the girls usually would yell from behind us, Excuse me as they tried to get by. Of course, we moved aside after being yelled at. That is just poor taste from a service stand point. I don't get why this place could be so crowded, except for the view. It's overpriced and low quality. The guy did remove my hubby's steak dinner from the bill so that was good and we appreciated that. We did pay fifteen dollars for the baked potato and my side salad (our table had 18% gratuity added) but I was grateful to not have to pay for his entree.

HOWEVER; One night we order pizza for a party that we were having. Online it told us that we would receive our pizza at 1:15. We waited and waited until it finally hit 1:30. We then started to call the business to see where our order was. But to no avail, because no one ever answered the phone. BTW I was still charged for the food.

So the next day I called the store at 11AM (an hour after advertised opening time) and again, no one answered. I then called again that same day at 4PM and asked for a manager. The manager told me that "They are short employees on Monday nights" and that he saw my order in the morning and was going to void it out for me. \

Now me also working in the food business, I decided not to give the guy a hard time. 

But today. (3 days later) I checked my account and found that the charge still went thru!
So again I called them today at 12AM and again NO ANSWER. I even went as far as to call the pluming store that is right next to Oliveos and they told me that no one was there and that I should waste my time coming down in person to complain.....

So here I am $20.88 Short, with no fricking pizza and no refund.

Hopefully the owner sees this and messages me so I can tell him how to run a business.

p.s. My father owns a pizza joint & the key to a successful business IS STICKING TO YOUR OPERATING HOURS!!!!!!!

Oh gosh where do I start; First off, these people are good for nothing liars. I went in and talked to a woman named Susan. She was very nice and helpful, however when the negotiating started she totally shut down and acted more annoyed than interested in making a sale. Secondly we settled on a price until I noticed that my taxes for a Veloster were almost $4000!!!!! There is no way taxes should be that high!! They then said that the taxes were high because the ADDED the price for my trade-in AFTER they already SUBTRACTED the value of the car. Essentially, making my trade-in $0. After I confronted them about this, they said "oh yeah thats weird" and then changed the taxes to $2500, which would be fine...... If they didn't add the $1500 into a section titles "OTHER FEES"..... they are liars who try to jip you out of money. 

      After all that chaos we were able to settle on another total because of me knowing that they tried to rip me off. At this point i think, "ok maybe all dealerships do this" and I didn't respond to the red flags. I went to financing where I was told I could be financed. Signed all my paperwork and left with the title saying %8.99. 

     The next day I returned to the dealership to receive the detailing for the car because it was out in the rain. I give Susan the car and she runs into the car and proceeds to go get it cleaned. After 50 minutes or so, she comes running after me saying, "WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!!!!! HOW COULD YOU HIT SOMEONE!!". I was bewildered at this point. She went in the back and ran into another dealership car and then tried to BLAME it on me. Simply pathetic. They got everything buffed out and it was not noticeable so I just wanted to leave. 

     After having the car for six days, they call me back one morning and say "Oh, well, your rate has changed to 17%; pay it or bring the car back. No sympathy at all. These people are scammers, cheaters, and lairs.

     It's been 2 weeks and Mark, in the financial department has YET to give me my down payment money back. I called after a week expecting it after telling them to mail it to my address to find that he 'forgot' about it.

Wonderful food and service. I got the beet salad and mixed fries. The salad was enormous. Easily good for two. I would have preferred less dressing is my only complaint. I've been here numerous times. Last time I got the veggie sandwich which was delicious. I'm a vegetarian but everyone else ordered burgers and enjoyed their meals. If you go you HAVE to order the sweet potato fries.

I would have to say this place is hands down some of the best Thai food. It is family owned which is great and nice to support. The seating area isn't very large so it can get crowded. A large group of us from work go there and all enjoy it. I generally call ahead and they can accommodate is with no problem. I've only ordered the vegetarian pad dishes and the curries. My favorite is the green curry. The service is very friendly and the food is great, I highly recommend this place!

To premise my review I've been to Beri many times and with many different people. My friends and I are shocked by the low reviews this establishment receives. In my opinion here are the highlights of this place:

Delicious (not overly sweet) Frozen Yogurt
Many Toppings to choose
Friendly Staff
$1 small to satisfy the craving (cash only for the small)
Punch cards
Friendly Staff
Poppings

The first topping that caught my eye that set this place apart from the rest are the "poppings". These are similar to tapioca / bubble tea balls / boba except they are flavored (mango, passion fruit, etc) juice surrounded with a thin coating. These things POP in your mouth. They are great, everyone should try them out. 

They offer many different flavors of frozen yogurt (~roughly 5-6: green tea, pomegranate, plain, strawberry, taro, and some others)

Final note, everyone but one person that I've brought here enjoys this place.

Great food and people running it.  I highly recommend the vermicelli bowls as they are like nothing I've found elsewhere. Unfortunately I've moved from the area but whenever I'm back I always try to stop back.  

Again: get a Vermicelli bowl.

Definitely worth the detour off of 80 to get some food. They have a huge beer and grilled cheese selection. The main reason for visiting is that they have vegan options here. My friends loved the mushroom grilled cheese. I ordered the buffalo "chicken" grilled cheese and found that there was way too much blue cheese. I asked for more buffalo sauce to counter the overpowering blue cheese. Unfortunatlely I got charged ($0.50) for it. The sandwiches use incredibly thick bread and are quite greasy. Though the greasiness should be expected... Friendly service and good (greasy) food.

Definitely one of the better options along green street. The lunch special rolls are by far the best deal. You get a big piece of naan filled with whatever you choose rolled up and served with pakora. I usually eat about half and finish the rest later. If you're vegan sometimes they will accommodate by using Roti instead of Naan.

The menu is on eatcu's website.

I can only comment on the vegetarian food. From other people in my party though they seemed to really enjoy the meat dishes. I found the food to be the best chinese food in this area. They cooked the eggplant perfectly. Most places I find it's either to chewy or too dry. They got it dead on. The cripsy tofu is delicious. I recommend ordering 2 dinner dishes for 3 people. That will be more than enough food. When eating here for dinner be sure to allow for 45 minutes for your food to come. Though, I went with a group for lunch and went at the beginning of the lunch hour and our food arrived within 20 minutes. Anyways I highly recommend this place.

I went here for a friend's graduation dinner. The seating area was filled. We had reservations and they were right on time. The service and level of professionalism was great. The menu is vegan friendly with a few delicious options. I tried a friend's baked eggplant dish and it was by far the best eggplant course I've ever had. Many people in my party ordered the lasagna and loved it. I ordered the pesto and was disappointed. The homemade noodles were good but the pesto didn't have the pop of basil I was hoping for. Despite the pesto sauce, the experience as a whole was great. I would definitely recommend this establishment.

I live in NYC and do yoga/pilates religiously so when I took a week trip out to Phoenix to visit family, I was looking for a great studio to take classes. Well.... I stumbled across the Joyful Yoga Studio online and decided to take a pilates class.  It was great. The studio is clean and spacious, the owner is super friendly, and the instructor was amazing. After that, I ended up taking 6 classes over the course of 3 days. The prices are amazing -- especially coming from NYC. ALSO- in NYC, TRX is all the rage EVERYWHERE. It's the new pilates-- the results are AMAZING. It's awesome that this studio offers it. 

I highly recommend taking classes here!

This place advertises right on top of the menu that they can do vegan, but really don't bother if your looking for vegan ramen. There's a bunch of ramen options in the valley so save yourself this one. The Tofu isn't vegan (god knows how you screw that up), so you're basically left with broth, noodles and corn when they pull out all the animals. Unless you're me, then they leave the eggs in it and still charge you when you return it and ask not to have it remade. And that's $12 for water, noodles and some corn mind you. Probably do just as good for what you get going to the dollar store, but again, I got eggs in mine, so who knows what it tastes like. I'm guessing broth and noodles.

HORRIBLE place and experience. 

Mike and his crew just got done screwing me over for a 90K mile check. I actually brought in the 90K schedule for my car, which stated very clearly what to do, as well as told him what to do, and all he managed was about half, but still charged for everything. He didn't even change the oil!

Now I have to get another 90K service somewhere else just to make up for all the things he decided weren't worth his time. I USED to take both of my cars there, but never again. 

GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

Worst experience I have ever had at Culver's. In addition to being charged for my second item in my concrete mixer. I got to hear the staff talk back to the manager, telling them not to talk down to them, and that if there were things to do they would be doing it. 

The employee taking the order (who was obviously a trainee) didn't mark my mixer as a "later" order as I asked. So my mixer arrived before my food. The employee said "here's your custard" slammed it on the table and walked away quickly. About two minutes later the rest of my order arrived. I explained to the trainee my custard was supposed to be later. He took it and said "sorry, we'll throw it away and make a new one when you're ready." 

Once I finished my order I went back to the counter with my receipt and asked for my custard. The manager gave me a new number and marked it on the receipt and told it would be right out. I heard her tell them it needed to be made. Sat waiting for 10 minutes before I walked back up to inquire where my order was. The employee behind the counter pawned it off on the employee working the custard area, "he wants to know where his later custard is. He's been waiting for 10 mins." The trainee says "no one told me." He looks at the receipt with the order and asked what kind it is again. Finally get my custard about three minutes later with a "sorry, sir."

Oh and they are having a holiday sweepstakes that is not available to folks living in CA. Thanks for making me feel welcome! I don't need to eat here ever again.

Hhgregg is the worst!  Where do I even start.  I purchased refrigerator, stove, and dishwasher in February...   Saving money was not worth it.  First, the delivery guys come in said the refrigerator will not fit.  Well i did the measurements and it would.  They spoke spanish to each other.  All of the sudden the refrigerator was damaged and the did not let me see it. Delivered another on Sunday.    Second, they got the stove in,  they supposively shut off the gas as my valve is in the basement.  They claimed it could not move the stove all the way back, that i need a gas company to move the line.  This was all done on Friday.   Monday, I go in my kitchen i smelled gas.  Called the gas company to find out HHGREGG did not use the shutoff valve but loosed a bolt.  I watched them, what did i know.   Then i got Mertz to come to move gas line.  $135 later to find out they can move the stove back.   Thirdly, they put my dishwasher in crookedly.  They had to come back.  They unscrewed one side and shoved it in.  Then the disposal kept backing up in my dishwasher. I called they said that was normal.  I said no it is not.  The same guy came, moved one piece said should be good.  Heck no, called again, they made service call again.  The,people never called for time range, i called they said it is scheduled and no time. That i cannot call until after 530 if they do not show. Then called nothing, called the next day. Finally they got someone there.  He said it was hooked up wrong a suppoively fixed it.  Guess what it was not fixed and seriously another repeat, no call for time just got off after an 1.5 hour time, mostly hold and transfers.  No time again.  They to call me and suppoively sending me 100 dollars, better not be a gift card.  Bc they cannot pay me a milloin dollars,to EVER shop at another HHGREGG again!

Matt arrived when he said he would and gave us a quote before starting the job. He did clean a small amount of the tile and grout so we could see what the finished job would look like, which was very helpful. He cleaned everything up before he left and the quality of the work met our expectations and then some. I would highly recommend Excel Floor Care.

Terry Hind arrived promptly at the stated time. Our issue was that the bathroom shower was not getting any cold water so was too hot to use.  He diagnosed the problem right away.  When he went to turn off the water at the outside shut-off valve, he found it was too corroded to shut off.  I had to call the city to have the main turned off and Terry was very accommodating to go buy the needed parts while we waited.  The repairs were made in good time and to our complete satisfaction.

CUSTOMER DISSERVICE.  I have been going to Golden Apple for years.  Usually I wait 10-15 minutes at each appointment, which is bad enough, but this time was the worst.  For this last appointment, I was asked to come in 10-15 minutes early to complete new paperwork due to management or ownership change, I wasn't clear on the reason.  Anyway, I arrived early as requested, completed my paperwork and was shown to the procedure room on time.  I should say that the receptionist was unsmiling and bordering on rude.  In addition, the person who showed me to the room was not knowledgeable and evasive with my two or three questions, telling me to ask the doctor on each of them.  Thirty minutes later, no one had come to inform me of a reason for the delay, or an estimate of how much longer the wait would be.  In fact, I thought I was forgotten.  So I went to the receptionist, who informed me that the doctor was with a new patient and should be finished any minute.  No apology, or even acknowledgment of my inconvenience; in fact, her attitude was almost to the effect of feeling bothered.  After returning to the room and waiting another 5-8 minutes, I left after being at my appointment for more than 50 minutes.  I had rearranged my work day and simply did not have time for the procedure, especially since I had no idea how much longer I'd have to wait.  In my opinion, Dr. Figueroa and the staff at Golden Apple do not respect their patients' time, or at least that of their existing patients.  New patients, beware.  I certainly hope Golden Apple does not have a policy to charge for missed appointments.  That would be a joke considering the disrespect they show their existing patients through the complete lack of regard for their time.  I highly advise trying one of the many other medical spas in the West Valley.

A fast casual, yet high quality, great tasting BBQ restaurant is something you don't find too often, but this place is the real deal. Simple menu, yet had all of the classic BBQ staples you would expect. I did the two neat plate, ribs and brisket plus beans and Carolina cold slaw with some cornbread to top it off. All five items were delicious, and you can tell great care went into choosing the ingredients and cooking the food. Highly recommend, my only complaint is that they don't have one in the east valley where I live :)

This place was fun for the first 10 min and that was paying and filling out the waiver. I get the fact that there needs to be rules, but to a certain point it isn't fun anymore. Whenever one of my kids fell, he was yelled at and pointed out and told he has to stand up. He's not a professional at this. I was giving a parent pass for my 2 year old who's was cool because it was free and I could guide him most of the time. I was told over and over to stop stepping in the trampoline because I only has a free parent pass. How was I suppose to help my 2 year old when he fell or went on the wrong trampoline? The place seemed pretty clean and well staffed. This was our first time here and I was let down. My 2 kids wanted to leave after 40 min. I would definitely not have a party here in the filter considering the fact you can't rally have fun while jumping especially when I invite others here. They have a good selection of drinks and snacks and sitting area for the parents. Thanks for the free socks, but we won't be returning anytime soon

This has to be the best (kids) dentist ever! My kids love coming here. They have so much for the kids to do here and it really distracts them from actually being at the dentist. It is always very clean and the staff are all really nice. We have never had to wait longer than 15 min in the waiting room which is probably the best part for the kids. They have a projector playing movies, iPads, a fish tank that covers the whole wall, a huge wave and also an arcade machine! The rooms that you are put in are also very nice and relaxing for the kids. The have tv on the ceiling and will put on whatever your kids want to watch while they are with the dentist. My kids leave here happy and aren't usually too scared to come because they know as well as I do that it will be a fun and good appointment.  Can't say that we have ever had a problem or complaint. I really recommend this dentist for all parents

Decided to try this place out finally (Friday 5/12/17) and was disappointed... Came here for some drinks and to play a little. Not too many people inside which was nice for a Friday night, we were able to get 2 machines next to each other. The inside was nice and had a good feel too it. I would live to try the food but I don't think I'll be coming back. The bartender gave us no attention at all. I waited almost 15 minutes to get my second beer, And I was playing too! Once we decided to cash out we were still charged for all of our drinks (2 beers and 1 cocktail) we both were playing too. We also noticed another couple come in and sit at a table and nobody walked up and helped them at all for at least 10-15 minutes. Pretty much the service here is horrible. I'm a bartender and my wife is a waitress so I understand how it is sometimes but when it's not busy there is no reason why anyone should be waiting for a beer especially when we are there to spend money

My wife and I have been waiting to go here for a while, we finally made time to bring the family in. We went around 11:30, it was pretty busy, We were seated right away, which was good because we brought both kids. Our waitress approached us as soon as we were seated and let us know about the menu and how everything works. We ordered for our kids right away and orders drinks for ourselves. My wife ordered a bloody Mary and Our waitress recommended a beer for me, so I decided to go with it. When she returned she brought the Bloody Mary and the kids drinks, 20 min or so went by and still no beer for me.... My wife decides to ask the waitress and she said there must be a problem at the bar, I noticed she went to the computer and put my beer through because she must have forgot to put it in. got my beer another 10 minutes later (30 min after I ordered it). The kids got sliders, and we ordered the huntsman burger and calamari to share. we got the burger (no side plates) and kids sliders but no calamari. The burger was delicious! once we finished our burger we asked the waitress if the calamari was coming out still. She went to the kitchen and returned with no calamari and told us our order was bumped..... Not sure what that means or how that happened. We get the calamari 10 min later and ask to get it to go since we were already done with everything else.  The food was ok, the service wasn't so great.

Took the family here since we loved the Gen in Torrance California. We Went on a Tuesday night and still found a long line. Hostess told us only a 20 minute wait, ended up taking 45 min, I love Korean BBQ so it was worth the wait. The crappy part of waiting was watching parties the same size or with 1 more than our party get seated first. I decided to ask and they said that a table of 5 had to be seated first because the table of 5 was ready (we he 4 in our party) not sure how that worked. Once we were seated we were greeted right away and I was ready to order. I asked for the premium steak, 2 orders of brisket and the marinated steak. They ended up bringing everything except for the second brisket. You are allowed to order 4 meats, every time we asked for more than 1 of a meat they wouldn't bring it. Service was really good at first, It went to a crap after the first 30 min (it's a 2 hour minimum) which is fine but me and the wife didn't leave full at all. Our waiter seemed to try and not make eye contact every time he walked by, we would have to ask the busser or anyone else that walked by for our next meat. Once we were ready to go, I looked over he check and they charged my 4 year old and 2 year old 10$ each for all you can eat. They both only had rice.... Not sure how that works. Definitely won't be returning here.

This was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. First of all we were seated in some tucked away corner were we couldn't even see the restaurant and it seemed like we were a little neglected because of it. Our food came out and we ordered calamari, margherita pizza, Italian sausage pizza and some raviolis. The calamari was the only thing that was good and warm. I really liked the pesto sauce that they came with! But the margherita pizza was cold and lacked flavor, other pizza was cold and the raviolis were rubbery. Worst of all with this meal were my drinks. The water that they gave us when we first got there had a funny taste like the glass hadn't been washed or the ice that was in it was really old and had sat in a freezer too long. I thought that when I got my coke that maybe the flavor wouldn't be in that drink but sure enough it was in that drink too. Because of this experience I probably won't go back to this restaurant.

I came to this buffet because of the ratings it had on different sites. I liked the way the buffet was set up and most of the food tasted pretty good. However there was some food that was cold or that just didn't taste right. The price was okay. It was $41 for the dinner hours.

My wife and I went just for one of their famous sundaes and it was pretty good but the service was HORRIBLE!! We ordered and the waiter acted put off that we only ordered a sundae probably thinking he wouldn't be tipped well because we were just getting desert. In the end we asked for our bill and he gave us an empty folder. No bill, no nothing. We tried to remember how much the sundae was and put in the amount of cash that we thought would cover it. When he came back there was still no receipt or anything just the change. When my wife and I talked about it afterwards we wondered if our waiter even put our money in the register or if he was just keeping it since there was no printed proof given to us that he did or not. Anyway we will probably be back because it is pretty good for deserts and we've been other times and the service has been okay.

Seeing this show earlier tonight compelled me to sign up for Yelp, and I would give it 10 stars if I could. 

I sat close to the stage and a small part of the first act was partially obscured, but I literally can't think of anything else negative to say about it.

I was beyond impressed, and I would highly recommend seeing this show.

Do not use. Not reliable. Paid $1500 deposit in Oct 2013 and still cannot deliver.  Never responded to my phone or emails. Had to remind few times. Now he wrote an email that he has filed for bankruptcy.

Hard to find a good electronics store.  I went here to buy an all in one printer, scanner, etc. and a new more upgraded modem/router.  Totally expecting to drop between $500 and $600.   I had many questions.  That's why i went to the store instead of online.  I picked out a modem/router but the didn't have the brand i was looking for.  then i went over to the printers.  Lots of sales people but not one of them asked if I needed any assistance.  I put the modem/router back and left.  i remember the guys from FyxIt telling me to go to Office Depot.  So that's where I went to purchase the modem/router.  haven't decided on a printer.  lots of choices there.

There were a lot of choices for tequila, however, maybe a total of 3 ounces in the very well Iced drink.   The chips were interesting but the dips we had were very good and flavorful.  I had the steak tacos with black beans, rice, and some kind of pickled medley.  The place was almost dark as there was no lighting at the tables nor above us and we had to use our iPhone flashlights to read the tiny writing on the menus.   My meal was cold.   The bill was wrong but we worked it out amongst ourselves to get it right.  For $40 I don't think I'll be going back.

While on my way through Wisconsin, I searched for quilt stores.  Mill House got rave reviews and 5 stars.  Totally worth my stop.  5 miles off the interstate.  I spent lots of $$ in this place.  Loved the building, supplies, patterns, quilts on the wall, and the fabric.  Absolutely, going back.

There were 5 of us who tried Oishi.  All of us loved our appetizers and dishes.  No wait.  Great service.  The wine was excellent as well.  The atmosphere was really nice.  Not very many people in the restaurant.  It might tend to be loud if there is a crowd.  But what restaurant isn't these days!!!

the technician didn't even know what an intake pipe was.  

told me the bacteria fighter, which they installed, had gone out of business so they don't make any bulbs for it anymore.  WRONG!  but of course i could purchase a new system, which was a better company, etc.  I'm sure they said the same kind of sales pitch when they installed the original one.  Anyways, my bulb is ordered from the out of business company.  LOL.  

Then we discussed the outtake and how it was not code, which he didn't agree with me even though other furnace people and an inspector had stated so.  after many phone calls to the engineer, it finally came around to yes, it was against code.  the engineer had to be researching it as well.  with every phone call, he kept getting closer to what i had already determined.  but of course it was code back when they installed it.  I beg to differ.  but that's for another day.  

then they also said that cutting the intake pipe just above the ceiling is common practice.  allowing all the crap, dust, mice, etc. to fall into the intake pipe.  most furnace people tell me they have never seen it cut off above the ceiling.  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS BULLCRAP.  

NEVER USE THESE PEOPLE!

I ordered sweet cream ice cream with pecans, raspberries, and fudge.  when I got to the car I had eaten most of the topping.  They only put the extras on the top.  Made it look like it was mixed in.  I think this is really, really bad business and makes it even more expensive.   Never again.

food was good but when the owner started yelling at the waitress that's when I said i'm not coming back.  NEVER NEVER NEVER do that in front of your guests.  Actually, yelling rarely gets you anywhere with people.  She wasn't at fault.  sad sad place.  I've put this on here before but for some reason, my review was taken off.  wonder why or  how???

We ate there last night.  Noticed the outside looks inviting.  Nice comfortable booths and tables inside.  It's small but that's what so charming about the place.  The option of 3 sauces with your chips is totally amazing.  I tried them all and ended up mixing them.  I just wonder what happens to them after people are done???  are they recycled???  The waiter was attentative and the food was very flavorful, too. Very large soft drinks.   Hand made items.  I think it cost a little over $20 for two adults.

Simply incredible. These guys have the latest gear in stock, the staff is polite, helpful and they know about the products they're selling. Another great thing is that all the items (At least all the ones I've seen) are MSRP. This is the best football gear store I have ever been to by a mile.

Ralph was recommended to us by Mike at Storage West on Bell Road in Scottsdale.  We had a request for someone to unload our truck in short notice, he was able to accommodate us very quickly and efficiently.  Most professional and very careful.  Would definitely use them again.  Thank you
